1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Apr 2019I personally feel that the best way to learn is by doing. I can read a thousand books about investments but if you don't perform it, it is tough understanding the emotions and how tough it is to apply what is taught in books onto reality.One very good example books like to quote ""Buy low sell high""These books will plot your 50-day Moving Average, your 200-day Moving Average on a historical chart, and will circle out the various intersection points, advising you to buy when it's upward intersection and sell when it crosses once more downwards. These are your entry / exit points to Buy Low Sell High.Similarly, almost all of Warren Buffett's books will let you in on his famous rules.Rule #1 - Don't lose moneyRule #2 - Don't forget Rule #1Now, when you come out to the market, how easy is it to replicate it? I'd say 90% of people would fail at it. Simply because, it is always easier pointing out the past rather than predicting the future. I think that is why many think trading is easy, simply because there are too many books / workshops out there 'guaranteeing success' through historical trades / investments and they don't paint you the full picture, making 150% in 2 days but perhaps losing 300% in 3 days (Slight exaggeration here) but I hope you get my pointHowever, that being said, don't get me wrong, education is still important, and personally, my take on learning is to learn concepts, not strategies. Learn how market works, what causes prices to rise and fall, and most importantly behavioural analysis. Through this understanding of concepts, find the strategy that best fits your comfort zone0 comments5"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 11 Apr 2019I believe so!A good education, whether financial or not, can lay the groundwork for other forms of investments later on. For example, you need to at least have some form of education on how the markets work, how to read financial statements and how to evaluate companies before you can invest in the stock market.Even primary school education, at the P5 and P6 level with complex exam questions, trains the way you think and forces you to work your brain muscle. These payoffs may not be apparent immediately, but I believe they helped me with my thinking even now. So I feel that having a strong foundation in primary school, is still very helpful for the future.But still, I believe that much more has to be focused on other than academic education. If you account for a holistic education, I think it's the best investment you can ever make.0 comments3"
3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Apr 2019Hello!I personally think that investing in education would be one of the best investment that I will make. Education is essential as it teaches you how to think and also how to be a better person. Besides the typical go to university to get a degree so that you will be able to get a good job, i believe that education is the key to many other things. Education will be able to give you the knowledge that you need in order to help us develop a perspective in life. If we are talking about education in terms of going to school, going to school will help us to get to know more people better and expand our social circle. Knowing more people will allow us to know more about the world.To conclude, I believe that education is very important and is would be the best investment as it has taught me many basic things about life and will still continue teaching me more in the future. To end off, here is a quote by Benjamin Franklin that i think would answer your question! 0 comments1"
