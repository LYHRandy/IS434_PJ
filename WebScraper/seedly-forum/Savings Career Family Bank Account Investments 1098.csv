1,"Wilson Nid A BreakLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 May 2019If you had NO academic/theory background in Maritime Studies, then might be worth considering taking it. the master degree can also help you in establishing your first circle of network for this industryHowever, this industry is more of a learning-on-the job, so there's still plenty you need to learn on the practical side even when you obtained a ""MSc in Maritime Studies"". A more viable (cost-effective) route would be taking the qualifications from Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers (best if you get subisdy/sponsor by your company) while working in the industry.  http://www.ics.org.sg/qualifications All in all, a Masters in Maritime Studies, is just one of the many ways to enter the industry. Beside, Singapore is currently the maritime hub of the world to be in, so there's no lack of opportunities if you keep knocking on the ""doors"".Lastly, I would recommend working 1-3 years after your BSc before taking your MSc. Not many employers want to hire someone with a MSc with no working experience these days, and you might end up competing for the same jobs with people with only BSc qualifications.0 comments4"

ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019What are your reasons for taking this masters degree?Is this necessary to climb the current career ladder / switch?If for a career switch, have you verified with different companies that they will require a masters for the particular job or field which you are interested in?It is difficult for any one of us to tell you exactly if you would be better off taking this masters or not.Without knowing your current financial situation and your mother's current financia situation and your real reasons for taking this masters degree, any advice given here will be highly inaccurate and/or inappropriate.Please consider a qualified financial adviser and career coach for your question.I will be able to point you in the right direction.

WizardAnswered on 28 May 2019Imo if she is supportive of your endeavors, and it's something that you want to do, then you should do it.And, make your mum proud, do well in your career and return her the favour many many times over ;)It's not often that mum's are so supportive (especially financially) like that!0 comments2"

I think it is worth the potential return for this deal.   Furthermore it is from your mom.Alternatively what if you further study without loaning from her, e.g part time work, loan from friends.It is your choice man :)  All the best for your future :)1 comment1"
