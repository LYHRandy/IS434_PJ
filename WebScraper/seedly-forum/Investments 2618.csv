1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Feb 2019Growth investing involves investors who are attracted to companies that are expected to grow faster than the rest. Growth stocks likely carries more risk since they offer higher upside potential. The stock prices swings in greater magnitude, thus it is best suited for risk-tolerant investors with a longer time horizon. While value investing is about finding companies whose stock prices don't necessarily reflect their fundamental worth. Investors seek businesses trading at a share price that's considered a bargain. investors typically benefit from dividend payments. Growth investment is also likely to be a safer investment than growth stocks.0 comments1"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Feb 2019Investors who practice growth investing look for companies have strong earning growth potential while value investors look for stocks that are undervalued. Growth investing may focus on stocks that have higher PE multiples, because they expect the share prices to increase as the companies continue to grow. These stocks may have strong growth records even during economic slumps, and may be more volatile given its high prices where adverse news can cause prices to tumble. Value investors may focus on stocks that the market does not value, but could still have strong fundamentals behind them. These investors bet on the fact that the market will realise the true value of the stock, and that share prices will increase over time. These shares may be priced below the broader market, and could also be priced lower than their comparables.0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 27 Feb 2019Putting it in simple words below based on my own understanding.Growth investing are investment into companies that have high chance of growth in revenue, earnings etc looking at income statement and business strategy. with increase in earnings, revenue etc, the stock price supposedly will go up as well.Value investing are investment into companies that are not being priced correctly by the market using valuation metric (pe, p/b, dcf, p/cnav etc) which one can arbitrage in the future. and the fundamentals of the company is sound. Eg. increasing revenue, increasing earnings, low debt ratio, positive cashflow etc.0 comments0"
