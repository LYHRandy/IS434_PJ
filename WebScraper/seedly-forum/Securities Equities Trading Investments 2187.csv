1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Just a little meme I found online:) But in all seriousness, I think a good simple reference point would be to look at Boeing before they announced their Airmax 737 model. I would assume instituitional and retail analysts then would have forecasted their future Cashflows based off that and priced in their stock. However that would not factor in the recent scare and fall in public confidence towards Boeing planes in general. This would be hard to calculate, but the good news is if you are looking to capitalize at an opportunity like this, the fall in public confidence is probably temporary in your opinion against the LR potential of the company. If so, unless you feel markets are underreacting to the current track of flight bans- or that the worst is not over, there already exists a good opportunity to buy into Boeing right now.2 comments3"
2,"Kenneth Lou14 Mar 2019Haha good analysis. Thinking to go long on it personally.Isaac Chan14 Mar 2019Personally I think the market is over-reacting, just like how people over-react when there are plane crashes, despite sitting in a car being more dangerous than flying on a plane. Probably just fear of flight."

If the market does not correct on Airbus, and still undervalues Boeing, a strategy you can consider is to buy Boeing and short Airbus. There's potential for higher returns here but risk exposure also higher.0 comments1"
