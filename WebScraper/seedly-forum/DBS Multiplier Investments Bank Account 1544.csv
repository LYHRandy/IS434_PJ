The good thing about multiplier is that the conditions can be met thru different accounts.However do note that the additional interest is only paid on the multiplier account itself thus i put all my money there to get the extra interest. (E.g. Transfering the dividends from POSB to Multiplier as soon as its credited)0 comments0
