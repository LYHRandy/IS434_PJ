2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Jun 2019Are u refering to the retirement topping up scheme (top up special account)? The $14k is the max relief for that scheme, $7k for topping up your own special account, and $7k for topping up your parents, spouse etc account (T&C applies). SRS is a different scheme with its own limit. SRS tax relief is $15,300 for singapore residents.0 comments0"
