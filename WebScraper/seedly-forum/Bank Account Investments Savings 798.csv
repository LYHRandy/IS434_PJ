ProdigyUpdated on 20 Jul 2019Hi Alcander!Taking the assumption that you're a student and thus, would not be able to qualify for Salary Crediting, Credit Card Spend, Home/Car Loans and/or Investments. Here are the top 3 Saving Accounts you can go for with the highest interest rates.P.S. Calculated/Researched based on this formula (Base Interest + Bill/Giro Payment + Other Bonuses)1) Maybank's Save Up ProgrammeBase interest rate: 0.3125%one Maybank product or service, Giro Payment Bonus (of at least $300): 0.3%Total attainable interest: 0.6125%Source: Maybank2) Bank of China's SmartSaverBase interest rate: 0.25%Payment Bonus (3 bill payments of at least S$30 each): 0.35%Total attainable interest: 0.6%Source: Bank of China3) CIMB FastSaver AccountBase interest (First $50, 000): 1%Base interest (Next $25, 000): 1.5%Base interest (Above $75, 000): 0.60%Source: CIMBBased on our assumptions and interest rate formula, CIMB's FastSaver Account will provide you with the highest interest rate at 1% which will be ideal for you at this juncture.However, don't just hear this from me, do check out what our community have to say by reading their reviews: https://seedly.sg/reviews/savings-accountsAlso, for a more detailed breakdown for all available savings accounts, do check out our Best Savings Account Cheat Sheet here: https://blog.seedly.sg/best-savings-accounts-singapore/Last but not least, do note that you can use Seedly's Savings Account Calculator to find out which service provider is best for you: https://seedly.sg/tools/savings-account-calculatorI hope this will help!0 comments4"

The interest rate for this account is 1% and interest is calculated daily so long you have at least $1000 each day. There is no fall below fee so you can have $0 in the bank account and not kena any bankdraft or whatsoever. Since there is limited ATMs for CIMB, I always do a FAST transfer from CIMB to OCBC for withdrawals or vice versa for deposits.5 comments2"

4,"Fan ZDLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 16 Jun 2019Seeing as you would have no regular income as a student, I would go for CIMB FastSaver - no min. Fall below fee, 1 percent interest rate with no criteria to fulfill. Park money in the fixed deposit for up to 1.9 percent interest currently. Note that this account is online only (no atm withdrawal).Alternatively, if you prefer to invest your savings, you can consider banks where you can access certain investment features. Example being OCBC with their Blue Chip investment plan.3 comments2"

Then look at the savings accounts and banks to go withAlcander Seow16 Jun 2019Currently, just looking for a way/s to increase my assets with little to no risk. But at max prep to open only 3 bank account. Priority right now, is to saving $$ and invesy slightly ($50 - $100)."
6,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 17 Jun 2019Hiya, I opened a CIMB FastSaver account at your age for the no frills 1% interest rate as the others have mentioned. It is safe, easy to apply for online (on desktop) but their mobile app is a little bit slow and less user friendly than POSB or OCBC. I still use Frank as my main spending account and closed my POSB.When comparing CIMB to OCBC+, I still prefer CIMB because there is no withdrawal penalty i.e. the interest rate stays the same. This is unlike OCBC+ which encourages you not to withdraw at all. I would rather place the $$ into Singapore Savings Bond or a 3-6 month Fixed Deposit since interest rates for these are above 1.45%. Also, it may be hard to place a min sum of $500 of savings into that account monthly to hit the higher interest rate, unless you have a job or tuition gig that pays really well. Just my two cents.Btw, I'm not sure when you are entering NS, but when you do, POSB Save As You Serve interest rates are better than CIMB during that period if you credit your pay into the account. https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/says3 comments1"
7,"See all 3 comments Pat17 Jun 2019You can't withdraw fixed deposits during the period which you have placed it with them and you will get a fixed interest rate of 1.5-2.0% (based on current schemes). You can only place fresh funds with the bank for fixed deposits. Most banks require a min of 10/20k placement for the fixed deposits so only consider this option if you have sufficient savings. If not, choose the CIMB 1% frills-free option. Note, only get a FD if you think you won't require the sum during the period of time and keep emergency funds too!Pat17 Jun 2019For >$10k, I think the CIMB Fixed Deposit is pretty decent for 3/6 months. https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/en/personal/news-and-promotions/promotions/accounts/cimb-fast-fixed-deposit-promo.html"
