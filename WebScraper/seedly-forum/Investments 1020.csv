If you're investing for growth, you're looking for compounded return. If you're investing for income, you're looking at receiving dividends.When you're young and your capital is a little low, you need to compound it. When you're a little older, you can start choosing to receive and spend your dividends to achieve financial independence.0 comments2"

It really depends on your own preferences, and what stage of life you are at (different needs arise at different points). The main reason why we would want to reinvest is so that we benefit from the compounded returns years later. Simplistically, think about it as the marshmallow experiment and the concept of delayed gratification. You need to decide if you want to eat the marshmallow now, or wait a little longer to get two marshmallows.0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 09 Jun 2019When you are young and just started investing, re-invest is better to allow you to increase your portfolio size. Bigger portfolio, more dividends. Until one day the dividends are so huge and it is more than your employment income, then you can consider using it to fund lifestyle.0 comments0"
