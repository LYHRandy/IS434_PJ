question,"Education Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Dec 2018I'm doing my uni as well as modelling at the same time. Should I drop uni to focus on my career for now?I'm earning quite a big amount for my modelling, and I'm definitely making way above the average pay grade of a fresh grad. Modelling takes up a lot of my time, and school seems like a waste to be doing something that will not help me in my career anyway8 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Dec 2018I believe if you are doing well in modeling go all  out and milk it for what it’s worth.you can always apply to study later.The key point is you need to have an exit strategy . What comes after modeling? 0 comments1"
2,"Siti PutriLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 13 Dec 2018I used to model (runaway and prints) too in my late teens till 27. I agree some of the modelling jobs gave me good pay. I actually did it while studying and even while working a full time job. Take leave to do the modelling job or weekends. It all depends on your priority to juggle your schedule.I don't know about you, but my last catwalk show was when I was 27. I was the oldest person as majority were in late teens or early twenties. Not trying to be racist but oftentimes I was one of the few Asian models out of 20+ models in a show, as the rest are Caucasian or pan-Asian. This means jobs depends on clients' preference on ethnic background too.One also need to be strong psychologically as easy to get influenced by some other models with eating disorders and smoking to lose weight myth.These days with social media influencer, it is much harder to get a modelling job unless you have many followers too. Almost everyone can filter photo and be influencer or model.What I am saying is jobs like modelling while well paid has a life span. Your life stages changes too supposing as a parent or pregnancy (stretch marks) if you are female. Your education is important as something to fall back on. 0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 13 Dec 2018If you don't enjoy what you're studying now, your degree would be of minimal use to you when you graduate. Why not find something that you like learning about more? I always believe in not wasting the time wasted, so if you're still in time to convert your current major to a minor and pursue sth else more to your liking, do it. This would be a safety net for future job hunting, as other commenters have mentioned.If you find yourself studying what you like, then i believe you will be better able to juggle both modelling and studying. I have to first admit that i dont know enough of the modelling industry, im speaking about it as a gig industry with a project-based income and your ""shelf-life"" could be limited like what Siti mentioned. If after graduation you want to do it full-time, so be it as you have a degree as a base to start a new career elsewhere. But i kinda hope you can use modelling as a base if you really really like it, then move on to hosting/acting/being the next Tyra Banks. The piece of paper your degree is printed on would then be of no use but I'm sure there are some life skills along the way that you would find valuable, and some friends that hopefully stay with you for long. By then the 4 years in uni would just be a little blip in your life, no need to worry too much about it.All the best!0 comments0"
5,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Dec 2018If you can i would suggest you continue doing both. A degree is always helpful. If u want to pick it up again later when your modelling career is over, it is not so easy.Can you parlay your modelling career into other things as well, eg acting or hosting talk shows etc etc? If so you stand a better chance of surviving for the long term.Pls remember us when u become famous.0 comments0"
6,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Dec 2018My point is rather different, if you know what you're doing, then go for it. After all, the journey to degree is for the sake of earning $ at the end of the day. If model can earn more, go for it hard and fast! Make a lot of $ with it! Just make sure you don't waste the $, invest what you've earn or start a business while you're doing modelling so you have something aloneside that is sustainable and may fall back on when you no longer want to model or up to certain age. Just like what Siti said, there's a shelf life as a model, while you have it good, make good use of the  $ earn and reinvest into a business, equity and yourself for future.All the best ! :) 0 comments0"
7,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Dec 2018Modelling has its requirements. Can you maintain the model shape long enough? How long do you intend to do? (Not all models are in their 40s and 50s, so you can work as model for 20 years max.) Also, would you have intention to have biological kids? If so, that shaves off at least a year. Menstruation/periods? What then will you do when you can no longer do modelling? 0 comments0"
8,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Dec 2018Do you foresee yourself in this industry for a long time? Will it be able to sustain you until you can retire? If not, then a degree is necessary as something to fall back on. If the industry suffers or if you are deemed not suitable for the industry anymore, at least you can still fall back on your degree.0 comments0"
