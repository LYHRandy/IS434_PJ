1,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2018Hi, from what I've read it seems like they are all very similar.. I've listed down as below for you to refer to.All requires minimum income of 30,000 per annum and no, I do not encourage you to take up such loans if possible.. That said, if you do really need to take up the loan please read all clauses and make sure all vague terms are identified and inked to protect yourself.​Citi Quick Cash: 1hr approval, minimum of $1000 withdrawal.Citi Credit Ready: Up to 4x monthly salary. Not immediate approval.. comes with cheque book.Citi Credit Ready Paylite: 1hr approval, up to 4x monthly salary.​Hope that helps!0 comments0"
