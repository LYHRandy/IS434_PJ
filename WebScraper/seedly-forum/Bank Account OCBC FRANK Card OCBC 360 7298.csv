1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Sep 2019Definitely OCBC 360! On the bank side, they are focusing on the interest tiers to be on this account.FRANK was more for a student or undergraduate segment.The war is always between OCBC360 vs DBS Multiplier vs UOB ONE which caters towards the working adult segment.0 comments1"
2,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 13 Sep 2019If you are working... 360 for sure. I am actually getting more than $100 of interest monthly now from 360, and not so much on the Frank which I use as a spending acct.But I really love OCBC. 
No long queues @ atm.
The savings goals are so awesome I am moving to do envelope budgeting with them.So my system is my salary goes to the 360.
So does most of the giro, and I pay my credit cards from it.On 23rd, my salary comes in. 
On 25th, the savings goals start the automated monthly savings into the goals and lock my money up. 
On the 28th, the automated fund transfers spend money out to give allowances to myself n parents. Within the first three days of next month, the loan deduction happens. 
On the first Sunday of every month I look at the final credit card bill and set the future payments to pay them off 2 days before the due date. I release money from the goals to make the money available (yes now I also have a savings goal for credit card spend).On the 17th or so, the deduction for BCIP happens, and by 20th - 24th, the credit card payments get processed, and the cycle restarts.A whole load of automation.At every quarter-end (3/6/9/12), I track the balance that's left in the savings goal and then feed that info into my next year budget.1 comment0"

Even if you don't have CC with OCBC 360, having money going in monthly gives you bonus interest.And since you won't be spending money on that account, you'll definitely be able to unlock another bonus interest by having your balance increase by at least $500 from the previous month.The saving goals features are available in 360 too so it's pretty helpful!0 comments0"
