1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Feb 2019Pareto principle- there’s many ways to interpret this. How i see this is that 80% of market/portfolio outperformance come from 20% of the best stocks. Although less visible during market rallies, over a longer term horizon(few years) this is usually clearer.Another one i believe in is “buying in when the streets are filled with blood” which i heard from ray dalio. Steep selloffs(few in recent years)present good buying opportunities. It is important however to read up the reason behind the prevailing market sentiment. For eg. during feb 2018 the us markets were hit with the steepest selloff overnight without much cause. Analysts suspected it was triggered by algorithmic traders who bought into the panic. Immediately i knew this was a good dip to buy into, which paid off within 2 months with ~20% returns for my buys.0 comments0"
