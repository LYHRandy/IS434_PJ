MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Look to buy insurance (death, critical illness and total permanent disability) when you are still young and in good health. As you won't know what happens in the future. If something were to happen (God forbid) and you want to buy insurance, you may find that it will get really expensive and you may even be denied coverage.Look towards buying term insurance as it's much cheaper as compared to whole life, and definitely avoid ILPs as the fees will kill you over time. Hope this helps0 comments0"
