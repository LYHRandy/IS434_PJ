1,"Casey ChooLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Oct 2018There's a couple of factors you'd have to take into considerations regarding ""time in the market"". The simplest rules I'd tend to fall back upon is ​1) How much am I willing to put in for my first investment? More than what I'm comfortable with? Or less?2) You'd probably have to do some basic research on the investment types you're thinking of buying. Say for example, its P/L expectations3) Never go in regardless!! Always make sure you do your research or ask around before you make your first purchase!0 comments1"

The only certainty is that it is impossible to be sure how the markets will move.The sharpest falls and the largest gains are often concentrated into short periods of time. If you try to time the market to avoid the falls, you’re highly likely to miss the gains.We agree that time in the market is the most important factor & from our research, we find that you should be invested for at least 10 years to ride out all the turbulence in the markets.0 comments0"
