question,"CPF Insurance Asked by Zen Rogue XuanAsked on 30 Jul 2019Should I cancel my CPF Dependant Protection Scheme (DPS) as I already have the Aviva Group Term Life (GTL) for MINDEF and MHA?I have done my calculations. The amount I am paying over the entire duration for CPF DPS, which gives me coverage of $46k, if channelled over into Aviva's GTL, will give me coverage of almost x5 times more at $220k. Also, CPF DPS only covers up till the age of 59, but Aviva's GTL stretches to age 65. Should I make this switch? Anybody with prior experiences to share?3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Joyce Chan, Senior Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 Jul 2019My personal take is that this is a super affordable insurance policy worth keeping. Moreover, this is a rare breed of insurance that is payable via your CPF. On its own, it is not sufficient and your Group Term policy serves as another layer of protection. You may wish to look into your personal term/whole life plans as well.

Best part: you can use CPF to pay for the premium. (aviva's group term only accept cash)The bad thing is we cannot buy more even if we want to.0 comments2"

You may wish to drop it and get private insurance as term premiums have progressively decreased, especially for death coverage.0 comments0"
