1,"Soon XiaohuiLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hello​Here's my thought: ​For algorithm trading - it helps to remove your emotional fears, and it helps you to stick to your trading strategies firmly.  ​but the downside is you must know how to code, it is not the usual programming language. It has little documentation on it. And before you start, you must have firm strategy & trading experience. ​​For manual trading - we may self sabotage our trades by gambling, not sticking to our own rules, forgotten to implement risk management into our trades, etc. And not to mentioned, we may not have time to look at the charts. ​But the adv is you may trade more profitable trades than algorithm trading as algorithm requires absolute conditions to enter or exit the market. ​Well even though algorithm trading is tough to code but what I can suggest is why don't you start from modifying some of the trading indicators to improve the accuracy of your trading strategy. 1 comment3"
