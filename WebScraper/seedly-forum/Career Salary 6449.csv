question,"Career Salary Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Nov 2018I want to leave my company after 2 years contract. My boss mentioned that I'll receive a promotion and pay raise after the 2 years. Should I tell him about my plans if I want to leave on a good note?Reason I want to leave is because I feel this job is very soul sucking and not meaningful, even though I am relatively good at it. I rather go for something more meaningful, even if it pays less4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Angeline TeoLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 17 Apr 2019Hi there, my advice would be not to inform your boss first. The reason is because there are many things that would change in the span of two years. This includes: your job, your boss and your perception of what you are doing now. In the span of two years or twenty four months, there is a probability your company will go through restructuring, your boss might be promoted or move to another department, your role might change, your perception of your role might also improve.Rather another way to think through it would be to find people you can talk to that are doing jobs you perceive are meaningful and not soul-sucking. Hear what they have to say, and consider what it is about the job that is soul-sucking. Then keep moving in that positive direction. :)0 comments1"

In some cases, some bosses who hate staff quitting on them will tend to give their staff a bad time. This can range from giving you extra work load before you leave, or down to snarky comments. However, if your boss is a good one, and cares about your personal growth + values you as a team member, then it makes sense to have a 1 on 1 talk with him on your career goals, what counts as meaningful to you, how your skills can contribute towards the wider company goals etc. For all you know, it might lead to better things!0 comments0"

Is there another department in the company that would be able to give you the “meaning” you are searching for? If yes, maybe negotiate an internal transfer. From the organisation standpoint it’s good to have an employee understand various parts of the business.But if there’s no such opportunity, then by all means go. Don’t need to tell until you’ve found that other job that you like. You can get promoted after the 2 years, then leave a few months later with that higher job grade to help you command higher salary elsewhere.0 comments0"
4,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019No, you shouldnt tell him. Even better if u can leave after u get a promotion, that will make your resume look nice (better title and higher base starting salary). Many bosses makes empty promises, so dont put your hopes too high too. Anyway 2 years is a long time, alot things still can change by then. Just focus on now. Is there anyway to improve on your current work condition? Or is there any meaningful things u can do? Eg do u have any ideas or project u can suggest to your boss? 2 comments0"
5,"Question Poster16 Nov 2018Actually I'm left with a few more months.. My boss did mention that the jobscope will be more or less the same though. Yixiong Chang16 Nov 2018Then probably u can wait for your promotion and start updating your resume/linkedln. But if u do not see the promotion coming, u can probably leave whenever u can/want to. If u do get a promotion, stay on for at least 6months to a year before leaving. This will be good for your next step forward. (Of course, unless u can a very good offer before that)"
