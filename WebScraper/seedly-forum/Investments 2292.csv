1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Not neccessarily, a stock's performance should be based on the fundamentals affecting the business at the end of the day. If the business is not performing well, stock prices will fall as per the value of the business.In many instances, the trading share price of the firm and the intinsic value of the firm may be different, but I believe that by and large the share price will soon reflect the fundamentals of the firm. In some scenarios such as bubbles, the speculative share prices of the firm may be way higher than how much the share is really worth. But like all bubbles, they eventually burst, and the share prices will crash to reflect the extended overvaluation.0 comments0"
