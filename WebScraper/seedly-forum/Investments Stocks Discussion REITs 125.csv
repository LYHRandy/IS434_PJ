MasterAnswered on 04 Jul 2019Just take the number of units of Ascott offered multiply it by the current share price of Ascott, minus cash given and then divide it by the number of units of Ascott offeredi.e.  if you have 1000 AHT shares1000 AHT x 0.0543 = $54.30794 AHBT * $1.30 = $1032.20$1032.20 - $54.30 = $977.9$977.9 / 794 = $1.23Thus, if Ascott falls below $1.23, it'd be more worth it to sell off your AHT shares in the market0 comments0"
