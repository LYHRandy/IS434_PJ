1,Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Just get hospitalisation insurance (integrated shield plan). You can use your medisave to pay part of it. Upgrade to the tier that u can best afford.4 comments1
2,"See all 4 comments Question Poster04 Apr 2019Yes that's my point exactly. thank you for reaffirming that. Just wondering, how important is the rider, and what happens if I dont get the rider option? It means there is no 5% or 10% copayment?Yixiong Chang05 Apr 2019If u don't get the rider, u will have to pay the deductible($3500 for private/A etc)  and a co-pay 10% of the remaining. You might want to add me on fb to discuss instead."
3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019H&S insurance will never go wrong (aka shield plans or ISP in Singapore).Its medisave payable, and helps to prevent bills bursting over a limit. Be it for public or private hospital, best to upgrade to the one you can afford. If cost is an issue, even the standard plan is good. Medishield life is very inadequate for 10% of bills that exceed medishield life claim limit.5 comments0"
4,"See all 5 comments Question Poster18 Apr 2019Oh yes, and there doesn't seem to be much info on the amt of premiums to be paid, unless I missed it out. HmmLoh Tat Tian19 Apr 2019For premium, do contact one of your ntuc agents to find out. It should be cheaper than CI plans definitely."

7,"Guo Hao Teo, Self-Taught Enthusiast at Personal FinanceLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019H&S would make the most sense at this junction.. naturally premiums now would be higher.But also please hold on to that PA plan for as long as possible as accidents do happen at this age.Another thing I would advise you to do is to save up a bunch of capital and create a larger rainy day fund cos she may need it when the time comes.3 comments0"
