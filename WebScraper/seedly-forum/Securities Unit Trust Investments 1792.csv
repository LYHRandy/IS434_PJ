God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Apr 2019If you want specifically technology exposure than why not. It's not should or shouldn't invest, its how much of your overall portfolio is exposed to tech equities. Every asset class and industry can have space in your portfolio. If you're worried about short term volatility and loss of capital, then maybe not so much.0 comments1"
