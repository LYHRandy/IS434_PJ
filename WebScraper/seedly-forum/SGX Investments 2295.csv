1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Growth companies wise, itâ€™s much better to look at Bursa or HKEX in the region. SGX is still relevant for Singaporeans since prices are denominated in SGD without running currency risk. REITs and select blue chips are still giving good dividends.0 comments0"
