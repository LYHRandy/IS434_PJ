1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Jan 2019Have been using them for a number of years now. Nowadays I'd transfer funds over using dbs as it's free and relatively fast. Funds transferred in the afternoon can be reflected around midnight. Only tried withdrawal once a few years ago, fee of about 10 or 25 usd involved. Not sure of the time needed to receive funds. Risk wise, don't think there's any, else my entire community would be in an uproar as we use them exclusively for the lowest comms here. 0 comments1"
