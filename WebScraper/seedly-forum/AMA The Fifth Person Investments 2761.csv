1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019I think it's quite common to see that investors are less willing to sell their stock and cut losses when the current price is way lower than the acquisition price. More than the paper loss, I feel that the time and effort spent is a greater factor in the sunk cost bias. The more time spent researching the industry and the business, the greater the confidence in the decision to buy or not buy the stock. I think one way to avoid sunk cost bias is to pick spots you're competent in. Learn about a few industries and the businesses under these industries. For myself, if I don't think I have the time or ability to get up to date with the industry condition and business in time to make a buy decision, I don't bother risking and taking a chance. 0 comments1"
