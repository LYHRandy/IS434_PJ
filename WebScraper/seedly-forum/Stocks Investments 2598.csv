1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 27 Feb 2019I guess before you start doing the valuation, it would be good if you could also look at what is the cause of the negative earnings, such as whether the negative earnings are caused by short or long term events, cyclical such as in the semiconductor industry, and whether they are fim-specific or industry specific.For companies that are in the early stage of growth (and therefore may have negative earnings), multiples of enterprise value (ev) / revenue. price / sales may also be used when tech companies ipo. Industry specific multiples like ev / users or ev / ebitdar (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent) could be adopted in some instances as well depending on the significance of the metric in the industry. However, i guess the issue here would be whether or not the companies are proper comparables or not in the first place.i think that understanding the reasons for the negative earnings would help decide what metrics to use a lot more easily.0 comments1"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Feb 2019I would assume you are looking at a company which is still cashflow negative but growing at double digits and eventually will be profitable.Isaac has brought up plenty of possible metrics you could use. Personally it depends on the industry the company is in- though i am guessing the sector would most likely be tech or pharma related. Tech wise- look at the business model of the company and its competitors in the industry. Focus on the metrics investors are largely concerned with. look at the lifetime value (ltv) its users/customers, estimated years till the business turns profitable, its top line and bottom line scalability and offerings. Benchmarking will be tricky- usually it will be hard to find very comparable companies especially since its probably working with some unique business model or product innovation. But following buffet and fisher's teachings- it should be a screaming buy for you to decide to invest in it.0 comments0"

GeniusAnswered on 27 Feb 2019First question to ask is if the company has negative earnings, do you still want to put your money in a company that is not doing well?Second question is since the earnings is negative, do you think it will become positive in the future? If you are not sure about it, then you shouldn't waste time on valuing this company0 comments0"
