1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Well, it depends on one's needs. If a person has a very low risk appetite, likes to have ""forced"" savings and prefers a form of guaranteed returns, endowments would be suitable.​Other than that, personally I don't really like endowments due to the long lock up period, medicore returns, and lost opportunity cost if I were to channel the funds towards my own portfolio instead.2 comments1"
2,"Esther Esther13 Feb 2019May i know medicore returns would be about how many percent returns?Jonathan Chia Guangrong13 Feb 2019My income floor portfolio is yielding about 5-6+% onwards, while my income ceiling portfolio is 10x that. I'll consider anything below my income floor portfolio yield to be mediocre. But this is my individual perception of what good yields can be like. "

MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018It's because it locks in your money for quite a long period while only providing low returns so many people feel that there are much better alternatives with better returns such as SSB or short term FD which provides flexibility for your to withdraw your funds anytime as well 0 comments1

6,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 06 Dec 2018Endowment plans are like savings plan that can help towards your retirement goals. However, you need to commit to a number of years and you may even get back lesser money compared to what you have put in if you withdraw earlier. I would personally prefer Singapore Saving Bond where you can withdraw anytime without any penalties.0 comments0"

If you can mange your own money and have investing knowledge, I think its better for you to DIY. End of the day you'll learn when you lose cash. And then apply past lessons to future lessons. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Most are already covered by the 6 answers here.​In Endowment, the money you take back might be lesser then the total premium paid when the mature date happens to be a down market.​The pay out does not factor in inflation if any.​The insurance coverage is 101% to 105%.​IF ""retirement"" ""education"" fund is the plans for the endowment plans, I would recommend CPF contribution rather then Endowment Plan.​I will not go indepth into CPF here since you can search from seedly.sg, so do give it a thought and read up on CFP.​Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you. ​​0 comments0"
9,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Actually I've personally benefited from endowment plans. In insurance, people rarely share their benefits publicly because it invites gossip, but I am doing that so that others who have not benefited know how it can help.​So I have an endowment plan with flexible withdrawal allowance (or cashback, coupons, whatever you call these). I started the plan when I was in NS and it helped me on two occassions - first when I have exhausted all my savings after NS and uni, and I couldn't find work when I graduated in late 2009. Secondly, the plan helped me again when I changed jobs late on, as there was cashflow issues. I'm not a very disciplined saver, but having this endowment plan has helped me to set aside money to save when I needed it the most - I don't have to borrow from family or friends, or incur interest getting personal loans from banks. ​And as for retirement planning, you may want to ask how much you want for retirement. If you think less than $1,000/month is sufficient, there's already CPF LIFE in place. Just be sure that you're hitting the Full Retirement Sum when the time comes (no Basic Retirement, Full Retirement is needed). Though I must emphasise $1,000/monthly is hardly enough these days.​Otherwise, endowment plans will help you set money aside for later use - can have one of these three types:1) Provide a lump sum payment at certain age (Traditional Endowment Plans)2) Provide regular payouts after a certain age (Annuities)3) Provide flexibility for withdrawals (Whole Life Endowment Plans - these products are relatively new in the market, e.g. PruWealth)​Can choose which one you like and how much to put in base on what you need.0 comments0"
10,"Loh Tat Tian, Complex Manager at Ocean Ifm Pte LtdLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Endowments are basically long terms savings plan. They are catered for a specific savings goal (like within 10-15 years), where you will definitely need that amount of money.The reasons why they are bashed is as follows
1) Most endowment can only achieve a 2.45% in the current projectment.
2) They have long holding period (illiquid)
3) There are better places to put them (like SSB which has almost 0 holding period, but the 2.45% is gauranteed if you hold them). 
4) No penalty also to withdraw in the case of emergency, unlike endowments. It gives a lot of flexibility.For retirement planning, as you have a very long horizon, it's better to put it in a higher risk, higher return as the risk will likely average out for a more decent return of 4% and above.
Of course, the risk appetite is not for everyone.Also, if you are able to hit FRS, it will be wise to top up your CPF SA (especially if you are hitting 55 in a couple of years), since the 4% is gauranteed in this few years, and you can withdraw amount higher than FRS.0 comments0"
