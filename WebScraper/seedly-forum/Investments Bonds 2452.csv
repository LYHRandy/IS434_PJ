1,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Hello! Whether it is a good time to buy a bond is not determined solely on whether it is being sold at a premium.  There are other factors that would affect whether you would want to buy the bond such as the expectation of interest rates a well as the credit worthiness of the bond itself. Hope this helps!0 comments0
