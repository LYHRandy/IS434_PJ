1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Feb 2019One key takeaway from the letter is Buffett's plans for more share repurchases, that ""will take place at prices above book value but below our estimates of intrinsic value"". This is interesting as Buffett is brushing aside politicians' attack on shares buyback. A week earlier, senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders said they will penalize ""self-indulgent"" corporations that buy back their own stocks, limiting the ability of companies to buyback shares. 0 comments2"
