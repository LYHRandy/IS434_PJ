1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Mar 2019Hedge fund is a pooled investment structure set up by a money manager or registered investment advistor. The pooled investment structure is either a limited partnership or limited liability company. Hedge funds like mutual funds are pool of underlying securities. The hedge fund is operated by a manager who invests money into different assets to achieve the fund's goal. Depending on the objectives or goals, managers will adopt different strategies such as invest in ""lony only"" equities etc. Generally, hedge funds aim to make money despite the market fluctuations. In other words, hedge fund managers are similar to traders.Hedge funds are usually only available to accreditated investors unlike ETFs that are available to all investors.0 comments1"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Hedge funds, like what Sandra has mentioned, require you to be an accredited investor, meaning that not any retail investor with 10k in his pocket can choose to invest in them. You have to be a high net worth investor! As to if they are better or not, it depends on your investment goals. Assuming lets say you get a windfall of 10 million dollars right now, and you have met the criterias of being an accredited investor, AND you are looking for an aggressive fund that takes highly leveraged positions by dealing with derivatives (instruments whose value is determined by the underlying stock/bond eg. options, swaps) and shorting for potential high returns, then I guess they are a better fit for your investment goal. However, I'm taking a guess that you don't exactly fit that criteria at this moment. But don't worry! mutual funds and etfs have much lower barriers to entry, and you still can search for an aggressive mutual fund, just no where close to that of a hedge fund, in order to fulfil your high returns goal. I'm no where at that level to be able to invest in a hedge fund either, and I may never be, but the most important thing is that we know what our investment goals are, and how much risk are we willing to take! understanding oneself is the first step in becoming a successful investor, no matter if you invest in just etfs, bonds, mutual funds, or hedge!0 comments0"
