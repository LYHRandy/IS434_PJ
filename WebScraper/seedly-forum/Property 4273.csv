2,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Jun 2019If same size and age, I would prefer buying resale bto over resale DBSS. Given all the negative news regarding DBSS, I would also pick EC over DBSS if I have sufficient funds. I only have to wait another 5years for the EC to be private but DBSS is just HDB with “premium” features.0 comments0"
