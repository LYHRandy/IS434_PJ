3,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 May 2019I agree with Gabriel. I think that cash dividend is better than stock as right now I'm stuck with some odd lots and I do not know how do I dispose off it.0 comments0"
4,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would choose cash. Because I want to avoid the odd lots for my stocks most of the time. However, if the scrip dividend is given at a very good discount, I opt for it.Odd lots are hard to sell in the market.1 comment0"
5,Siow Nan28 May 2019Chose scrips for my srs Long term investments and main cash for my cash investments. No right or wrong. Might be costlier to get broker to sell off odd lots but you do also save on “reinvestment” fees if u opt for cash then invest in again.
