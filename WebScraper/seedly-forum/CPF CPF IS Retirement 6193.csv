question,"CPF CPF IS Retirement Asked by Kenneth LouAsked on 24 Apr 2019What do you think of the CPF? What improvements do you think you would like to see in the near future?We're meeting the CPF team next week and we are keen to give them some feedback on how it can be improved as well. I just wrote a piece on CPF vs other pension schemes in the world, and I'm curious to understand the community's thoughts on CPF in Singapore!10 answersAnswerBump3"

1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Limits on property purchase. Higher Medisave withdrawal limits for insurance and bills across all ages.Other pension schemes around the world are sometimes only for the social security or the CPF Life part. Not many use our 3 account system for housing needs, retirement needs, and medical needs.I think that our CPF needs to be more segregated from each other. People don't understand that Medisave amount cannot take out, and say their CPF got a lot of money when it's all just Medisave. Quite a lot of lack of education. And I can't wait for RSS to be phased out permanently and for everyone to be on CPF life. Less headache as well.1 comment4"

3,"Goh Kah Kiat, Editor-in-chief at Risknreturns.comLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The main issue I have with CPF is the CPFIS scheme. Some reforms have been implemented but more can be done.Cost prohibitive to have a diversified portfolio of stocks (especially if your positions are small) due to quarterly $2.14 charge per counter. Having 10 stocks = $85.60 per annum. I understand these are bank fees and CPF may not be able to influence them, but one can try.Limit amount you can use to buy Unit Trusts, ILPs, Annuities and Endowments. Having no limits on those products make no sense when most of these products underperform Index funds. It also encourages predatory financial advisors to recklessly sell these products to customers as “you can’t touch this money anyway”3 comments3"
4,"See all 3 comments Goh Kah Kiat25 Apr 2019Https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/CPFISInvestmentProducts.pdf This document seems to contradict the point on annuities and endowments. Anyway, I get that stocks are risky to the uninitiated. Which is why I understand why there are limits on stocks and I'm not arguing for a lift on the limit. I'm more arguing from the point of view that ILPs and Unit Trusts should have limits too as they are risky products (they are essentially equities too if you buy a equity fund). Just because there are so-called experts managing those products doesn't make them risk free.Hariz Arthur Maloy25 Apr 2019A long time ago you could buy endowment and annuities. Not anymore for a number of years now. Currently you have to leave behind 20k in OA and 40k in SA before investing. I would agree to not allow SA investment but only OA. And yes they aren't risk free, but they are less risky."
5,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Apr 2019A lot of people are not clear what Medisave could be used for. There also seems to be a lot of restrictions with regards to the usage of Medisave. At the same time, the BHS (Basic Healthcare Sum) is increasing every year. Perhaps more education in this area could be provided to the public.  Just a suggestion.0 comments1"
6,"Mypetrescue GivelifeLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 6h agoI am 62 and my wife is 60 this year. We are fortunate to be able to accumulate both our RA to ERS and will be drawing down from age 65. If I passes on before my wife or her before me, my suggestion is for CPF to allow the remaining balances in our RA account to be transferred to the surving spouse's account, instead of a payout in cash to prevent the elderly to money scams, investments etc. An enhanced nomination has its limitations as you are well aware.0 comments0"
7,"Shirley TayLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 8h agoMedisave acct - for those with no chronic history and hardly touch Medisave , makes no sense to keep increasing amt and retiree can't touch when still alive. Esp if person has no dependents to bequeath to. Whole cpf system is overly complicated. Suggest revert to primary objective of funding retirement need and maybe plus one secondary area eg housing or health etc (depending on members choice). Can't have everything. From age 65, calculate monthly payouts based on max 20 yrs duration. More meaningful to live a better quality of life when retiree still mobile. No point leaving hardearned $$$ behind when gone.0 comments0"
8,"Min Shun HsuLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 29 Apr 2019Hello there,
Regarding CPF Vs other provident fund. One main difference is with regards to expats requirement to contribute to the fund. It should be mandatory for employer that for all employees local or non citizen should be required to make such contribution.Example if a job opening that has a budget of 5000.
The company can hire a local at 4200 or an expat at 5000. This is the discrepancy when such provident rate is not applied across the board. Meaning 37% of the CPF is technically contributed by local and PR due to the long run effect of the scheme.Employers should be required to contribute employer's portion regardless of citizenship. This will make hiring consideration more fair and just. 
Other countries likely require expats to contribute.I hope this issue can be raise for discussion as it affects almost all PMETs and fellow Singaporeans during hiring considerationThanks0 comments0"
9,"Wong YixiangLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Upon turning 55, RA will be created and savings from SA will be transferred to RA first, followed by OA if there’s insufficient fund in SA.May I suggest that CPF Board gives members a choice to decide if they want to transfer their monies in OA to RA first (before SA)? This is because CPF members aren’t allowed to top up SA through Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme (RSTU) after 55 and many of us prefer to preserve our savings in SA so as to earn higher interest. Thank you.1 comment0"
10,Hariz Arthur Maloy26 Apr 2019Haha cannot la. It's meant so that govt don't have to give so much interest. You can shield your SA however using CPFIS before 55.
11,"Jeff WongLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 26 Apr 2019I am a retiree, age 72 yes. I enjoyed a mthly withdrawal from CPF retirement a/c for our daily household living expenses.  I've chronic illnesses  and is prescribed medications from our NHS  polyclinics for hypertension and stroke medications. These medications plus consultations comes to avg S$120.00/mth.  However, MOH, will allow  a withdrawal of ONLY $700.00 max per year.  At this rate my current Medisave a/c bal can sustain the my withdrawal for another 50+ yrs ( IE, I'll be 120+ yrs old). I had asked CPF Board as well as MOH officers responsible for the Medisave a/c  to allow for an increase in my Medisave a/c withdrawal for payment of my medications but was rejected. Hence, I had to reduce my cash expenditures to offset the max Medisave limit allowed for withdrawal for my chronic illnesses medications. With such a policy, I am sure to leave a sum of Medisave fund on my demise when my need for it is denied now.  There are many netizens in similar circumstances.  I hope to see a fair withdrawal limit, IE, l in relation to fund available in Medisave a/c and notban arbitrary amount applicable to every member a/c balances.0 comments0"
12,Jacinda SiewLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019How much higher can we have the interest rate go? How did this rate get computed? Why up to 5%?Can we lift the $7k cap annually for tax relief when transferring OA to SA?2 comments0
13,"As Df25 Apr 2019There is no 7k cap on OA to SA transfer. I think you're confusing the maximum tax relief on cash top ups with transfers.Jacinda Siew26 Apr 2019You are right, my apologies for getting it wrong!
