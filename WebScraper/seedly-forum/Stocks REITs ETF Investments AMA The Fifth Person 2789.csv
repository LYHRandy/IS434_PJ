1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Feb 2019Hi,There are only 2 criterias that will make me sell the stock.Firstly, when the business fundamental change. For example, in the past SPH use to be a good dividend stocks but with the disruption of technology, the advertisement revenue of SPH is being affected by facebook and google. Secondly, the company valuation is super overvalued. For instance, Nestle Malaysia is a dividend type of company but their business is saturated already and they max out their growth potential but the company is trading at PE 54x which I think is crazy. If I am the shareholder of Nestle, I will definitely sell the stock now. 0 comments0"
