question,"Investments Robo-Advisors Bank Account Stocks Discussion Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Asked by Wilson ChuaAsked 2w agoUsing Personal Bank Account VS SRS to fund my RoboAdvisor account, which one is better?Hi, I have two questions in mind while opening my first RoboAdvisor account.Firstly, what are the pros and cons of using a personal bank account vs using an SRS account to fund the portfolio? I do not have an SRS account at the moment. Secondly, I have S$10k lump sum ready to invest and plan to DCA $500 monthly into my RoboAdvisor account. Is it sound to invest all in the lumpsum or would you advise to split (e.g. invest 5k now and the other 5k later)? Thank you in advance. :)1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi there Wilson,If you are using SRS to fund your robo-advisor account, should you liquidate, your funds will be returned to SRS. You will still have no access to it till 62 (discounting the 5% penalty, etc). Funding by cash is hence more 'liquid' as your liquidated proceeds go back to your bank account.
I would ask if there is a need to contribute SRS for yourself. If there is, then, by all means, open an SRS account online, and fund it, and then use the SRS monies to invest. If not, you might be better off keeping it in cash. If you'd like a bit more insight on SRS and whether it might suit you, I am actually conducting a seminar on this topic next week.On your strategy to do a $10K lump sum and DCA $500/mth, if that is all you have, then I would definitely suggest holding back a portion (how much is up to you) in order to act as a warchest when opportunities come knocking. However, if you have the capacity to rebuild your funds and your warchest even if you do a $10K lump sum and $500/mth RSP, then, by all means, go ahead and invest in that manner.One last thing, do consider your investment profile, risk appetite, time horizon, and with that, look at all the asset classes available so that you would be able to construct a well-balanced and risk-managed portfolio for yourself. You might want to speak with an independent advisor who can offer you multiple asset classes to understand the options for yourself before deciding.3 comments7"
