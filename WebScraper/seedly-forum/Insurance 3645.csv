2,"Alan KorLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 4w ago1) term insurance provides high coverage with low premiums. ideally, it will be good to lock in to 65. however, you can terminate at any time when there is no need for term insurance, ie no dependents.2) no difference from agents or online as the plan is from insurers itself. agents are not legally obligated to service you.Early ci is good to have but not necessary, due to the high cost of the premiums and low coverage.0 comments0"
3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2019It is not easy to answer this question. When you renew every 5 years, the
Rate of increase versus Time value of money will need to be calculated
The renewability of your health is also a factor.Once you have pre-existing, the renewal term may be ""non-renewable"". So you got to understand the risk you are taking.For over 30, I would just lock in the rates (if buying up to 60/65), so as to free my mental energy on savings the premiums (term is really cheap, that it doesn't warrant much comparison time).0 comments0"

RookieAnswered on 20 Sep 2019Is it wiser to lock in the premium rate or take a chance at renewing my premium rate every 5 years?If you buy 5 years renewable term, the premium for the start is cheaper then a term covered for 20 years or up to 65. However, for the renewable term, at every renewal, ur cost of insurance will increase and based on your age of ur new renewal term. Most importantly u need it for what purpose. If you know you want it to protect ur prime working year then u should get longer-term coverage to prevent the increase of premium over the years.Is there any difference between getting a term from advisors or directly online? Some say getting online is cheaper. But if you know a good & responsible advisor, u can consider getting from them cos is always good to have someone u trust to manage ur policy. Even if you have a question, u can directly ask them instead of having the trouble calling up CS and CS might not get you the answer you want.Is it necessary to add Early CI coverage? Individual preference. In term of premium, it will be more expensive than a CI covering Advanced conditions. But in term of claim, early CI might have a higher chance of claim. Most importantly you must have will be a health & surgical (hospital) insurance to cover your hospital bill.Based on your age, the premium for a term till 65 is quite cheap even with CI. Speak to someone you are comfortable with to find out which coverage best suits you.0 comments0"
