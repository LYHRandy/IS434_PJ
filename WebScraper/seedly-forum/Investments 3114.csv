question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Nov 2018If I transfer bonds (let's say a retail corp. bond) out to CDP, does that mean I can save on this 0.2% P.A and have the bonds under my name in CDP?Hi all,Good day. I am a beginner who just started using online brokers. I use FSMOne to look at bonds information and i will like to ask the following:FSM has ""0.05% per quarter, calculated on a daily average market value of bonds."" as flatform fees. So it will cost 0.2% P.A by storing the bonds i buy on FSM. If i do transfer the bonds (let's say a retail corp. bond) out to CDP, does that mean i can save on this 0.2% P.A and have the bonds under my name in CDP?Thanks in advance,Vincent1 answerAnswerBump0"
