If you are doing only $1000 a month, it can still be cheaper in IB despite the $10 monthly fee by IB, if your stock is bought in overseas currency. This is because IB's forex rate is hugely cheaper than Standard Chartered Bank or any other banks. You're saving quite a big difference on the forex.Plus, not sure abt SCB, but most stockbrokers or banks charge fees for stock dividends management and other crap fees. Interactive Brokers does not.0 comments0"
