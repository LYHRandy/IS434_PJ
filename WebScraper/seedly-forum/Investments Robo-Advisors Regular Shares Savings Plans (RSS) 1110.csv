2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 May 2019You may wanna work out your investment objectives first. Do you want growth, or do you want income? Seems like you are going after growth at the moment based on your asset allocation, which is not wrong. But if you want to include other objectives or have much better returns then look to park your cash elsewhere.0 comments0"
3,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 May 2019If I were you, I will diversify into other holdings. From what I see, you are taking an ETF approach to do up your investments. If you would like to, you might spread the rest of the funds into instruments that give you a higher yield if you are seeking for dividend pay out. You might want to get into some bond fund or equity fund with a more strategic investment direction to seek for higher returns.0 comments0"
