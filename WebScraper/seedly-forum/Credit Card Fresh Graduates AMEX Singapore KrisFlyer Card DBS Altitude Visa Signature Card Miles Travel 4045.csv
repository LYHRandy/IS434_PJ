1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 06 Aug 2019Hi anon! I’m sure many fresh grads are planning which credit cards they should get and you’ve arrived at the right place! :) Here at Seedly, we’re all about making smarter financial decisions together and that’s what this summary of the top 5 most common miles credit card will do.TL;DR: The miles credit card that’s best for:Grab expenditure: AMEX KrisFlyerTravelling & overseas miles rate: DBS AltitudeLocal miles rate: UOB KrisFlyerMiles rate with partners: UOB PRIVIAdditional mile rewards: Citi PremierMilesHere’s a summarised table on the 5 miles credit cards (open in a new tab/zoom in to read the details!):Now let’s break down your expenditure:Transport: If most of your transportation expenditure is on Grab then the AMEX KrisFlyer Card would be ideal for you given the 3.3 miles rate. However, if you are likely to spend beyond S$200 each month on Grab then the cap imposed by AMEX KrisFlyer might not make it the best. The UOB KrisFlyer would be better in this case! If most of your transport expenditure is on public transport rides, then the UOB KrisFlyer Card would be ideal for you. The DBS Altitude’s 4 miles rate seems really attractive but bear in mind that it only lasts through the promotional period. Beyond that, these 2 cards would provide better rates.Dining & online shopping: The UOB KrisFlyer provides the best rates for your meals outside and online shopping.In a nutshell, the UOB KrisFlyer Card seems to be the best based on your monthly expenditure. The AMEX KrisFlyer Card would come to a close second place if majority of your transportation expenditure is on Grab. Of course, if the additional mile rewards is important to you then the Citi PremierMiles Card would come to a close second place too. But based on the fact that the majority of your expenditure is on local spend, the UOB KrisFlyer Card should be your choice.However, do note that the UOB KrisFlyer's 3 miles (local rate) is comprised of 1.2 mpd base rate + bonus 1.8 mpd. This bonus will only be credited 2 months after the card membership year which is quite a bit of a wait. So do take note about this point if you're considering the card despite its pretty good miles rate!At the end of the day, please do your due diligence in researching about the cards and its features before getting one, especially if this is your first card as a fresh grad! Ensure the T&Cs are reasonable to you and matches your spending behaviour. I hope this was helpful for you! :-)3 comments4"
2,"See all 3 comments Elijah Lee06 Aug 2019Sarah, I have to chime in with my opinion, the 3mpd for UOB Krisflyer is comprised of both base spend and accelerated miles. However, the bonus 1.8 mpd on dining, online shopping, online travel and transport transactions will only be credited 2 months after the card membership year. We're looking at an agonizing long wait, and you'll probably have to go through the statements to ensure that the bonus miles post correctly. Milelion, Shutterwhale and MainlyMiles have weighted in on this 'feature' and it doesn't sit well with them (or with me).

3,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Aug 2019To me, there isn't a one card fits all for miles chasers. We own quite a number of cards for different categories. I am going to go ahead and recommend you the following:1) AMEX Ascend Card. Link here:  https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/credit-cards/singapore-airlines-krisflyer-ascend-credit-card/ 1.2 miles per dollars (mpd)miles goes straight to your Krisflyer account3.2 mpd for Grab rides and a few lifestyle merchant (starbucks, foodpanda etc)Lounge accessAMEX has awesome customer service. LOLThe other 2 cards are for ""buying miles"" - DBS Altitude Card and Citi PremierMiles. Pay their annual fee and get 10,000 miles. Best of all, the points don't expire until you transfer over them to Krisflyer. Occasionally they run a few promotions here and there so that helps in accumulating miles faster. But if you can only choose 1, get the DBS Altitude Card. Gives you more miles when paying for air tickets and hotels (even Airbnb) over Citi PremierMiles.0 comments2"

if you got a DBS multiplier acc then It would make sense to get the Altitude card. The Combo would help your acc earn higher int rates
if you got OCBC then it might make more sense to get the titanium cardbasically look at which bank you want to build a relationship with0 comments1"
5,"MMarkLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 01 Aug 2019DBS Altitude Card. They have 4 miles per dollar (mpd) spend on transport till end of the year. Remember to register 
https://www.dbs.com.sg/Contact/dbs/cards/altitude-4mpd-promotion/default.page I like this card as it gives 
4 mpd for booking of SQ flights via DBS Marketplace
3 mpd for online flight or hotel booking And the best feature is of course miles never expire (though airlines will devalue)0 comments1"
