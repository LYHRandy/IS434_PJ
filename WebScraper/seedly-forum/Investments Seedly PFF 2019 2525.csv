2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019Most investment brokerages in Singapore have rather competitive prices per trade, at around $25. From my knowledge SAXO capital per trade is currently the lowest at about $8 - $15 per trade, depending on the trade value, followed by Standard Chartered at $10. Take note such brokerages that cost cheaper per trade like Standard Chartered and SAXO do not hold shares in a CDP account, but instead in their own custodian account, meaning that you don't possess voting rights, but if you are a small retail investor that don't really have so much shares in the first place it doesn't really matter.All in all, you can choose almost any brokerage since they are all quite competitive, other than a few fee differences here and there.0 comments0"
