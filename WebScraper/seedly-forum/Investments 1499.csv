1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Apr 2019I cannot attest to the funds performance but there is one main attractive point.Lower barrier to entry. Minimum monthly contribution is a mere $50!! That is really low barrier for almost everyone. Endowus which also uses Dimensional funds require an upfront $10k.0 comments1"
2,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 24 Apr 2019MoneyOwl uses funds provided by Dimensional Fund Advisors to manage clients monies. The fund expense ratio is about 0.35%. MoneyOwl charges a advisory fee of 0.65% pa (promo of 0.5%) for their launch. They use iFast as the platform fee. This is an extra 0.18% pa.Check out Investmentmoats article on ""Should I invest in DFA funds"" for a breakdown. Similarly, other Independent FAs may also distribute DFA funds and EndowUs is another provider of the same funds but uses PIMCO for the bond portion of the portfolio.0 comments1"
