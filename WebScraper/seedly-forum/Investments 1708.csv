God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Apr 2019These 2 are very very different and quite impossible to compare fairly.Gold is a commodity, it has natural value stored to it. It has typically been a way to adjust against inflation.Watches have value only because someone else is willing to pay for it at a price. It's an open market thing. Similar to art and other alternative investments.Inherently a painting has no value. It's purely demand and supply based. Not saying its a good or bad things. Just that can't compare between the two.0 comments0"
