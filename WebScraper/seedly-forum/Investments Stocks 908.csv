1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 29 Jun 2019Now that's a nice thought! I would re-invest 40% to 50% back into the stock market, put 40% to other asset classes and also scout around to look for high rental yield property. Would also allocate a portion to self learning and improvement.0 comments1"

MasterUpdated on 29 Jun 2019It depends on my age and earning that 1mil wasn't just pure luck.At my age, i'll re-invest that 1mil back into the stock market to generate more returns.If i'm 40s, i'll still re-invest but will diversify into different asset classes that are of lower risk.If i'm at retirement age, i'll leave a little in the stock market, majority in high interest savings account or short-term bonds.0 comments0"
