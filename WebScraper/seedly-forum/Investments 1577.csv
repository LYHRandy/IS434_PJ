MasterAnswered on 19 Apr 2019There is much consensus currently that we are in the late stage, not peak stage, of the business cycle, and I think the reasons are as below (my opinion at least)Dovish Fed: The Fed isn't exactly looking to tighten monetary policy, nor is it looking to cut interest rates. They seem to be exactly fine where they are currently. Initially they were quite hawkish with the whole Fed rate hike in 2018, but have cooled off considerably in the past few months. This means that either A) They realised this level is just nice to combat running inflation and have a sustainable growth rate B) current rates are still quite high, and they want to cut, but are afraid to do so because of the implications. Why Fed rates are so important is because the world sees it as a benchmark lending rate: if lending is made more expensive, this is because the economy is expanding too quickly, and they are pulling back the reins before the whole economy experiences too much inflation. If lending is made cheaper, they are trying to boost growth because there is alot of slack. Theoretically, a cut most likely signals a change in outlook to bearish since there is enough slack in the economy to want to boost production again.Decent growth by China and US: The wage and production figures recently released about China and the US are quite good - in fact above target. This means that there is still quite good optimism about growth and good opportunities to do so, leading to better numbers overall. If the economy was at it's peak, we wouldn't be seeing such above target numbers, but should be seeing gradual declines to steep declines once recession hits. These 2 major economies are good indicators of the overall health of the global economy, and since it still doesn't seem like it is slowing down drastically, there is still space for growth.These are just some factors that I could think of that lead to the conclusion we are in the late cycle. Given that there is still evidence of growth opportunities, it is too hasty to assume we are in the peak of the cycle. Major banks like JP Morgan have warned about a potential recession in 2020 given the end of several government stimulus packages and with the entire trade war dispute dragging on with Japan and US's coming into the fray, it would be good to prepar contingency plans regarding possible recession in the future.0 comments2"
