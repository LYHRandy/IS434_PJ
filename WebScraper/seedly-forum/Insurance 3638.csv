question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked 3w agoWhat does the complimentary health screening under PruLady cover?Hi ladies, does anyone mind sharing a little bit more about the preventive health screening? I've gotten my PruLady coverage a little over a year ago, and I should be eligible for the health screening next year. Just wondering if it covers tests like Pap Smears or mammograms? Or do they only provide the basic tests for free and we have to top up to do the above tests?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Ming AnnLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 3w agoHello,You will be getting a voucher for medical screening next year and you can go to the list of appointed clinics/hospital to do your checkup.Depending on which plan of PruLady that you purchased (A/B/C/D), then you will be doing a specific list of tests. There is no top-up option available for doing any additional test.The health screening generally covers your basic test (blood, vision, urine, breast self-examination, pap smear) and also some screening test for your organs and then you will get your medical report and doctor consultation.If your plan under Prulady is Plan C or D, then you will have an additional 2 test under the package which is breast mammogram and pelvic ultrasound.Hope it answers your question =)If you need any help do let me know, I will do my best to answer your questions as I am a consultant under Prudential2 comments5"
