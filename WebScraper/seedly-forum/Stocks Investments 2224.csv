question,"Stocks Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Mar 2019NVDIA outbidded Intel for Mellanox at 6bil. Just curious, how does the immediate decreased cash for NVDIA factor against the possibility of future gains from such acquisitions?Have seen many cases whereby price drops immediately after acquisitions using cash. Seems to me holding somewhat unproductive cash balance is valued by investors.1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 14 Mar 2019In this case, this news was a huge positive for NVDIA given it was being hit by a slew of downgraded expectations in the year ahead amidst stiff competition from AMD, intel and the decline of crypto mining hype.This big vertical acquisition gives NVDIA stronger networking effects in the High Powered Computer(HPC) market- allowing it to better serve data centers, as well as improved access to overseas markets such as Israel.NVDIA rallied ytd with over $10 dollar increase from 150 to 160 representing a 7% increase in stock valuation. However let us not forget the bigger the acquisiton, the greater the potential returns, but at the same time, the difficulties of a successful merger and integration scale as well. But going back to your main question, it is hard to foresee at this juncture specifically how much NVDIA's growth will be from this and whether there is still momentum from this news.0 comments0"
