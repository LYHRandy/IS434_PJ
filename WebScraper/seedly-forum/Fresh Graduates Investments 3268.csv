1,"HC TangLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Oct 2018Actually they are very different.1) SSB is low risk and works more like a long term savings of more than 2% interest2) STI ETF is an ETF of the top 30 bluechips stocks by market cap in SG. It is an equity invesment. ​Instead of just the 2, recommend to read this starting guide by Seedly, which has a better balance approach for starters: ​https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-easiest-ways-to-invest-a-monthly-sum-for-beginners/​Happy Investing :) 0 comments1"
