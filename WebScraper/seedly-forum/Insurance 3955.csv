question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Jan 2019What are your thoughts on AIA Pro Lifetime Protector?Agent mentioned that this plan blends life insurance and Early CI coverage, along with ILP portion, which I am currently putting at the Balanced tier. Annual premium is $4200 ($350/mth), adjustable due to flexibility of taking a premium holiday. E.g. Higher annual premium = Longer premium holiday. Sum assured for Death: $250kSum assured for CI: $200k (2x claim)Also able to withdraw profits from portfolio earnings.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jan 2019How long do you need the Early CI coverage. What is our use of the Early CI coverage? Do you know how much the premiums are as compared to the coverage?Are you willing to ride out the risk at the later part of your life and use investment (self-insure) instead to cover the Early CI coverage?For Life insurance without CI coverage, its cheaper to pay a term insurance and not be bogged down by the fees required to pay for the coverage (unless you are looking at a term insurance of not more than 20 years). Do you know the fees that is paid to the plan? How much of it is used to invest and how much is distributed cost? Are you willing to accept the high fees initially so that you may gain some bonus allocation from year 8 onwards? Does it make sense to you?I do agree with brandan on the use of whole life and term insurance (though whole life can be more expensive than ILP).0 comments0"
2,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Jan 2019As a financial planner myself, I would prefer to keep Investments separate from insurance. During the pitching, it may seem as though you had the best of both worlds through the combination of protection + investment, but numbers wise, it is really not the best way to achieve both protection and investment.Depending on your age, a cost efficient method may be to cover early stage critical illnesses with a Whole Life Plan, while Late Stage CI and Death/TPD using a Term plan. Alternatively, you may also combine a Multiclaim CI plan together with the Term plan.If you would like to know more in detail, feel free to reach out to me at brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg0 comments0"
