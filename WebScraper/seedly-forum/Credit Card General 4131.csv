2,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 22 May 2019That would be great. I believe I read something about that in dollars and sense. Howerver, credit cards promo are always changing. I find it hard to keep track. I think it would be good to choose a credit card that you prefer (cash back, miles, rewards) and stick to it. It free up quite a bit on the mental space and I would use the rest of the time to search for investments to build up a portfolio that creates a passive source of income.0 comments3"
3,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 22 May 2019Credit card is quite a floating game, the promo, t&c kept changing. On and off there might be new promotion hence News kids on the block coming out that offer good deals that can be the new favourite, but often they don't last, usually less than a year like (CIMB Visa Signature 10% cash back and BOC Family card). What i think can be done is a few pointer on:1) Where to find the best deal when applying ?2) What to look out for when applying?3) How to manage the bills repayment ?4) How to mange between interest free installment and normal spending ?5) How to manage between local use and travel credit card ?6) How to beat the cash back game ?7) How to ensure we get free waiver of annual fee all the time ?etcI can share all of the above at the top of my mind if you wish to find out more etc.0 comments0"
