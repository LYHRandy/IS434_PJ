1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Feb 2019Hi,I don;t invest based on whether there is a trade war or not. I am more of a bottom up approach investor that focus on the business fundamental. If the trade war turn sour, I will capture the opportunity to invest in good companies.0 comments1"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Feb 2019With recent headlines on progression of discussion talks between US & China, the longstanding Trade War seems to be on a verge of concluding. Indeed, markets Sentiment is largely in line- evident in the recent stock rallies- with prices reinstating to early trade war levels.The trade war is hurting both parties. Logically, both countries seem keen on resolution. However following the news- there are in fact still large parts of terms undecided. While China has lifted tariffs on US Soybeans out of goodwill, the trade war is still far from resolution. The clock is ticking as U.S. tariffs on $200 billion in imports from China are set to rise to 25 percent from 10 percent if no deal is reached by March 1.Let us not forget Trump started this whole saga as a campaign promise of national pride, to reinstate the trade balance between US & China. Ultimately, I believe Trump's administration will not give way without some form of big win, one which will ultimately require the Xi administration to make some form of concessions. President Xi, also known for being strong willed- just might not do so.TLDR: While I am a bull as to trade war resolution in the LR, the short term bear case is pretty strong as well. Expect more drama and pushback of deadlines- I believe we will go beyond March 1st.0 comments0"
