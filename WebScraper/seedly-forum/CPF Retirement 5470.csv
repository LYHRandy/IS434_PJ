God of WisdomAnswered on 05 Jul 2019If your MA hits BHS, future MA contributions will be transfer to your SA instead, unless your SA is at the prevailing FRS, then it will be transfered to OA. This is assuming you are below 55.0 comments2"

Your Ma interest will flow to SA or OA if frs is hit, and you will find yourself falling short from the new bhs level in the next year..0 comments0"
