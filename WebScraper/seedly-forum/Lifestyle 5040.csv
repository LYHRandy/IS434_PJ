1,"Vicky FaithLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Was working part time in an F and B buffet restaurant and was the host for the night shift (host = the person at the entrance that talks to the customer and gives customer their seat number). It was a full house night where we have reservations of about 300 pax and theres indoor and outdoor seats. All customers who gets outdoor seats were informed prior during their reservation. Here comes a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids, non Singaporean, Chinese speaking. They tried their luck to get indoor seats but I really dont have any to offer. The mom starts to mumble things and say that I'm making things difficult for them. They went to their outdoor seats eventually. During the dinner, their two young kids (probably about 8 to 10 years old) kept running in the restaurant, especially in the indoor area.
After an hour of eating their buffet with quite a bit of food wastage  on their table, the mom came to me at the entrance of the restaurant. It was really peak hour at that point of time. Below is the conversation (translated to English): Customer: can you see that my children keeps running indoor? That means it will make more sense for us to sit indoor. Give us an indoor seat now. Me: I'm sorry, the indoor seats are fully reserved and not available. We have already informed you over the phone that your reservation will be outdoor seats
Customer: what do you mean by full? Those reserve and have not come ask them to sit outdoor instead. I came first. Me: I'm sorry, those customers have called way earlier to make reservation for indoor seats. Unfortunately, I cant switch them outdoor without their permission. However, if theres any last min cancellation or customers leaving early, I will switch you to indoor immediately. Customer: (started shouting)what kind of service is this? Do you know I'm the paying customer? Me: yes I know. Customer: looking at you, I'm sure you're uneducated. Me: I'm currently studying and this is my part time job. Customer: well, then you must be bad at studying to be working part time. Me: I'm studying hospitality, which is about service.Customer: your parents must be uneducated to have a child like you. Me: yup, they are uneducated but my service has nothing got to do with them. Customer: no wonder your service is so bad. After she done shouting, she left and continued eating at her outdoor seats. At that point of time, a lot of customers already surrounded us and watch the ""show"". None came to help me or defend me. I was probably 17 or 18 years old at that point of time. At the end, only one uncle came to me and say ""ignore her la"". After thar I continued smiling and serve the other customers queuing up to enter the restaurant. After 0.5 hours later, as what u promised, I found an indoor seat for them and approached them to switch their seats. They ended up saying ""oh, my child prefers outdoor now. Dont need to switch"". Woohoooooo. Best day of my life, I guess. Theres a lot more service moments I could share but this was one of the worst because my parents were scolded which I was kind of hurt emotionally. 3 comments5"
