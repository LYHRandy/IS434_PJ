1,"Cherie Julianne TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 May 2018You won‘t be affected If you have a rider till futher notice.If you intend to remain without a rider. Previously, a rider covers your co-insurance and deductibles and your entire hospital bill “as charged”.  Being without it, exposes you to at least 15% of your hospital bill.​You will be affected if you choose to add on a rider. If you choose to add a rider from 8 March 2018 to 31 March 2019, the co-payment feature will only take place from 1 April 2021.​The co-payment feature is at 5% of your hospital bill with a cap of ~$3000 with conditions depending on your insurer. ​Since you do not have a rider at the moment, you will not be affected much when you choose to change coy. Unless you’ve been hospitalised before or you have a pre-existing condition that your current integrated shield plan covers. If so, then you risk the new coy not insuring your existing condition. ​I hope this helps!! Don’t be rash in switching ISP, call the coy/ doctor to double confirm of your medical history if necessary. Get advice with your trusted financial advisor as well, if you don’t have one then ask everyone till you find someone truthworthy haha. 0 comments3"

Shield plans are very much not my thing.​To value add, I WILL say that the MOH announcement has spiced things up between the insurers. So you have AXA, which mai gei kiang last year with their overly cheap prices and now their prices are roughly  in line with the market. If you are ABLE to switch, there might be a good opportunity to do so now because all the insurers are rattled and nervous, and that makes their acceptances of policies rushed but its more of their problem than yours. ​Additionally, the minimum copayment for each company rider is different. Each company aimed to do at about $5000, but some companies like NTUC have managed to keep it at $3000 or below for the full private rider. Which means theree is a financial difference there that should be consideration for a switch MUST EMPHASIZE - only if you are easily eligible. Please get an FA to help you with this. ​So you can do a little compare ask Julianne to do it, I'd really rather not and see which one might be good going long term into the future. 0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 25 May 2018The recent MOH announcement would not affect those w/o riders​Before switching to another company, please note the followingYou are subjected to full underwriting. There is a waiting period before you are able to make a claim​I would suggest if you can afford, get the rider for your ISP - it is very affordable if you are earning a decent income. Medical bills can be very expensive. 0 comments0"
