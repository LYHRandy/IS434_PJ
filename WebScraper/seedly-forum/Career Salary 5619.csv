If so, that means you really like the job and it may be good to accept the job and wait for 1 year to negotiate an increase of the salary based on great performance. It is not uncommon for a staff to have a high pay rise.Unless the current salary is accept is waaaay below your standard level, then it may be better for you to craft a nice and polite email apologising.Craft it even better than what you did now, mentioning that you are so excited over joining the company and contributing that you have forgotten to look into the salary aspects. now that you have looked into it, you realised its way below what you can commend based on your capabilities.  :)Best of luck whatever you choose!0 comments0"
