Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoYou are better off having an Interactive Brokers send your SGD to them (they have a local Citibank account to accept FAST transfer via our SG bank accounts), then use their forex to exchange for USD, EUR, JPY etc.They are a professional broker for stocks, options, futures, etc. The forex rate is waaaay better than any stockbrokers I have seen and even better than a similar Revolut competitor I checked out a few weeks ago.Most importantly, the convenience of the SGD from an SG account to a local bank account, and using their platform to change to USD.Just do a google search for Interactive broker how to transfer SGD2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster4w agoThanks! do you have any idea on what the youth rates are like for IB? are they worth it? do you have to pay a yearly fee for letting them hold the stocks you bought? thanks!Cedric Jamie Soh4w agoThere is no youth rate. They are the lowest fee in the world, with or without ""youth rate"". Recently they introduced 0 fees for some trading products, and forced Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade to react too (to slash to $0 for those products) 
IB has a $10 minimum trading fee per month charge. So if u trade and incurred $7 for the month, they will add another $3 fee to round it up.
Even at $120, thats not if you invested like $10k or $20k of stocks, the forex rate saving is great."
