God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Sep 2019I would be cautious when using SRS monies to purchase REITS, as you might face a situation where you have used up your SRS funds, done your top-up for the year, and a rights issue occurs and you are unable to subscribe due to insufficient funds.Stocks wise, you can consider POEMS where you will have access to other asset classes other than stocks, such as UT and ETF.0 comments5"
