1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018This question is a little broad, because even in Finance there are different areas as well. Also, I think it's not so much about the course, but what modules are available for you.If you want to be more specific, then go look up on what the job you are aiming for does, and then ask here again, or ask your lecturers.Some of the more general but useful modules are like Management Accounting( you have to take Intro first), Corporate Finance, Macroeconomics are pretty useful for you to learn how the economy and how companies work as well as how some decisions are made.Personally I've taken a few management modules as well, but don't find them very useful as they are very theoretical and history based. I also regret not taking up more marketing modules!0 comments3"
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019What is your current paper qualification? Are u still a student or intending to change career?If you are doing mid career change, u can consider trying to achieve CFA. The title has more value than the degree course. It is not just useful in finance related, but also in other fields it will carry some weight. 2 comments0"
3,"Question Poster14 Nov 2018A pre-U student!Yixiong Chang14 Nov 2018if u go to a local uni, eg nus. Typically is just the BBA (bachelor in business administration). What is actually important is to be pro-active, getting to intern in a good company will give u a good head start. To be honest, what course is not really important in 'finance' related jobs. Unless u want to do something skill specific like accounting, then u have to take the accounting route. 

Also, start with the CFA when u are in 3rd year or so. Try to get the CFA level 1 passed by the time u start applying for a job. "
