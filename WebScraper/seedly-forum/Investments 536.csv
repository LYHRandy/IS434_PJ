1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 16 Sep 2019I echo the sentiments of the other answers here and will recommend you separate insurance from investments. You can do better investing directly or via an advisor without being subjected to the myriad of terms and conditions that come with a policy contract.4 comments5"
2,"See all 4 comments Question Poster16 Sep 2019Yes as a pure investment plan, how bad are the fees as compared to the convenience of having someone settling for you?Elijah Lee16 Sep 2019That depends on the individual policy details. Some can be quite high. Generally the fees that hit you are from the policy, not the individual UT."

Grand MasterUpdated on 15 Sep 2019Don't mix insurance with investment.Inevitably, you will invite extra management fees (from the insurers), extra admin costs, extra sales charge etc.Every insurance-investment policy has this admin/policy fee stuff that no one can ever explain... $5 per month for policy feesFeeder fund policy fees, where insurer charge a small fee for sending your money to the investment fund (where u could have done it yourself)management fees are usually higher than normal funds.sales charge (to the adviser and manager and his director)and of course mortality charges.worst of all? they don't get these fees from the money you paid directly. Your money buys units in the funds, then they deduct the units from your fund immediately to pay those charges. You know why? Coz they get to earn an extra 5% off the spread between bid-ask for the funds.EXTRA PROFITS for them =)Get Investment straight from the investment experts.You don't go to a dentist to ask for cardio heart issue right?0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2019If such products are not advisor driven i.e being pushed or recommended by agents to end consumers, I'd say there's a chance they will die off. Robo-advisories are still relatively new and their branding/marketing is not as deeply entrenched as compare to insurers.0 comments0"
