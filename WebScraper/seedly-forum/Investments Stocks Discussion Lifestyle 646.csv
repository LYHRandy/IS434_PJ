1,"Eric Ong CfaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 22 Aug 2019I would say, before going into what to buy, you can identify what's the return you are looking at, what are the risks that you are able to stomach, the timeline that you are looking at, and liquidity factor (whether you have enough extra cash)ETF and the individual company are two different assets. So for STI ETF, you are investing Singapore Market at large, as it is a basket of companies, the risk is comparably lower, as it spreads across 30 companies.For Singapore Airlines, your return will only be based on Single Company, in other words, your risk is tied to a single company.0 comments8"
