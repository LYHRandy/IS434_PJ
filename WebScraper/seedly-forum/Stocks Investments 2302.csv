1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hi there!Just to add on to what has already been mentioned - i think the benefits lie in how shorting the S&P 500 at the right time can be beneficial (however, it is not advisable to start shorting if you are new to investing/trading as the potential losses are infinite).During the DotCom Bubble Burst as well as the Global Financial Crisis, the S&P 500 tanked almost 50%... (if im not wrong) and imagine if you had the foresight and information you need to predict this kind of price movements, shorting the S&P 500 could bring about large benefits.The truth is.. people are usually overconfident and bullish on the stock market, as evident by what Leonard mentioned, where S&P grows at 7% annually on average, such a downturn don't last for long and its also difficult to anticipate/predict such a drop in share prices.0 comments0"

Shorting the S&P 500 can be used as a diversifying tool to reduce market risk exposure- especially when one already owns a basket of stocks(example value stocks). In this example, any gains in your portfolio would theoretically be due to its value premium net of market gains. But as what Richard said- bare in mind statistically you are going against headwinds of average S&P500 appreciation of 7% annually. Therefore, such a move would only make sense with some sort of market timing beliefs.0 comments0"

After all, it is just the opposite of buying and holding the S&P index (longing the index) - you think the price will fall, so you sell the shares of the S&P 500 of another investor, and promise to return him at a later date, which the difference in price due to the fall is your profit because you buyback shares at a cheaper price.Right now the S&P does have somewhat weak performance, and it's been on a losing streak for a few days now. Perhaps shorting may be a good move in the short run, but never in the long run, since the S&P has always been at a LT uptrend since inception.0 comments0"
