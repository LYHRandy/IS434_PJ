1,"Luke Ho, Kick-Ass Financial Services Consultant at Trillion Financial PlannersLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jul 2019I've studied IQuadrant intensely after taking some interest in it from a highly amusing advertisement they had. In my spare time I try to write about it - I want to write a small book and see Germaine's reaction, maybe meet her in person. The trio is interesting.
While the methodology is claimed to be taken from Marko (the comments on Marko's video ads have openly suggested this, to which Marko has agreed), I'm not sure if its exactly the same.
They have a whole slew of calculation errors for their net profits - which if MAS heard of in its entirety would probably ban - and they also don't have a viable solution for the fact that most industrial properties don't appreciate like residential properties.
I can't comment whether its worth the time and money, but if YOU can figure out and put in the work to get 'No Money Down' I can help take that money and outperform iQuadrant net of fees pretty easily....okay to be fair to the polarized index investors here, you could even use a Robo or the SNP500 (both of which my clients have outperformed for a while no) to do it. That's actually how low the net return is.
Some common no money down methods are:1) Wholesaling2) Seller Financing3) A loan, investor or partner4) A lease option5) A collective investment scheme (3 on a bigger scale)I'd rather not digress too much in public, but we could always have a private conversation.
