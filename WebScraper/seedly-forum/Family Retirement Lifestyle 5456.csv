God of WisdomAnswered on 20 Aug 2019Your question is actually rather vaguely worded and if you would be clearer with what you are looking for, it will be easier to get the right advice.Currently, you have stated a few points with regards to your life situation, which is great for a start, but I am not sure exactly what kind of advice you are looking for? A number of things can happen in the next 30 years: Planning for potential future children expenses? Planning for retirement? Planning to ensure that you can service your car/HDB loans? Budgeting to ensure your parents are also taken care of financially? These are the potential issues that will probably be running in your mind now, and if you can pick the most critical issues that you wish to plan for, I would be able to provide more directed and useful advice.On the surface, a 4 room BTO flat should not stretch your finances, but if you are looking at adding a car to the mix (alongside the costs of raising children), you'll want to ensure you budget properly. Also, don't forget to take care of your own retirement as well. You will be better suited to defensive investments like annuities for that if you cannot stomach risk.0 comments6"

God of WisdomAnswered on 20 Aug 2019It's great that such platforms exist for people to get advice from a community of like-minded folks.But for cases such as yours, I'm sure a trusted individual that is licensed to help take a closer look and plan with you would be more fruitful.I suggest finding an Independent Financial Advisor, as well as a Property Agent to work with you closely to help you path out your next 30 years.There's too much to get into online without knowing much more from you guys. All I can provide are guidelines and rules of thumb, but I'm sure you'd do better with in-depth advice.0 comments2"
