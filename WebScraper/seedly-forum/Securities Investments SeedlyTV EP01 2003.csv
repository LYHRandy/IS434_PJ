But if you are just starting out on investing and have a low capital budget, perhaps something like maybank ke's monthly investment plan? You can start with an amount of $100 per counter per month.Do your own research on the stock and set aside your emergency funds first before you start. Won't hurt to find out how you psychologically handle money as well. This helps determine your risk profile in a way and will better equip you in your investment journey. Hope this helps0 comments0"
