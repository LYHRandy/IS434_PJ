1,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Pros:Have more interaction amongst family members, happier home.Potentially have more children to take care of you when you're old. Double edged sword though. They could turn out to be unfilial. Who knows?Less lonely at home, can talk to your children.Cons:Costlier,  higher maintenance of monthly household expenses.May need to worry about each child's development, need some micro management to ensure each child is doing well.Lack of living space when every child grows up. They lack privacy and their own personal space when they grow up. For example, if you have 3 boys and 2 girls, you can't possibly place the boy and the girl in the same room when they grow up.Less time for your spouse, as most of your time is being spent on your children.In conclusion, it's all about time management and self-management to ensure a happy family.Cheers.1 comment1"
