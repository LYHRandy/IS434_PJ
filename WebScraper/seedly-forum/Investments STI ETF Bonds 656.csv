question,"Investments STI ETF Bonds Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Aug 2019Nikko AM STI ETF or ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund?I am looking to start investing via the POSB Invest Saver in either of the two abovementioned options. I also read that when stocks tank, the value of bonds go up. With this in mind, should I choose to invest in ABF considering that there is news that a recession might be coming? Or does it not matter since I am planning to do this on a long term basis?4 answersAnswerBump0"
