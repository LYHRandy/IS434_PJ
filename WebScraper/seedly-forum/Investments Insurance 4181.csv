1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Its certainly a good plan, having the highest total number of conditions/special benefits in the market presently. The value to you is debatable though, because similar products are cheaper or have additional benefits or are more easily claimable, etc. Each one has their profs and cons. As a Financial Advisor who understands and offers multiple products, Id also suggest you look at the updated Aviva MultiCI plan.If multi pay is not as concerning as getting early critical illness protection (which is my specialty) I can actually compare across all the major insurers and suggest, depending on your age, a plan that might be more appropriate for your needs.
