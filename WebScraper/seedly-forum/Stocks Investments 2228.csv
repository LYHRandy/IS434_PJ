1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Mar 2019Definitely Bloomberg's 5 things to start your day, as well as their Market Wrap segment. I like to throw in The Economist and abit of Wall street Journal as well for their more macroeconomic opinion articles. Makes for less dry reading as well.I rarely use Yahoo Finance unless I'm doing a quick stock price check - However they do have a rather comprehensive charting system, for a free to use website.0 comments1"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Bloomberg and Reuters are both great for market data. Other favourites are:
Google Finance
Seeking Alpha
13D research - once you have gone through the basics. Not free, but good.0 comments1"
