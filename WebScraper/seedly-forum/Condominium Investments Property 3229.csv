2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Oct 2018There are many things to factor in when it comes to overseas property for rental purposes. Securing a tenant, property maintenance, taxes both local and in the country you bought the property.. And there's no guarantee you will be able to get a tenant all the time.. REITS will be a better choice, both from a yield perspective as well as its simplicity (when compared to owning property outright). Hope this helps. 0 comments1"
3,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 05 Oct 2018for the common investor, REITS is prolly much safer. Getting the real estate itself is tricky. You have to consider laws (which can change anytime), interest rates, occupancy, management, etc. If uncompleted, you also run the risk of developer going bust, bad construction, mismanaged funds, etc. It's kinda like comparing growth (buying real estate) and dividend stocks (reits).0 comments1"
