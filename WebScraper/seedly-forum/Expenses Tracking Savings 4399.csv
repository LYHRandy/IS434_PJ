1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 21 May 2019For a foreigner in a non-Singaporean perspective for paying off student loan while saving money in Singapore:1. Bring monthly Telco prices downCircles Life is hands-down my favourite telco provider to date. Not just for the price, but they also hold cool hangouts for their Circles Life users! For eg. I recently went Light Saber sparring at The Saber Authority, kindly organized by the Inner Circles team. Amazing outing for a Sunday evening, and perfect for Star Wars fans. Use my referral code JUNUS during your Circles Life signup and get $34 off your registration fee and also UNLIMITED Data free for 3 months.2. Bring food costs down while eating out (especially since you can't eat at home): Tip 1Embrace Hawkers for cost per meal to be around the range of S$3-5. 3. Bring food costs down: Tip 2Check out Fave - sometimes with the 1-for-1 deals, its possible to get good meals for $5 per pax. 4. Bring coffee costs down.Instead of fancy coffee like Starbucks etc, make friends with your friendly Malay kopitiam uncle. Amazing coffee and teh halia for under $1.50 5. Bring workout costs down.From monthly membership fees of over $100 for big gyms like Fitness First to more bespoke solutions like Classpass, these options will cost you a few hundred a month for working out. Instead, head out and make use of the exercise parks all over Singapore. Pull-ups are a great work out, and can be done with a pull-up bar outdoors. Other workouts like mountain climbers, burpees and running etc are also options.0 comments3"

3,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered 3w agoI have no such blog, but I can understand the biggest costs in Singapore should be rental.If you can, choose places that are less accessible (means you have to take a bus, MRT to reach most places), these places are a lot cheaper to rent.Food-wise, you have hawker centres that are offering really cheap food options, can be cheaper than home-cooked meals too, to be honest.The good news about Singapore- despite the higher expenses, this is a good place to earn and save :) Enjoy your stay in Singapore!0 comments0"

5,"Terng Shing ChenLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 09 Nov 2018Saw this on Quora and here's my response to that.There are many ways to save money in Singapore that applies to anyone. Some that I can think of, include:Eating at hawkers or foodcourts instead of restaurants. Healthy options are available if you look for them.Public transport is awesome, so use the MRT and familiarise yourself with the bus routes - at most you’ll spend 3–4 bucks a day.Healthcare is pricey, so look for affordable options like GetDoc Plus, which gives you discounts when you go to clinics for a dollar a month, and if you’re a student, it goes down to 50c a monthIf you like to party, do it at your dorm room or a friend’s house. Clubbing and drinking in Singapore is very expensive.Mobile data costs can be saved if you use the free wifi that almost every single building and cafe offers. Circle’s Life also offers affordable data packages.That’s about it, but I am sure there are more.0 comments0"
