MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018It depends if you plan to take the whole family on a trip with the miles or if you rather get rebates for your family expenses ​I think it is a good time to sign up for a new Credit card. Check out the current promos such as Citi PRVI or Amex true cash at 3% for the first 6 months ​as mentioned by some of the others here it is critical to check it cc is accepted else there is no point in the sign up.0 comments1"

Remember not to get installments from courts to get laptops etc.  As you will end up paying much more than the original price. 0 comments1"

Are you planning for a trip involving flights in the next few years? Or is your immediate concern about saving as much as possible through cash back for your renovation?​Speaking of which, do check if your vendor accepts credit card payments. My main contractor only accepted cash / cheque when I was doing renovation for my BTO. If you are using it to buy furniture or electrical items, then it's likely to be accepted.​Assuming you decide to go for cash back, can look at StanChart's Manhanttan card, which gives up to 3% cashback (minimum $3,000 spend and capped at S$200 per quarter). Other alternatives would be their Unlimited Cashback card which gives 1.5% (without cap or minimum spend) or Amex's True Cashback card going at the same cashback rate.​For miles, the best cards breakdown is available on the MileLion website (https://milelion.com/credit-cards/credit-card-overview/).​Hope this helpe and all the best.​0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018American express true cashback card is 1.5% and promotion 3% for first 6 months cap at $5000. Maybank FC Barcelona Visa is 1.6%. SCB unlimited cashback is 1.5%. This 3 credit card have no earn cap and cashback is for all spending but just remember to double check the T&Cs. I feel to choose miles or cashback is your preference. Im not too sure about miles card.0 comments1"
