1,"Adam Wong, Editor-in-chief at The Fifth PersonLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 4w agoJust to give a quick overview, Brexit means that the UK will lose its free trade access with the EU. Unless the UK negotiates a deal in time, companies in the UK face potential tariffs and taxes when exporting to the EU. This obviously hits their bottom line and, therefore, their share price.On a market level, a situation like Brexit creates uncertainty and the markets hate uncertainty. And when markets are uncertain, investors are more cautious until the outlook becomes clearer in the near future.0 comments2"
