1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019I do think you should really speak to a consultant like myself who has a lot of experience dealing in this area.Typically what I'll do is do some calculations based on 1) how long you've paid for the policies, 2) how much you could stand to lose, 3) whether it's worth keeping in relation to the value of the policy (some whole life policies are extremely good), etc.I'll also calculate what will happen if 4) you buy Term and how I can help you invest the rest, 5) what kind of yield is required to break even on losses and make some gains that are higher than the whole life policy, etc.Please do contact me so I can help you with this.https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
