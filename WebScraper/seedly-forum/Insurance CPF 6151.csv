1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Upgrade your Eldershield and change your Basic Eldershield to Careshield Life. It's already been said that you can keep your ES Supplement and be on the new Careshield Life plan, in fact you get subsidies to do so.0 comments2"
2,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 12 Jun 2019You should upgrade your eldershield and change your basic eldershield to careshield. Eldershield takes care of long term care when you are unable to. its a great policy introduced by the government.0 comments1"
3,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 02 Jul 2019Like what Hariz mentioned! That would be a wise choice since no one can guarantee their health conditions in the future. While healthy and 1 year younger, upgrading your eldershield would be a better choice!On top of which, Aviva's eldershield upgrade allows one to be able to claim when 2 out of 6 ADLs are met. As for the Careshield upgrade, details are yet to be made known2 comments1"
4,"Question Poster14 Jun 2019Careshield is going to give me $600/mth for lifetime. Why do I still need to upgrade my eldershield other then the ADLs? Isn't there will be a overlapping of coverages?Brandan Chen02 Jul 2019If you upgrade early, you could get up to 1.4k monthly payout for 2 out of 6 ADLs. Subsequently when careshield is launched, you can convert your existing basic eldershield to careshield to increase your payout by another 200 per month"
5,"Siow Nan, Electrical And Computer Engineering at NusLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Upgrade especially now they provide rebates to you for upgrading.
But my question is more of whether I should opt out of eldershield / careshield life since it is more of a basic level of support for sgreans without other private insurance schemes to protect in case of critical situations. As I am covered already under private disability/critical illnesses insurance... The question is whether I would need careshield life comes to play or to save this premium4 comments0"
6,See all 4 comments Hariz Arthur Maloy11 Jun 2019Eldershield and Careshield Life are Long Term Care policies. They cover you for life. It's a separate policy to disability income which ends at age 65 usually and TPD which ends at age 70 (usually).Siow Nan11 Jun 2019Agreed
