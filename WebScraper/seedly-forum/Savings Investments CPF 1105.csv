You are right that the interest rate is good for the special account but I think you can optimize way better if you are intending to keep the funds in your ordinary account instead. When I was your age, I invested my money in the stock market and the reason being is to aim for a higher return and time is in my favor. I will be able to hold long term and in  a broadbase investment strategy, you should be able to get more than the 2.5%or 3.5% that you are getting from your OA. And also the liquidity that comes with it.0 comments0"
