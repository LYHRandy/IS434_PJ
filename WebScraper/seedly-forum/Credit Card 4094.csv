1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 29 Jun 2019I dont have a good card to recommend, but I noticed among the younger folks around me, those with credit cards have been slowly rolling into the debt trap, versus those that are still dependent on debit cards.It blew their minds out when I explained that they are paying 2% interest monthly on their unpaid balances, and how the minimum payment is lulling them into fallacy.  the keyword here is 2% monthly interest which works out to be probably 26+% annually, whereas cpf education loan is 2.5% yearly. Not to say credit cards are evil, but making only minimum payment each month will surely lead you into the debt trap. Always pay in full, and preferably one to two days before due date to avoid late payment charge.2nd tip: if you have trouble controlling your spend on credit card, you can always request lowering your credit limit. I did this online, and my credit limit is only 3,000 (quite below my salary).0 comments0"
2,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Jun 2019It would depends on your situation and the below factors.
1. Your spending pattern (min spend per month, what categories do you spend on the most, consistent spending per month etc)
2. Cashback or air miles
3. Are you looking at using the card together with high interest savings account?
4. Promotions (free luggage or cashback, do note on the T&c; some require min spend before you can claim the free stuff)Based on the above, you can check our credit card comparisons on sites like Seedly, Singsaver, Moneysmart to come to a conclusion.0 comments0"
