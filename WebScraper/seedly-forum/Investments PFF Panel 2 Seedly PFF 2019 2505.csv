1,"Tai Zhi, Chief Investment Officer at AutowealthLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 16 Jun 2019Dividends and bond coupons of U.S.-listed ETFs will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax in line with tax regulations of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Nevertheless, U.S.listed ETFs are still preferred over ETFs listed in other countries like the U.K. after taking into consideration factors including liquidity, bid-ask spread, expense ratio, ETF fund size amongst other factors.You may want to consider investing through a robo-advisor for better tax efficiency. For example, AutoWealth works with our partnering custodian to seek partial reimbursement of the withholding taxes from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. This would reduce the withholding taxes applicable.You may check out this url to learn more from frequently asked questions by other investors: https://www.autowealth.sg/faq.php1 comment1"
2,"T@Takingstock @16 Jun 2019Thanks Tai Zhi. After considering for a very long while, I believe the tax impact of overseas investments is quite large, and I might probably be dividends via local stocks and reits which are tax free (only taxed once in the company).

3,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019One example is the US withholding tax. You have to pay 30% withholding tax on the US stocks/ETFs dividends. So the higher dividends you get from the investments, the more tax (fees) you will incur. Alternatively, you can invest in an Ireland domiciled ETF from the london stock exchange which will reduce the tax from 30% to 15%. However, there are lesser Ireland domiciled ETF compared to the US ones and may have lower trading volume.0 comments0"
