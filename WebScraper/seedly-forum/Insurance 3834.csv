1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 30 Apr 2019Your  incomeshield plan B is your hospitalisation coverage. Why did u think u didnt have any? During the financial counselling of your hospitalisation u should have been advised by the admission staff? =DYou should consider upgrading your hospitalisation plan, either to planP or to the enhanced incomeshield. For you age, a term $400k coverage for life and ci until age65 will only cost u less than $800/yr. What was the exact diagnosis (this nerve condition) u mentioned? It might affect your ability to purchase future insurance. Were u hospitalised in a private or restructured hospital?0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 30 Apr 2019Your NTUC incomeshield plan B is your hospitalization coverage.I'd recommend that you apply for preliminary underwriting for CI and Life cover, and see what the underwriters have to say about accepting your case.You should try and apply for as much CI cover they're willing to give you and as much as you can afford. It could be one of the last few times you can get covered.0 comments0"
