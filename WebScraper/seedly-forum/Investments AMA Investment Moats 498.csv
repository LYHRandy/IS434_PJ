1,"Ng Lip Hong Kyith, Computing at National University of SingaporeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018The big one is to listen to too much doom and gloom advice. That is before 2007. And then when the time comes failing to execute and losing my head in the process.After that, you just became so cautious because every draw down in the markets feels like a 50% draw down coming. Due to that, I failed to stay in the markets. When you fail to stay in the markets you might missed out on losses. But you also incurred alot of opportunity cost of what it could have been.I could certainly reach my objective 2 years earlier had I not have that overhang.Having said that, we might always learn the wrong lesson. I think for myself, it is to understand that in the markets, markets tend to be positively skewed most of the time, and that the negative portion tends to be more swift. So plan your decisions accordingly.Don't be 100% in cash, be 100% in equities when general market valuation metrics become more attractive. If you are either 100% or not 100%, psychologically you feel that urgency to do something.If you have purchase a group of stuff you would want to hold for long, your brains won't be so frantic to make a move. There might be a tendency to make rash decision there. Always be prospecting stocks. When you have a wider pool of opportunities, you won't be scared to miss out on something you think it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.its good to have alot of great opportunities then one0 comments9"

And all the mistake make me more aware and improve my decision making in my investing journey.For example, ""Following"" Gurus, ""Following"" Buy/Sell Call, Rush into Investing because fear of missing out.....The Takeway:Always do my best to make a concious and independent decision at the moment. Although I may not cover every blindspot at the moment, at least I did my best base on my personal decision.Everyone could have different results, and at different pace, so it is ok that my portfolio didn't grow as fast.0 comments7"

Stock tanked, and even went into a 4-1 consolidation... Still held on as a reminder to myself to never get into IPOs of companies that I don't know about or have done much research on.​Also regretting selling puts on SPY 3 years back. Should have trusted my gut and bought the put and not sold it. 0 comments4"

If it is just to open an account, just open the account and not get plans that bankers sells you. Unfortunatly, most of the time plans sold to you at the banks are not what you need.0 comments2"

8,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2019Absolutely no regrets.I enjoyed every failure that has come together with success.Let me explain. I have a trading friend who takes all the safe trades and ignores the non-safe trades. He has about 2% trades that go wrongI take the risk trades and I have abt 30% that goes wrong.But the 70% that succeed, they succeed with a much bigger return. Yeah, I lost money in 30%, but the losses are so much lower than the winnings.Do I regret the 30%? I can't regret them.... I can't choose only the winners (I am no guru), so I can only choose what I know and as long as overall I am making money, I am happy.Most of the people that I know with 0% failures are those who never even try or don't dare to try.No regrets guys! Every investment failure is something for you to learn and grow richer (if you choose to learn from it)0 comments1"

12,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Yes. It's that I brush off financial consider too difficult and didn't start young. ​If able to turn back time, I would have tell the high school me to start now, starting savings, learn how to read financial statement and learn how to ask to open CDP account and start investing rather than wasting time doing / pursuing anything else. ​Nevertheless, it's never too late better than never. Starts Now!0 comments0"
