1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Aug 2019Sadly there isn't a sure fire way. What works for one person may not work for you or others due to differing personalities and opportunities presented and decisions made.For me personally, I'm working to retire just beyond 40 by managing a portfolio of option positions. This allows me to generate consistent returns of 40% onwards per year. Chanced upon this by seeing a Facebook ad a few years back and following my now mentor to learn more. Won't say it's an easy journey as there's much to learn, unlearn and relearn but am getting there. Grit, discipline, seizing the opportunity and owning my mistakes are characteristics I developed along the way. Not sure what are your current circumstances. Hope this gives you just an idea of the many ways you can use to reach your goal. All the best in your journey. All the best.0 comments1"
