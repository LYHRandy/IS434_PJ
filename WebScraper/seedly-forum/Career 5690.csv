question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Nov 2018I went to a job interview specifically telling them that overtime is a dealbreaker for me. They assured me that they don't make people do overtime, but so far I do almost every day. What should I do?To give more context, it's a design job, and during my interview I had to sketch something out for them on the spot. They loved it, and also assured me there would be no overtime involved. Turns out the person who interviewed me is not my boss, and my boss herself sets impossible deadlines, and the best of all is that I don't do design work there. If it were design work and I have to overtime, I can cope with that. But i hate that I'm not doing design, and still have to overtime.6 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Jul 2019Definitely speak to your bosss about it.
Long story short: If they love your work, then they should be more respectful to their employees in terms of time and effort.
Are there other alternatives outside the firm that you can consider? If your skills are also recognized in other firms, and they have bosses with more integrity, than it might be an option to move!0 comments2"
2,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 16 Jul 2019My immediate reaction to your post is; “Come on who are you kidding! A design job without OT? That’s like KFC without chicken!”Onward to solving your problem; I suggest that you flag it up to your boss to ask for more design related jobs. Behind their back you look for another job with preferably a better salary. Alternatively if there is a new project you could volunteer yourself to take the designing for the new job. Sometime you’ve got to ask for something to get it. Noticed this was posted late last year. Hopefully your situation has improved, otherwise it’s time to make a move. (But remember to quietly get the new job first before resigning)0 comments0"

4,Jeff YeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Nov 2018Have an open convention with your boss if a change of job scope is possible. If things do not change for the better consider a few things does working the current role help with your overall skill set development ? Will sticking to your current role provide a chance to move up ? if the answer is no then it is time to move 0 comments0
