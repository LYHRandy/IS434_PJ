question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Apr 2019Private or Govt Hospital?Hi, any advice on deciding to go for private or govt hospital when it comes to minor surgery (eg. Lump removal and investigation)? Assuming one is covered for private hospitalisation. One factor of concern if going for private is the post hospitalization expenses that may turn out to be substantial if the condition requires follow up and it exceeds the coverage period. Anybody has similar experiences to share if this should be of concern? Thankyou!1 answerAnswerBump0"

If you've already got the appropriate insurance that covers a private hospital, just GO according to your coverage. If your post-hosp coverage isn't long enough, get a new one! (I'm just kidding most of them with the full rider should be at least 6 months, likely a year)0 comments0"
