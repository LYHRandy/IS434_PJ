1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Mar 2019I think in general it will be a positive move for Apple. I will just list a few traits here that might be relevant for Apple's strengths and weaknesses. Apple Devices: Apple has already sold almost 1.4bn devices. With this vast number of devices already circulating in the homes and pockets of users, Apple can easily leverage on its devices to push its streaming services. This advantage isn't shared by other players such as Disney, Hulu and AmazonGo. By having a variety of devices at consumers disposal, Apple can leverage on this by integrating its streaming services into the other devices that consumers already have. This can improve the overall user experience and ease of users. Some studies have even showed that even capturing a small percentage of its users on Apple devices can be a boost to Apple's bottom line.Experience in Streaming Services: Apple isn't entirely new to the streaming services sector, having a ganered a strong following of 50 million users on it's Apple music globally (Spotify has 90mn). What's different from its competition is that Apple can provide bundles with the Apple music, as some people have speculated. This can be a strong move to bring more people on board the streaming service. Brand Equity: Apple has one of the strongest brand equity out there. In terms of brand loyalty and fan based, they probably have more than the other competitors like Netflix because of their sheer customer base and track record. This can help draw Apple fans who have not subscribed to any streaming services before.0 comments1"
