question,"Lifestyle General Asked by Good Day Every DayAsked on 27 Jun 2019I was charged $0.60 for making a call to join a group in England after downloading Telegram app. This is despite the fact that I used my data to make the call. Is this the norm? I am new to Telegram, so I'm unsure why I have to pay for a call?3 answersAnswerBump0"
