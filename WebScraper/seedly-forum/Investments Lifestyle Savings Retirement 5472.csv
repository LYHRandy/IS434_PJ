ProdigyAnswered on 01 Jul 2019It's probably a question that I have for a long while since  2017/2018 where some of my peers were speculating a market fall since historical trends does suggest 8/9 years between financial crises. I don't disagree that human tendency is to catch prices at low prices (and they will present themselves when the crisis does happen) but its hard to put a date and time range when that will happen. In that span of 1-2 years that I'm been sitting on the fence, it's a lost opportunity as markets have been generally going up and you might be in the losing end of the bargain if you are putting money in the bank at dismal interest. So long story short, put your money to work no matter what instrument (savings bond, endowment etc.) but keep your war chest fluid to capitalize on the market recession (which IMHO, should come before end 2020). Patience and diligence wins the race.All the best to FIRE!0 comments3"
