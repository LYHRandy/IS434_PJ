1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Building on Zann's answer, liquidity ratios can help you understand the credit strength of the company. For a retail investor, this could be more important if you would like to buy bonds from this company, since one of the risks associated with buying bonds is the default risk of a company. For this, you might wanna read up also on leverage, coverage and solvency ratios since I feel that liquidity ratios alone won't be sufficient and definitely the credit ratings given by rating agencies.Something else that might be relevant could also be what liquidity ratios are being used for comparison. Current, quick and cash ratios tell you different things about a company and what kind of working capital policies that they have. For example, holding too much cash may not be a good thing because it means that the company isn't investing the cash to expand the business, while holding a disproporitonate amount of inventory is also bad since cash is tied up there. 0 comments0"
