question,"PFF Panel 4 Investments Seedly PFF 2019 Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Mar 2019If you had $100K spare cash (with emergency fund set aside), what would you do with it?I'm more on the conservative side, if capital guaranteed would be better. Was putting into fixed deposit for 6 months, thinking I might need the money in the near future. I fear of losing the money but yet at the same time I wish to use this 100K to earn even more money. What is a good balance?2 answersAnswerBump1"

But you also want to use the 100k to earn more money.So what about splitting it into two pots? This is what we call portfolio allocation. Have some in risk-free investments, some in low-risk investments, and the rest in mid to higher risk investments.0 comments0"
