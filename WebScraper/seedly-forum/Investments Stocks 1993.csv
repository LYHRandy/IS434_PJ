1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Apr 2019It's all about your own principle.Do you invest in a company for the CSR they do? But then again, are these CSR done out of altruism, really wanting to give back to the society or you investing in a company / management that simply practise CSR to look good on papers / annual reports.No company is an all-rounder. Always look back at what you would like to achieve from investing, which I believe ought to be somewhere along the lines of growing your wealth.Therefore, CSR / Sustainability practices should never be your decision-maker in making an investment but only a plus-point to a company that you see has growth potential.0 comments0"
2,"SWShaun Wq LimLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Apr 2019Depends on your personal ethos. Do all these matter to YOU and how much do they matter to YOU?If you look at companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix or Apple, not all of them have such priorities stated as part fo their business strategy. Not to mention “vice” companies like cigarette makers or casinos.If your focus is on generating returns and the others are only good to have for you, I would say not important.If your focus is on supporting companies that are ethical and do the right things to support communities and the environment while trying to build your wealth, then yes.0 comments0"
