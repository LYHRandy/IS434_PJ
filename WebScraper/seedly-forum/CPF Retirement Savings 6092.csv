question,"CPF Retirement Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Aug 2019Should I do a monthly or annual transfer of funds from OA to SA?I'm currently 31 and doing a monthly transfer from OA to SA with the target to hit the projected FRS (300+K) when I hit 55 yo. From an efficiency point of view, would doing this transfer annually be better in the sense that it would allow me to earn the same interest by doing a monthly transfer?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 30 Aug 2019CPF calculates interest on a monthly basis, using the lowest amount for that month. As such, a monthly transfer should earn you slightly more interest than an annual top-up. That being said, for efficiency, an annual transfer from OA to SA would be better.1 comment2"
