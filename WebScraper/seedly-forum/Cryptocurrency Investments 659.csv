WonderkidAnswered on 20 Aug 2019Educate yourself, learn as much as you can about Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies and only put in small amounts, call it ""beer money"" if you will.

4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Aug 2019Don't ""invest"" in something you do not understand. There have been a number of scams surrounding crypto in general, with many ICOs being duds. I've been through some myself, and lost some bit of money.
If you really want to enter into bitcoin, trade it actively and don't hold it. Find a platform that gives you good buy and sell signals and go from there.0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 06 Aug 2019I will consider it more of a gamble than an investment because there are no fundamentals that are supporting the ""prices"" of these ""products"".Blockchain is a noble idea but without proper adoption and support of cryptocurrency by sufficicently large organisations and governments, it all remains a pipe dream.0 comments0"

7,"Edleo Peralta21 Aug 2019I think bitcoin and other cryptos are more risky to invest in. One must do his/her due diligence in getting into these types of investment. I would rather invest in gold and silver first before investing in crypto currencies. Just ""my two cents""."
