1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Yes you are right, DBS Multiplier is just a DBS MCA with steroid at higher interest rate. ​I don't see any downside except the min 3k  balance or else with admin charges and the higher interest rates (eg.1.85%) comes at the cost that one must do 2 types of transactions with DBS. ​​​0 comments0"

5,"ZongzongLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jul 2018It's just a higher-interest savings account, so it behaves like normal savings account. ​One downside I could spot is the fall-below-service-fee they charge. DBS Multiplier's minimum average $3000 or they will start charging you $5, whereas the normal savings account is just $1000.​If you don't wish to park $3000 there, you might want to close the account. I don't use Vickers.0 comments0"
