WizardAnswered on 17 Jul 2019Whether there is profit or dividends depends on the investing method and funds they choose.The basic premise is usually dollar cost averaging and rebalancing of portfolio automatically. It helps remove the emotional aspect and market timing aspect. Users also do not have to fret over which ETF or which fund to buy.Dividends are typically reinvested to grow the portfolio.0 comments0"
