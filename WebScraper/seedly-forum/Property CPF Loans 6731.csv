question,Property CPF Loans Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Jun 2019What are the exact processes in buying a resale private property without an agent? My fianc√©e and I have been looking for houses for the past 2-3 months and had no luck in getting an agent look for houses for us. We recently saw one property which we really like but are not sure what are the things to watch out for if we really purchase. Please help! Thank you!2 answersAnswerBump0

The agent can't decide for you, means you have to visit every house on your own anyway, so why choose an agent for extra agent fees? (Unless you are really busy, your time is worth a lot, and your property is really expensive so you need an experienced agent to filter for you first)Once you get the house (be it a condo, HDB, landed), go google for the address and see if there was any news related to it. :) Google is useful.Meiling has written a great answer with a terrific link, you will love it!0 comments0"
2,"Meiling TanLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated 3w agoThere's a full guide on how to buy a resale private property at this link. But since you already have a place in mind, here's what to look out for next (Step 6 onwards if you look at the guide):Ask when the last renovations were done, as older private properties can start to present issues with plumbing, electrical circuits, etc. after 12-15 yearsCheck for damaged or cracked tiles, flooring, and walls. These can indicate deeper structural issuesCheck for peeling paint, which may indicate leaks or water seepageLook out for ""perpetually wet"" patches of flooring, which may indicate cracked pipes (and cost you thousands in repairs)Check for rotten or termite-ridden wood (hardwood floors, furniture, door frames, windows, etc.)Make an excuse to use the bathroom and flush the toilet to check on the flush power. If it's weak, there may be a clogged drain.Look out for rust-coloured or ""bloodstained"" streaks on the walls, which could mean bedbugs.You'll also want to make sure the OTP has an inspection clause, so you can go through the house in more detail before the close of the sale. That way, you can catch any defects BEFORE the handover and have the sellers fix them -- else you may be stuck with tens of thousands in repairs.Assuming you've already got your loan paperwork in order, all that's left are the legal processes that your conveyancing lawyer will help you with. These include:Running a title search to make sure the seller is really the owner of the property (and isn't conning you)Doing a background check on the seller to ensure he's not secretly an undischarged bankruptActing for you in the mortgage (banks have their own panels of lawyers, but they may not be the cheapest options)Sending a request to CPF to allow you to use your CPF funds for the purchase0 comments0"
