1,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Depends on what you like. I've had colleagues who do well with carrots & celery in NZ company culture and for all others; chocolate do the trick (dark choc with at least 70% solids are healthy and good combo especially with almond). Most important thing is look at labels and don't get anything processed if you're looking for healthy snacks.​If nuts is an option for you; simply swing by cold storage for their selection by weight (the type you can select and weigh accordingly). I find it more affordable than nuts specialty shops and those packaged version seems to always be of sugarcoated or salt laden option.​Otherwise if cookies are your calling(mine is), try to find your neighbourhood if there are any bakeries with healthier options.1 comment2"

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 18 May 2019The thing about snacks is.. they tend to be addictive and when they are, you will tend to keep eating it.So even with the most well-meaning of healthy snacks (say for example, almonds), I would just go through many packs if it was in front of me. Many packs = $$$. So even with the most affordable of snacks, it really won't be so affordable for me if I eat lots of it.What I do, to keep myself from snacking lots, is to drink alot of water and green tea in the office.0 comments1"
4,"Val ChiaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 18 Feb 2019EDAMAME. You can get 2 bags of these at below 5 sgd, enough for 6 snack portions (or if like me who loves edamame, i eat half a bag at once hahaha). Its yummy, easy to prep and relatively healthy. If fresh fruits etc are difficult, try dried fruits. Do try to get the non-sweetened kind though, those have alot of sugars. For a good balance i usually  buy raw nuts (sometimes with shells on, even, but you can get those that have not been baked in larger quantities at wholesale stores!) and then during the weekedns, ill throw them all into the oven to bake then mix them with some dried fruits in an airtight container. Then throughout the work week i'll pour some into a small container  and snack on that at work. A good mix of vitamins and minerals just from that~ then once in awhile i'll switch it out for edamame or rice crackers.0 comments1"
5,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 1w agoI personally love a good crunchy apple (might irritate people with the crunching though, sorry neighbour) It's healthy, stops hungry pangs for those on diet, better at keeping you awake & alert than coffee (read this somewhere)cheap & easy to get (giant sells gala apples for $2.25 for 5)0 comments0"
6,"Valerie PriyaLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 04 Mar 2019I really recommend Freeze Dried Fruit Chips. So, I have a sweet tooth and normally craving for something to eat around 4ish in the office. Unfortunately, nuts don't satisfy my craving. Then my friend suggested these fruit chips that has no oil, sugar or preservatives. Plus, I am surprised how crunchy it is! P.S My favourite is Longan Chips.I can't find them anywhere else besides online so maybe you'd like to give it a try: www.superlife.coHope this helps! :)0 comments0"
7,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Aug 2018I recently fell in love with this snack called Twiglets~!​It's actually 80% wholewheat and there is a marmite (beer) taste to it. Let me give you an image below...​In fact it was recommended as one of the healthiest snacks in a bag by Men's Health.​""The best snack in a bag. Twiglets are packed with whole wheat, B vitamins and anti-inflammatory celery seed.""​It's healthy but idk if it's affordable haha. HR buys them for the company.​Other favourites would include:AlmondsCashewsGrapesYoghurtGranola​​0 comments0"
