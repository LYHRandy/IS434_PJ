1,"Tai Zhi, Chief Investment Officer at AutowealthLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 04 Mar 2019This really depends on the personal financial circumstances, which significantly differs from person to person. Consider two persons, both having a basic monthly salary of S$3,000. What if one of them comes from a well-to-do family background which offers a safety net? What if one of them is working for a company/industry which is gloomy and may cause him/her to be retrenched in the near future? What if one of them have a six-figure bank savings already?Therefore, pls allow me to just share generically what is the common trend we see for investments after advising thousands & thousands of clients and managing their investments.Most would invest their available capital after setting aside some rainy day funds. Most would also commit to a monthly/quarterly regular investment plan. The majority of these investors commit around 10% of their monthly salary. Affluent and accredited clients, whose monthly salary is above S$5,000 and S$25,000 respectively, tend to invest almost 20% of their monthly salary.For insurance, you may wish to consider other perspectives as they may have better knowledge and experience than I do.0 comments0"
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Everyone have different situation in life so its hard to give a definite answer. Usually people set aside 2%-5% into insurance which can be more if you have to buy more coverage for whatever reason. A good insurance agent will make sure you dont overbuy and have adequate coverage. For savings and insurance, the more you allocate, the more it will benefit you. Dont limit yourself to a percentage instead for higher the better.0 comments0"
