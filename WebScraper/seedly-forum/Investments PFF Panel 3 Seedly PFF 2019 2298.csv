If we could all time the market well, we would be millionaires, and there wouldn't be a need for Financial Analysts and brokers any longer!I think the best thing to do is to evaluate the company's value - is the company's current stock price in the market lower or higher than your calculated intrinsic value? if it's lower, then no matter what the price will eventually go to this intrinsic value according to your calculation - it's a buy! if it's the other way round, then you could possibly short the stock as you anticipate an eventual fall in price as investors start to not see the value in the stock and sell off.If not, perhaps Dollar cost averaging can help you as it removes the need to time the market completely - your good buys balance our your bad buys, so eventually the price averages out.That being said, there is no need to be eager to jump right in! evaluate what you want to buy, read the news, get enough supporting evidence to show that the firm will do as well as you believe it will, before you invest. You can really see a much better chance of profits in this way!0 comments2"

The market starts turning down. How do you know when to enter the market? At 10 percent people are saying that it's a correction and it's normal. 20 percent more people say it's now a downturn, but those invested in it tell you not to worry and that the market is resilient. Before long it's 50 percent down. By now you start thinking maybe it's a falling knife, so you'll wait. Before long the market has recovered by 20 percentage points and you think you've missed the boat.0 comments2"
