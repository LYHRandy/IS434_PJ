2,"SYSamuel Yip27 Jun 2019Pick a sector that you have an interest in. Ranging from real estate, tech companies, manufacturing, oil and gas, banks. Choose a sector that intrigues you the most. Start off from there and then you can either choose to go the FA or TA route. Having an interest will set you off with knowledge about the industry. This will give you a head start rather than random picks. Hope this helps."
