MasterAnswered on 02 Jan 2019Just saying eToro might be CFD trading (contract for difference) not stock trading they are different. I cant help you as i have no knowledge about it. Better do your research first before buying. Starting amount is low might be good but just make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.0 comments0"

Follow a rule: If you dont understand, dont follow.There are many useful and free resources online (books, blogs, articles and the myriad) you can refer to to pick up investing. Alternatively, you can opt for ETFs which requires monthly investment of at least $100. Keep in mind to do your own research first before starting.As for eToro, it is safe. eToro deals mainly with CFD (a derivative product which relies heavily on leveraging, meaning losses can be massive). Again, if you don't understand the product, don't go there. Start of with conventional equities. When you're familiar with the system, then you can start exploring futures and derivatives.0 comments0"
