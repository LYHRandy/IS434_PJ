question,Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 25 Nov 2018I was recommended by my agent to get the Prulife multiplier flex for early critical illness coverage. She said that this can complement my current ILP that has CI rider. What do you guys recommend? Hi all! I was recommended by my agent to get the prulife multiplier flex for early critical illness coverage. She said that this can complement my current ILP that has CI rider. When the ILP cost of insurance gets too high I can choose to terminate and fall back on this as my main coverage. Is this true? What do you guys recommend? I earn about 4K/month. Currently have an ILP which Iâ€™m paying $160/month and have a hospitalization plan as well.3 answersAnswerBump0

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Well, i have a couple of questions for you:1) Why did u purchase the ILP at the start?2) What was the purpose of your ILP?Based on what you have shared, your annual income is approximately S$48,000. In terms of CI coverage, it would be good to have 4 - 5x of your annual income as CI coverage. Hence, I would suggest that u cover $50,000 to S$100,000 in ECI and another S$150,000 in CI Coverage.As for what kind of plans for your coverage, it really depends on your overall budget, and preferences. For ECI, i would strongly suggest that you stick to a Whole Life Plan rather than term plans unless you can easily invest the difference to generate at least 5 - 6% annually.As for CI, it would be good to have it as a rider to a term plan, since ILPs arent the most efficient way to provide coverage for CI.You may reach out to me via Facebook https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chen should you have any further questions6 comments0"
3,"See all 6 comments Question Poster26 Nov 2018Or will a term plan be more suitable? Brandan Chen27 Nov 2018For ECI coverage, a whole life plan would be cheaper in the long term. For CI, a term plan would be more value for money. I can show you the excel calculations if you would like. The assumption is that you would invest the rest of the money on your own.

CI coverage is pretty much essential, and more so if you have a family history, you smoke, or drink more than usual. Perhaps it would be good if you can drop me an e... (more)"

Since u know u would want CI coverage till then and u are not very tight on budge now.Personally, I do not like whole life, ILP and 'early CI' plans. Especially ILP has a very high cost structure, it is very not worth. The explanations can be rather lengthy to write here. I urge u to contact me on my facebook. Allow me to understand your coverage, and I would be able to offer a much cost effective solution for u. I am very confident u will benefit greatly.0 comments0"
