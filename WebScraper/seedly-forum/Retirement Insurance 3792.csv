1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Jun 2019Some things you might need to consider are:1) The policy owners protection scheme provides for a protection of up to S$100K per insurer. In the unlikely event that an insurer fails, your maximum payout is capped at that amount.2) Projected returns: While we know that they are just projections, it can give you an idea of what to expect.3) Other benefits: Some plans have additional benefit such as additional payouts should disability strike. You also need to consider how this integrates into your overall planning as you will also have other income sources such as CPF LIFE/stocks/UT/rental income, and other forms of disability protection such as eldershield/careshield.4) Guaranteed returns: For a similar payout, which policy would be the most cost effective?5) What would be your overall strategy and dreams for your retirement? Do you plan your initial years to be full of travel, where you might need more income, or are you worried about increasing costs with time, where a 'layering' strategy to combat inflation would be needed?I would say all these factors are important and you will have to weigh them all before making your final decision.

God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Hi Anon, I see that you're worried about insurer default. In that case, SDIC will cover up to $100k on a policy.But personally, I think I'll just go for the highest guaranteed and highest IRR policy. If you have two policies giving you almost equal IRR, then sure split between both. But don't settle for a lesser IRR just because you might afraid of the insurer going bust. There are strict rules in place for insurers here by MAS, and even in the even of an insurer leaving Singapore, they'll still service your policy or another insurer will take over the portfolio.0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019If you are looking strictly into plan, as a layman perspective I will go for at least 2 different insurer.You might want to consider exploring the following too:1) Top up SRS yearly $15,3002) Top up CPF-SA yearly $70003) Top up CPF-MA (If applicable for tax relief)4) Buy into Dividend paying stocks (i.e. REITs, blue chips).0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 06 Jun 2019Well, if you are referring to a Guaranteed Payout from the retirement plans, there is actually not too much of a difference from the Guaranteed payout point of view.However, different insurers do have different features within their Retirement/Annuity products. For example, since I represent Manulife, our retirement product does provide you with an additional payout should you be unable to perform 2 out of 6 ADLs.Another factor to consider is also the long term performance of the participating fund since most retirement plans out there are PAR products. Although most insurers have been paying at their projected rate of 4.75% on most years, past performance doesn't equate to future performance. Hence, diversifying may be a good option if you are looking at the projected numbers.Ultimately, the choice lies with yourself, and whether the particular advisor is able to provide you with sound advice regarding retirement planning.Should you like to have a better understanding of Manulife's retirement plans, or have a alternative opinion of your current retirement strategy. Feel free to drop me a PM on my facebook and we can have a coffee chat. (Coffee's on me for sure) https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chen0 comments0"
