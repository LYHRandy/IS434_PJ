God of WisdomAnswered on 21 Sep 2019Key things to take note (not in any particular order):Improve your human capital. Your earning capacity can be greatly increased by improving your skillset in the early years and that will greatly boost your ability to reach your financial goals later.Prepare an emergency fund. I'd recommend at least 12 months of expenses. Then prepare a warchest for investment opportunities. Build them over time. Rome was not built overnight.Settle your insurance needs. Death/CI/Hospitalization is probably what most need. I've responded a number of times on this issue and you can browse through my answers to read the details. Your youth is still on your side as premiums only go up when you get older. Don't wait too long to settle this. You buy insurance with health. You pay with money. There's a difference there.Read up and gain knowledge of investments. If you are just graduating, you still have a good 30+ years ahead of you. Don't rush in first. Take the time (but not too much time!) to get a feel of what instruments suit you.Find an advisor whom you can speak to. Someone you can trust to dispense the right advice to you in your interest. Someone you are comfortable to speak to with regards to your financial goals and aspirations.Aim to control expenses in the early stages of your career. That Frappucino may seem tempting, but kopi peng will do the same thing if you just want a cool drink and a caffeine kick. It's called delayed gratification.Examine yourself and ask what you want to achieve financially. Having the beginnings of a plan now will make it easier to have a final goal crystalize in time.There's a lot more that can be said, but these 7 pointers should be a good start. I wish you all the best in your journey!0 comments7"
2,"Lim Boon Tat, Mathematics at Cambridge UniversityLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Sep 2019A couple of different facets:(1) focus on getting a high-income skill/job. With more income, it’s slightly easier to save/invest more. (2) Read more financial books. Read a book a month, for a year. You’re young and there’s no need to rush into it.  (3) Start a virtual investment portfolio. Plenty of apps for you to do this. Start to understand if you find it interesting enough to research companies and stock pick, or whether you are more suited for a passive investing approach.0 comments2"
