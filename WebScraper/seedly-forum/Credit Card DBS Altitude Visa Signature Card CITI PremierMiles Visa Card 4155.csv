1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Personal opinion, keep both. Both allows you to ""buy"" miles when you pay the annual fee and the miles don't expire, so you can slowly accmulate towards your dream redemption.Besides, if you only have these 2 cards, DBS Altitude Card allows you to earn 3mpd when you buy air tickets and book hotels online, so that helps to boost your miles earning rate.0 comments1"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Need to think about why you want such cards in the first place. If it is to gain miles quickly then both are equally good, since the accrual rates are essentially the same and both offer 10k miles if you pay the annual fee. I'm keeping both to get the bonus miles with the fees, but using the BOC elite miles card as the daily card as it has a better accrual rate.2 comments0"
