question,"Savings Fresh Graduates Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Nov 2018How do I calculate my returns for STI ETF if I'm investing into it each month via a Regular Savings Plan (RSP) & DCA?Hi I'm currently investing into STI ETF via POSB Invest Saver. Using the DCA method, with a monthly contribution of $150 per month. I would like to know how to calculate my returns on my STI ETF investments, could you advise how? Using Excel to track my investment, I'm currently using: Face Value of Total Shares (S$) - Total Amount Invested Including Fees (S$) to get my Return of Investment (S$). Returns (%) is then ROI (S$) / Total Amt Invested (S$). Can you tell me if / why this is wrong?1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterUpdated on 14 Nov 2018I'm not sure how this ""Face Value of Total Shares (S$) - Total Amount Invested Including Fees (S$) to get my Return of Investment (S$)."" works cuz 'Face Value of Total Shares' refers to the original price of the stock to my understanding.For instance, NIKKO AM STI ETF has fixed gross sales charge of 0.82% which you can multiply by $150 (example) per n number of months (sales charge). Then using Excel, you can track average price bought. Compare it with current price - sales charge and you get an idea whether you have paper gain/loss. If you want to take into account of dividends, it'll be more complicated but you can just less from accumulating sales charge.0 comments1"
