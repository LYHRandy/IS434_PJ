1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Feb 2019Hey there!Just to add another perspective to your question! When you mentioned "" So essential its like parking your money in a long term 'bond'/perpetual and getting coupon of X%/yr."", you are right in the sense if company has constant and sustainable dividend pay-out ratio. However, one fundamental difference between bonds and equities is that for equity owners, you are entitled to the residual earnings of the company in the form of dividend payments (which also means that you may get none if the company did not do well financially). On the other hand, bond holders are entitled to fixed income in the form of interest payments. On this note, the returns for bonds is irregardless of the stock price but it is erraneous to assume that dividend yield is tantamount to ""a long term 'bond'/perpetual and getting coupon of X%/yr."" 0 comments3"
2,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hello! Here’s a brief response to your question.First, it depends on whether the company can even sustain giving dividends in the long term, and what is the dividend pay-out policy of the company. Has the company been paying dividends for a long time, or has it recently been paying dividends only? Also, pay attention to a company’s cashflow. If the company does not have enough cash on hand for its operating requirements, then it may stop paying dividends after a while so that it can fund its operations. You can look at a company’s cashflow by looking at the Cashflow Statement found it its annual or quarterly financial reports.Second, do look at a company’s share price as well! If you can sell the share and make a healthy capital gain (the gain from selling a share higher than when you bought it), then you might consider this alternative. If you would prefer a portfolio that pays more dividends, then the gains from this sale could help you to buy more shares with a steady dividend pay-out too.Third, what do analysts and other investors say about this company’s share? Do the others see it as an investment for the share’s dividend yield, or for selling the shares? Seeing what other investors think may help you frame your thought process also.2 comments3"

MasterAnswered on 05 Feb 2019For me, I'll still monitor the counter here and there to see if it can be sold for a good profit for eg a year or more's worth of dividends. I did this recently for the mapletree commercial odd lot that I was dca-ing into since last year. Took money off the table and wait for the price to drop to a more reasonable level, or use it for another opportunity somewhere else. But this is me; your line of thinking is not wrong as well if you don't wish to do active monitoring and want to build a dividend portfolio for the long term. 0 comments2"
5,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Feb 2019It is not advisable to just buy a stock for dividend and forget about it.Dividend policy is not guaranteed. It can be cut anytime, or maybe even go to 0.Asian Pay TV Trust is one good example. At one point it had almost 20% dividend yield! Dividends were not sustainable, price dropped, and eventually they cut dividends. Those who didnt get out fast enough got burnt badly.Hyflux bonds another example. Most people think bonds sure get payouts and capital is quite safe since not much price fluctuations. But bond companies also can go bankrupt or get into super bad debt.0 comments1"
6,"Lee JiahuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Feb 2019Wrong. The bisiness prospects matter at all times, regardless of the price and yield. The yield matters when you calculate the price to buy or sell. E.g. sph price is heading downhill, still pays dividends, but can buy if price is right. 0 comments1"
7,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Starhub pays 9% of dividend but they borrow money to pay shareholders their dividends. You should definitely not ignore for long term. If every year dividend payout and stock prices drops together, you wont make much out of it.1 comment1"
