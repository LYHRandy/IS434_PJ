question,"Insurance Investments AMA SG Budget Babe Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Aug 2018What are the good choices for insurance and investment products for expats living in SG?A DBS agent is trying to sell me the insurance (25-year plan) and investment products (5-year plan). Are these good? Should I be looking out for the same products from other banks before deciding to invest with her?My condition is I am an expat living in SG. I thought it might be easier to invest with DBS since I already have a bank account with them. And, one day, if I decide to leave the country, it would be better to have all the investment plans under the same bank for easy monitoring and in case I need to transfer the money. However, I have no clue if their products would give me good return or be worth the investment or not.2 answersAnswerBump2"

Without seeing the policy of what he's trying to sell you, I cannot comment on whether these are good (and probably won't / shouldn't either, you should speak to a licensed financial advisor instead).​I highly suspect the investment product comes with many hidden costs though. See this for more: http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2016/06/how-paying-1-in-investment-fees-giving.html​Expats or locals in Singapore, I don't think investing makes a difference. I personally prefer the stock market and investing direct eg. via SGX. But this also depends on your time and tool. Withdrawing shouldn't be too much for an issue regardless of what method you pick! :)0 comments2"
