3,"Steph YeoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 19 Jul 2018If you're alr taking many courses that interest you, how do we effectively recommend more courses for you ah idk. Revisit your intention: What do you want to achieve w going for so many courses? Also, evaluate effectiveness: Are you applying anything from the courses you've taken?I find short term courses good for a touch and go introduction of main concepts but not so helpful for indepth mastery of the topic. Anything you've taken that has interested you enough to perhaps do further studies? Or make a difference in the society e.g. providing massages for the elderly or taking photos for charities?But i guess it could help to learn sth usually out of your comfort zone/interest, you could find a new love!0 comments0"
