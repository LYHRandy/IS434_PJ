question,"Family Lifestyle Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Jul 2019How do you split bills between siblings?We are all currently single and give our parents a different amount of allowance every month. We are looking to take over the bills in the house (internet, utilities etc.) and would like to know the best way to split it among us. Should we create a joint account for that OR get 1 of us to pay first before the rest pays him back?2 answersAnswerBump1"

WizardUpdated on 23 Jul 2019Perhaps just leave it as it is but each one pay your parents half the combined bill amount in addition to the allowance.That way saves the trouble of joint accounts, setting up the giro, changing the billing account etc.1 comment0"
