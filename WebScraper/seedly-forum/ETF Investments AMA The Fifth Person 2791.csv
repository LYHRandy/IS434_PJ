1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi,I uses the Bloomberg app to guage the index valuation using PE ratio. In general, the average PE range for all index ETF is around 15x. If the index is trading below 10x then I deemed it as cheap. Few months ago, the Hang Seng index was trading below PE 10x which i think is cheap so I bought some Hang Seng ETF for my wife.3 comments0"

But also look at political risk for the country...Russia is really cheap currently but I wouldnt touch it!"
