question,"Lifestyle General Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Nov 2018Is having kids a privilege only for the rich?World tells is that sustaining life and creating life always revolves around money. But how true can this be? Can a low wage employee actually raise a family. After all, life is certainly more valuable that the numbers in our bank account. Of course thereâ€™s a sense of responsibility to consider. But sometimes it seems like we devalue life to a mere transaction.1 answerAnswerBump0"

While, yes, the rich are more able to care for the child materialistically, they are just not procreating. Au contraire, Niger (a country in Africa) has the world's highest fertility rate at 6.62 per woman. Of course, it doubtfully is far from an empirical claim -- does not take into account rape, lack of awareness of protection. In different societies, an offspring is treated quite differently. In a developed nation, couple strive to progress in the career more so in an increasingly egalitarian Asian society where women are making strides away from kitchen towards their aspirations. Having kids would just hinder their persuits and they do not have time to care for them (quite true in a duel-income household in Singapore). However for a family that's less well off, there may be intrinsic and extrinsic value behind it. Breeding enables continuation of family lines in families where tradition is deeply rooted. For some, being together with children provides them with more joy than what they could possibly get with material gains. For others, having more children increases the chance of them having better golden years with many taking care for them. Well for some, it's just poor family planning. It's not a 'privilege' per se, it just depends on what you want.2 comments0"
