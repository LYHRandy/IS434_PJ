1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jan 2019I applied my debit card by myself at 16 lol. I applied my student credit card by myself at 21 lol. If i had kids, i would teach them how to use it properly, the consequence of not paying credit card bills and ask them apply themselves when they reached the age. I have no idea why a 14 years old kid will need a credit card overseas when they should have adults accompanying them.0 comments0"
