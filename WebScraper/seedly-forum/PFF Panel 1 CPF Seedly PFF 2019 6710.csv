ProdigyAnswered 4d agoHi Anon, I'm assuming you're refering to SA instead of RA as mentioned in your question.Personally, I would not advice on that unless you are very certain that you are not going to buy a property in Singapore and going to retire in Malaysia for sure.I would suggest that you should still keep the money in your OA where it is, in case your plans change where you decide to buy a property in Singapore, as you can't reverse the transfer.Alternatively, you can consider investing your OA monies for higher returns. There are many products in the market that you can consider. Do take note that investments are non guaranteed and there will be charges involved.0 comments1"
