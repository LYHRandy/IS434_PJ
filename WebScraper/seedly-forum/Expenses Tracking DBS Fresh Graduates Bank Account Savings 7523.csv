question,"Expenses Tracking DBS Fresh Graduates Bank Account Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Nov 2018Do you recommend creating a separate savings account for discretionary spendings?I'm currently using DBS Multiplier and my spendings account is my POSB Savings / CIMB Fastsaver. Since the interest rates of POSB & CIMB are a lot lower, I've taken to move most of my money to DBS Multiplier, leaving around $1k-$1.5k in my POSB Savings for daily expenses.Read some advice on creating a separate account so I can budget for these spendings (e.g. travels, splurges). But the trade-off will be having these budgeted amounts earn low interest :( What would you suggest?1 answerAnswerBump0"
