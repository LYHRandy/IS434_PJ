1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 08 Mar 2019Singapore Savings Bonds are a good choice. You can reconsider CPF top ups once you are very sure that you will not need the money for many years. Like maybe after you bought a flat, married, wedding done, etc and you have spare cash.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 31 Oct 2018You can consider putting it in CIMB FastSaver which gives 1% interest per annum, a Fixed Deposit account (Currently CIMB offering 1.84% for 12 months until the end of this month) or Singapore Savings Bonds. As for topping up your parents' CPF, it depends on yourself since it'll be locked in until your parents reach 55 and the money will enjoy 4% interest per annum which gets compounded over time. 0 comments0"
