question,Property Investments REITs SeedlyTV EP05 Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 May 2019What are the downsides of investing in industrial properties compared to residential properties?I came across this article on Soho: https://sohoapp.com/users/jon-jon-974615/posts/103082 which reported that industrial properties have a whopping 5% rental yield compared to the 2.5% for residential (sounds too good to be true). Can we use CPF to pay for industrial properties? Do we need a bigger cash outlay? Thank you.2 answersAnswerBump0

MasterAnswered on 31 May 2019Here are some cons that investing in industrial properties bring:A.Time InvestmentIf you own an industrial building with more than one tenant, it is likely that you will have more to responsibility than with a residential building. Basically, not everything can fall onto your tenant shoulders, it is your responsibility as well.B.Bigger initial investmentInvesting in a commercial property usually requires more capital up front than if you were to invest in a residential rental in the same area, this might be a sigificant blocker to most people C. More risksIndustrial properties are believed to have more public visitors and therefore have more people on the property each day which increases the chances of someone getting hurt or do something to damage the property.0 comments2"
