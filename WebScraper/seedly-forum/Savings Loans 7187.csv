question,Savings Loans Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Oct 2018I can afford to pay for my University tuition fees fully. Does it make sense to still take up a bank loan to earn extra interest?Was thinking to take up a study bank loan and use the money to put it in a high interest Fixed Deposit account and earn the interest then repay the loan fully before I graduate? It'll still be interest free and I'll get to earn additional interest from the loan amount.7 answersAnswerBump2

If you can generate a higher return than the loan interest, you take it for as long as you can.If the loan interest is 0, then you definitely take it. Cash is king. 0 comments4"
2,"NWNg Wah ChunLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You might want to consider dragging the repayment as long as you can as a 4.75% 'loan' is quite cheap, for retail (not hard to get returns above that) - speaking from my own experience1 comment0"
3,"Question Poster17 Dec 2018Thanks for your input but returns from investments are not guaranteed so I wouldn't take any chances, would rather clear off the study loan first (Able to repay in full)"
