1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2018hiNo worries. In SG, we have the best community and support by government for startup. ​No $, no problem. Suggest after NS, work and save some $ too because it's always needed to put in some own $. ​Few pathway i would suggest:Go back to your poly, find out from the info side any incubator for startup, they will link you up to mentor, angel investor (or sometimes is even your poly itself) and the people who are also interested to start a biz.Most important steps: Networking. You need to network to: (a) Find co-founders (because if you're biz but not tech, it won't work. If you're tech but you also can't cope with just biz because you'll have no time to do all well. So you need co-founder. (b) Test your ideas and learn how to pitch: Network allows you to learn how to talk / pitch to strangers, the most basic and important steps of any startup founders. It also allows you to talk to stranger about your ideas, bounds idea around as they might brinig a different perspective to you so that you can further develop and further mature your ideas. Otherwise it will just stay in your brain as an imaginary ideas. Don't worry about people stealling your ideas, its' all about the executions. They can steal but may not have the persistency to continue and bring the idea to real fruitations.(C) Find fundings / investor:  Network allows you find the right support that will leads you to the suitable Angel investor for a start and subsequenty also the mentorship on running the startup since nobody was born to know how to run a startup but also same as everyone else, learn on the job. You can join : http://www.ntuc.org.sg/ustartup/ They provides linking to the right people, networking  and  you can expand from there and find out more. ​Young NTUC also may have some good opportunities of similar mindset looking to start a biz /ideas: ​https://www.youngntuc.org.sg/wps/portal/ydu2/home/aboutus/!ut/p/a1/04_Sj9CPykssy0xPLMnMz0vMAfGjzOK9LFzdPZyDDbwsHAMMDBy9g93MvS2cjB1djYEKIoEKDHAARwNC-sP1o8BK8JhQkBthkO6oqAgA0ZoLrw!!/dl5/d5/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SmlFL1o2X1BMT0lFRkgyMDhURUEwSUxGMDRFMTNQRDI2/​Happy Starting up! ​0 comments0"

4,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018No money then find part time and save up. Im planning to save $15,000 for NSYou can check the linkhttps://blog.seedly.sg/national-service-ns-how-much-can-one-save/Even if i dun get into ocs or scs, i will try to do guard duty around once a month for $100 each time which can earn me $2400. Then also be frugal with my spending during ns since food is paid, transport not going to be often. Going out during book out wont be very often as well because NS also tiring. If you aim for officer and do guard duty every week, you can reduce your spending and save a lot. Or you can even do part time tutoring but do remember you are not supposed to work during 2 years in NS so dont get caught.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Hey, I used to study in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and I understand that the Sandbox has a Startup Incubator programme for potential entrepreneurs / students with business ideas. You need to pitch your idea and if it's viable, they provide you with funding and space to execute your idea. I'm not sure if it's open to all but you can check it out and contact them to enquire more! https://www.np.edu.sg/thesandbox/Pages/incubator.aspxBut generally, you'll need backing from investors to fund the execution of your idea0 comments0"

8,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Find someone, a mentor, who has been running his/her own business for a period of time and run through your idea. Someone you really can trust. Buy lunch for him/her and show them your idea and ask for opinion on your plan first and of there are any areas that may be improved on. Or if they are unsure cos it's not their area of expertise, see if they know someone that does. Hope this helps, and all the best 0 comments0"
