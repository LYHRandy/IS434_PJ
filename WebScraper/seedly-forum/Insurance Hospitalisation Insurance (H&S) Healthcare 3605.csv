question,"Insurance Hospitalisation Insurance (H&S) Healthcare Asked by AnonymousAsked 3d agoWhat are some other insurance coverage for my 63yo mum, apart from hospitalisation and saving plans?I would like to get some insurance coverage for my 63yo mum. She is currently on a proper coverage for hospitalisation plan. I'm not keen on saving plans as we already have other plans. Would it be advisable for me to get ""Allianz Cancer Protect"" for her as it would provide income in the event if she is diagnosed with cancer? The idea is to provide sustainable management of the cost of living as the elderly are prone to illnesses.4 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered 3d agoHi Anon, you can look at the NTUC Silver series of plans as well as considering upgrading her Eldershield to a supplement plan to provide a lifetime payout in the event of disability for long term care costs.You may also want to consider a lifetime guaranteed annuity policy to provide her with a stream of income for life, there are some policies that would double the payout in the event of disability as well.0 comments3"
2,"Alvin TeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2d agoI would like to tackle your question head on and say that providing income in event she is diagnosed with cancer as important as providing coverage for treatment as your Mum is 63 and might be retiring in two years time, her savings and financial planning previously done should cover for this. And the income coverage is only for 12 months. Thing is with these plans is a lot of things has to happen for it to “benefit” the life assured. I’ve seen some said getting term plan for your Mum, intuitively it seems wrong to take up term plans at 63. Instead, take up MerdekaCare from income as it is renewable for life and now got promo to get massager (next year birthday gift settled!)Elderly are prone to accidents too. In the point of providing sustainable management of old age you have to plan around the risks involved, critical illness; longevity (yes, living too long is a risk); spouse passing on; etc.Do speak to an independent financial advisor such as myself to see through plans across multiple insurers (My company not backed by any of them, so I do not need to specifically favor them). Another form of management of cost is also coming up with proper LPA/AMD/Will, which effectively pens down your mum’s intention. For this, I can assist as well, this I’m not affiliated with the usual companies that charges a few hundred so that the advisors get rebates from there, no point in doing so.0 comments1"

As for insurance coverage, my advice is focus on getting a good annuity plan for her instead. Focus on the constant stream of income vs a payout from insurance.0 comments1"

WonderkidUpdated 3d agoHi Anon,Allianz Cancer protect is good if your mother has health issues and might run into underwriting issues when applying for insurance as it is guaranteed issuance.However, do take note that this only covers invasive and non-invasive cancers.You might want consider taking up a term plan with insurers which covers up to 37 CI and adjust the lumpsum payout accordingly to prepare for future expenses.Eldershield can also be upgraded if you have not done so for her yet0 comments0"
