1,"Nicholas Woon, Marketing Director at ERA Realty Network Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 24 Sep 2018I would listen to my clients’ concerns and ask them questions to find out more to see how their thought process flows. If you don’t know your clients well, it is very difficult to tailor a solution for them! ​I’d also be very honest in my advice. I would not recommend a strategy/house if I wouldn’t do it given their taste/preference & constraints. ​I have also find that during closings, some people might face tremendous fear in a big commitment. It is important to be human and empathize with them while reassuring that they are making the right decision (with all the statistics/reasoning). ​It is very common to get rejections. While it helps when you reflect what went wrong each time, sometimes you have to understand that it might not be your fault and the client may not be sharing all his concerns with you (ie. he/she might not be ready). ​Lastly, if you use your heart and be genuine throughout, your clients would definitely know and appreciate you. Thats how we build trust and grow your business! 0 comments0"

4,Jeff Yeo23 Sep 2018Actually as a sales person in any industry they would not review the Comm. It is the job of a sales person to influence the decision of the customer. Sales people who can’t do that are not good sales people.

God of WisdomAnswered on 23 Sep 2018My best sales advice is that sales is a process.It's a process to get your customer to acknowledge he has a problem, how painful that problem is, how great it would be to get that problem solved, presenting your solution to that problem, getting him to agree it does solve the problem, acknowledging and handling all objections, and asking for the close. 0 comments0"
