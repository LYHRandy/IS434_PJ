1,"SKShabir KhanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 18 Mar 2019You could try DBS Regular Savings Plan, investing in ABF Bond Index ETF, which comprises of Bonds issued by the Government of Singapore. Which makes it practically risk-free, DBS RSP also charges  a low fee of 0.5%, reducing fees and they are highly liquid, Yield is currently at 2.33%, paid annually, making for decent returns. Only thing to watch out for would be price fluctuation, although it is very
 small with the Bond ETF.PS: I think at the moment they have a promotion where the service fee of 0.5% will be refunded if applied for by end of march.0 comments1"
