1,"Devanshi Singh, Investment Planner, Writer, Adviser  at Financial Advisory ServicesLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019First of all congratulations!I guess you are talented than you think and you worrying too much. I can uderstand high paying job as compare to your current job can be overwhelming. I also had that kind of situation few months before but yeah your situation is far more seious as your baby faughter is just 6 months old.I would suggest first talk to your family with whom you live becasue they will be most affected with your decisions of going to other country and for 2 years.Secondly, how is your family's financial situation? Is it extremely difficult to survive in current salary? If not; then you can hold that for now. And if it is difficult then first talk to your present school if they can give you increment, now that you have better offer.Third, If I were you I would have chose to see my daughter growing. This wont come again but job offer can come again. I know you also want that but it won't be easy to shift wih your family and it would be tough to not seeing her face everyday when you reach home.So you can priorities your choice and chose accordingly.I hope my answer helped you little bit.2 comments2"

3,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 03 Dec 2018As far as I see it, nothing beats the importance of family. What does your husband think about this too? My take is to stick around and raise your daughter first, if the salary is an issue, perhaps talk to the school and see if they are willing to give you more responsibilities for a pay increment. Opportunities to teach in Japan are aplenty and will not go away any time, you can always revisit that when your daughter is a little older, you can even plan around having her(possibly) be educated there as well? Though that sounds like a stretch either ways, I still think that it is important that you have to be there for your daughter first no matter what. Also, moving and settling back down in another country for work is not easy too, not to mention there are also living costs, rental for lodging etc to take into consideration. Importantly, discuss this with your husband and decide logically the next move. All the best! :)0 comments2"
4,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 03 Dec 2018From the info provided, i'd say choose your daughter.If you are not happy with your current pay, im sure there are plenty of local jobs that can pay you more without you having to travel to Japan and staying there for 2 years. Loads of options - don't be trapped into considering these as your only 2 options.Examples i can think of: private tuition, tuition centres, taking on tuition side jobs.0 comments1"
5,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Jan 2019Ooh is this the JET Programme! Such opportunities are hard to come by, so I can totally understand your dilemma. Would it be possible to relocate your family there for the 2 years? Because honestly there’s no better time to do it alr. Any later, your girl would grow up and need to start school, then it’ll be even harder for you to go.0 comments0"
6,Tina Sharon LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Dec 2018The tax rate in Japan is pretty high. If they don't tax equalise you likely you will be worse off. Also you can always give tuition on the side to make more cash. Lots of enrichment centres also look for teachers to help out on weekends etc. I would choose family coz you can never get back those experiences with any amount of money. Choose wisely.0 comments0
7,"Xinyi Lum, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Dec 2018So cool, congrats! I was just having this conversation amongst my friends. The general concensus was that moving to Japan was the ""better"" choice because of the supposed way of life. I would say only you would know best which option is better for you and your family :)0 comments0"
8,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Dec 2018I think you need to work out what your priorities are. In my opinion, family is for life. As for money, you can't bring them to your grave.If you are worried about money, I'd suggest carefully planning out your monthly budget to manage your expenses. If you have money to spare, do some form of investments. Seedly has lots of resources to share regarding this!0 comments0"
