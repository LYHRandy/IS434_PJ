question,"Salary Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Dec 2018I was given an unfair review at work that will probably affect my pay. How do I handle this? I love my job, and am even willing to work overtime?This year the number of clients grew by 3 times, and my co-worker quit. Because we did not have new hires, I was forced to work 16hrs a day just to be able to meet all the demands. However because of the workload, I could not handle all requests on time and thus it caused some complains from clients. My CEO was notified of this and thus I received a very bad review.4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Vicky FaithLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Dec 2018I guess it could also be an opportunity for you to start ""reviewing"" (aka reflecting) your job. Cause it's a two way thing. We dont sell our lives to job to be fully utilised without being paid the right sum, at the same time, we dont take a large amount of money and do nothing. One thing I realise about working is working over time and keeping silent about the amount of workload I have doesn't help. In the reality, some other people who are more vocal yet still leaves work on time gets the credit (and the money) instead. Below are some of my thoughts, from my bare minimum working experience: 1) speak to your CEO, provided your organisation is open to such communication in the first place. Ie, your CEO is someone who did see your work before, know who you are and what you do (at least on the surface). If not, I doubt speaking to the CEO will help because your direct boss has the upper hand of telling the CEO the ""truth"" and you speaking to him only gonna make things more difficult for you. 2) if point 1 dont work, try speaking to your direct boss. Use the hamburger approach to always show your appreciation and thanks for the opportunities given for you to grow and learn in the organisation (hopefully that's true!) And share your concern as a mature adult, and dont seems like you're complaining. Dont use the ""I"" all the time to prove you're doing a lot, do more of the ""we"" nexus you may not know how how much OT did your direct boss actually does as well to meet demand too. If you wanna use ""I"",  dont forget to add on the ""you too"" to show how you're looking at big picture. 3) if point 1 and 2 doesn't make sense, probably it's time to review your job instead. Get it over and done with the unfair review and start searching for a job that worth your contribution (based on the fact that you're actually out performing on your usual job scope). I'm saying this selfishly that money can be secondary and job satisfaction to be first. If your priorities are different, this pointer may not work as well. Then before performing pointer 3, take out a paper and pen and start writing down what's your priorities in life so you will know what's the best next step for you. If you do either pointer 1 or 2, it means you really value your job. And if that's the case, fight for it and dont be silent about any unfair treatment, as long as those ""unfair treatment"" you mentioned are really unfair in all eyes, not just yours. After I changed my job recently, I realised the importance of separating my work life and personal life apart. I realised working longer hours doesn't help me with my personal life and stopped me from doing a lot more things I wished I could do. I'm saying this in a perspective of being an employed person by a company - i do understand why entrepreneurs work long hours in order to build their company after all.Unfortunately, i do know of some companies that require every division to give at least one person to be the ""no performance bonus"" person in order to have like a range of good to bad. It's like they are indirectly encouraging to let the bad staff to stay so that the good staff can shine. Quite a stupid policy but it does exist. Good luck! :) 0 comments2"
2,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Jan 2019Is there an avenue to appeal? Use it, and justify using your hard work. However be prepared that the response could be sth like, “if you were struggling why didn’t you bring it up in the first place?”I hope your appeal succeeds. Regardless, take this as a lesson learnt, don’t allow yourself to be put in an unfavourable position at work. It’s an Asian thing to silently struggle at work and hope that hard work pays off, but many times it’s really not like that. Speak up, and your work situation may improve!All the best!0 comments0"
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Dec 2018Let your superior know what you are struggling with. Failure to handle everything on your plate does not reflect well on you either. If you let your superior know, at least he/she knows that you are working very hard and have a lot on your plate.0 comments0"
4,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Dec 2018Go talk to the CEO. If they are good and fair, they will really look into both side of story. if they maintain the stand and was blinded,  if you love your job and they are not treating you fairly, it is better you go to somewhere that you like and will appreciate your contributions and work hard there rather. :) 0 comments0"
