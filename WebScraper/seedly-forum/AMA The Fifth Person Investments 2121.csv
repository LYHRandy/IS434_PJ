You should save up more money.Make sure you save up at least 6 month of monthly expense as an emergency fund. Anything excess then you have the right to invest in the market. 0 comments1"

With $0: Start investing in your own financial knowledge:Read forums for financial knowledge. SeekingAlpha, MotleyFool, Seedly etc.Read quality news: Financial Times etc (subject to paywall)Read books on both Value Investing and investments in general. Assuming you are based in Singapore, our National Library is a good place to start.With $100, if you really want to start investing with small sums: You can start investing with as little as $100 with Monthly Investment Plans for a start. Some to look at are:POSB Invest SaverOCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan (BCIP)Maybank Kim Eng Monthly Investment PlanPhillip Share Builder Plan0 comments0"
