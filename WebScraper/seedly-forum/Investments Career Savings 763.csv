Grand MasterAnswered on 26 Jul 2019First off, kudos to you on starting your financial journey early. There are many products out there that are similar and competitive with Manulife Ready Builder 20. The plans out there are all similar and competitive in their own right. Choose a good agent, someone you are comfortable with rather than the plan.And seeing that you are going to army soon. My advice will be to build up on your cash savings more than putting a larger amount into any wealth accumulation plans out there.I came out of Army with an additional savings of about 10k and I think thats a very good amount to have as a goal.An integrated shield plan with rider will help you to offset about 95% of your hospitalisation bills. You will want to get that, it will protect your money. 
You can also consider setting a small amount of money into an endowment plan. I set aside 1k a year only while I got my plan in army.So how to get to 10k. Commit an amount to save every month. This should grow as your allowance increases. Just saving 400/month on average will give you 9.6k after 2 years.Avoid canteen (seriously, the food is nothing special but just an illusion created cause we are in-camp) stick to cookhouse food. Avoid ninja van when out too. Don’t go ra-ra over nights off. Many NSF will spend more during nights off, don’t. In fact if my nights off are 3 hours only, I don’t even bother to go out. As much as you can, do not cab to camp. Just stick to public transport. If you have to cab to camp, share with someone else. Sell your time for duty. 
I do that and earn a few hundred bucks extra in the month. I use the time in camp to do reading too. But of course, I will have a bit less of social life. So balance that out accordingly.Basically, it’s just being aware of what you are spending on. And Army is a great opportunity to learn side skills (so work on what is crucial for you during those 2 years) and save (especially if you are stay-in like me)0 comments5"
