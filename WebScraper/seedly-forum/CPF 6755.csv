God of WisdomAnswered on 02 Sep 2019It would be better to top up with cash than use your own Medisave as you may need your Medisave in the future for your own needs.And however little her account may have, it'll still be earning a minimum 4% interest. So that 10k will be earning at least 400 per year. If you top up above the premium amount, that money will also generate an interest. :)0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 13 Sep 2019I think this is a complicated question depending on your financial situation is different.Do you require tax reliefs? If yes, it will be good to use yours and top up your own through voluntary contributions.If not, focus on her RA because this can be withdrawn, while MA is dead money.Cash is too useful in any situation. Do a proper financial plan if you can.You may contact me if you want a holistic planning. value.matrix@outlook.com0 comments1"
