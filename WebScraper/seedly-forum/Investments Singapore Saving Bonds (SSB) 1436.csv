question,"Investments Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 May 2019I am currently a university student with quite a sum of savings, what should I do?Over the past few years I have managed to run my own business and saved a sum of amount (~200K). I planned on doing dollar cost averaging on a portfolio of 70/30 equity/bonds as opposed to putting one lump sum in a portfolio(minimize risk). Hence my plan will be to park all my cash in SSB and transfer some of my fund from SSB to portfolio every 3 months. Is this wise? Will you guys have a diff approach?6 answersAnswerBump5"

1,"Christopher TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dear Anonymous, first of all, well done. You have really done well in your business. I think the strategy you have proposed is workable. But do note that dollar cost averaging generally do not work well in an up market. Of course, we do not know if the current market is sustainable. No one can guess. So if you feel comfortable doing what you have proposed, I think it's fine. For me, I will set aside enough for emergency fund into an SSB and with the rest of my money, I will invest 60-70% of it at one go and keep the rest as dry powder, just in case the market goes below 20%, I can invest a bit more but still for the long term and not to move in and out. But just make sure you don't get caught up with trying to time the market as very few people can do it right most of the time.

So perhaps an alternative for some of the money could be fixed deposits at banks, about 1.6% for a year, slightly lower interest but better liquidity if you wish to move often. Anyway. Also good to keep several pockets of lump sums for topup to your portfolio when market conditions are favourable â€“ so a mix of disciplined DCA & strategic lump sums.0 comments5"
