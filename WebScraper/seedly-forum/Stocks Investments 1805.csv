1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 05 Apr 2019I agree with you!Maybe because of online orders and delivery, I actually hardly eat directly at macs nowadays. And when I do, I actually prefer ordering through the counter even if the queue is longer. Maybe because of my experience since I was young, I actually enjoy the process of looking at the brightly lit neon boards and deciding between meal options instead of clicking on their screens. Pretty sure digitization for macs would save them loads operationally in manpower costs, but somehow i feel the service aspect of things is something I would miss greatly.0 comments1"
