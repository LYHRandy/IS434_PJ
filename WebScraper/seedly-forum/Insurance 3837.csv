1,"TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019So I'm actually looking to add on Critical Illness rider ($350k) @ $117.60/year and perhaps (?) Early CI rider ($300k) @ $86.40/year. Also i realised for term life coverage provided by aviva its a lot more expensive than personal accident. E.g for the same $600k coverage it'll cost $295.20/year as compared to accident which is only $77.04. Anyone knows why? If let's say I got into an accident and unfortunately passed away, both coverage pays out the same amount right?As for hospitalization coverage, I'm actually looking to get the Enhanced MediSheild coverage. What are your opinions?4 comments1"
