ProdigyUpdated on 23 Apr 2019REITs provides a cheaper and affordable access to benefit from property price increases and gives better than bank interest rates with higher returns on our savings over inflation. We don't have to see our savings eaten away by inflation and hdb price increases, while we are saving to buy our future hdb flat.Do take the time to learn about the performance indicators and comparison criterias of REITs, as NOT all REITs are guareanteed to be successful.It would be dangerous to invest in any REITs and stocks based solely on Dividend Yield comparisons, as there are other concerns like Gearing, DPU, Management, FOREX Risks in certain REITs, etc. Pertinent points to note...REITs offer investors the benefits of real estate investment along with the ease and advantages of investing in publicly traded stock.The investment characteristics of income-producing real estate has provided REIT investors with historically competitive long-term rates of return that complement the returns from other stocks and from bonds.REITs have historically provided investors dividend-based income, competitive market performance, transparency, liquidity, inflation protection and portfolio diversification.https://www.reit.com/investing/financial-benefits-reits0 comments1"

Some advatages of investing in REITs include:1) It allows you to own commercial real estate without facing the problems that most people owning real properties would have to face.You would not need to go through the trouble of finding people to rent your space, engaging in facilities management. All you will need to do is to collect your dividends.2) Returns are in the form of dividends An advantage of this would be that you will be able to get money on a regular basis and could possible be another form of income. you will also be able to decide whether you will want to reinvest the dividends paid. If they choose to do so, they will just need to purchase more shares. 3) Returns through appreciationREITs have been performing well historically due to the steady long-term apprecaition of commercial real estate. Any short term fluctuations in inlfation and interest rates are unlikely to affect REITs to a large extent.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Exposure to property as an asset class with low quantum. Relatively steady stream of income from rental as the fund has to pay 90% of all rental income out to investors.Potential high capital gains as underlying asset is constantly leveraged. Underlying assets are tangible.0 comments0"
