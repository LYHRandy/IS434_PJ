1,"Young ChengaiLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 07 Jul 2018He teaches you how to earn passive income from stocks. It won't make you rich overnight but you will start to see results after sticking to the methodologies after a few years. Compared to some courses which claims to make you rich fast, i feel that I-Min's class is more legit and down to earth. Furthermore, since he is able to teach in SGX, it shows he has a certain level of qualification as i don't think SGX will allow just anyone to teach under their brand name. Just attend his free preview if you have any doubts. Cheers!0 comments2"
