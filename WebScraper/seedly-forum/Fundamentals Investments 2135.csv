1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Mar 2019Hello!I am currently in uni as well so i understand how busy uni students are. However, it is still possible to learn investment despite your busy scehdule! Here are some tips on how I have been learning investment.When I am on the bus or waiting for the train, i like to read investment blogs such as seedly, finance.sg as they publish comprehensive articles on up to date news. Also, joining CCAs related to investment would also help to improve your knowledge in investment such as investment societies. Or you can also sign up for workshops offered in school that teaches you about invesments. I also think that reading investment books are also a good start to picking up investment! Hope this helps and all the best in oyur investment journey !0 comments2"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Mar 2019I'm also in NUS currently, and I know that as a student your life can be super busy and hectice. But I believe there are a few things you can do that can help you learn investing.Investopedia: Read through Investopedia's guides and watch their videos! They provide a basic rough guideline on how investing works, and the whole user experience is quite friendly. You don't have to spend hours on learning from here, but consistent spending of time over a good period of time is very helpful!""Investing for Dummies"": Again, another platform where you can learn about investing. Don't have to pour through the time, just spend some time reading consistently and over a period of time you would have a better grasp! You can probably find this book at the library, be it in school or in the public.Pick Up Passive Investing: Passive investing, as the name suggests, means that you don't have to spend too much time monitoring your investments too actively, which may work to your advantage. Passive investments can include blue chip stocks which pay out consistent dividends, REITs, bonds, ETFs or even the ""auto-invest"" function on P2P sites. Maybe you can just learn about one first, and then invest?Attend finance classes in school: For those already in business school, you can take mods relating to finance already, such as portfolio management, or personal wealth management. For those not from business schools, you can take them as unrestricted electives or modules! They can help you to ""clear"" mods while learning about investing also. 5. Join the Investment Club: There's a good chance that there are investment clubs in your school! Go join such a club and learn from the rest :) This may take up more time in your week, but the network and community you form is very important!0 comments1"
3,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Mar 2019I believe everyone in life today is busy with something. Therefore its about prioritising what you value the most, and how badly you want to achieve it!I think first off, unifying both Zann and Isaac's point, the learning point is about how to better utilize pockets of free time you have, to accumulate investing knowledge, be it basic finance or more specific practical trading info. I would imagine Its pretty difficult to be reading heavy investing books- unless your travel time is going to be 20minutes at least. I would personally recommend We Study Billionaires which can be found on spotify(_what I usually use), youtube, itunes._ Secondly, like all good habits- a good way for sustainability is by finding/forming a community/group that shares the same passion for investing as you. Although Investment Clubs might seem intimidating to many beginners and some amateurs even, I urge you all to apply and give the application your best shot! Even if you don't make it(just as I didn't), there were plenty of things I picked up independently along the process which I wouldnt have exposed myself to that early. Actually that early exposure has recently helped me on some of my current finance projects and stock pitch competition!Even though I didn't get in, eventually I found peers who shared the same interests as I did in US equity markets and we still often share and chat about recent news and market movers whenever we meet up!I hope sharing my personal experience and thoughts will help you in some way:)0 comments0"
