question,"Insurance General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 May 2019Why is euthanasia not allowed when I do not want to suffer or burden others?I guess most of us already have Insurance covered relatively well. But I was visiting my Grandma at the hospital the other day and she was bedridden and in so much pain, having very bad dementia such that she forgets everything that has happened over the past 15 mins. She also has slight depression and keeps saying ""dying is better""It makes me think, I don't want to live this life(future) myself and I would rather die, why is euthanasia not allowed when I do not want to suffer or burden others?4 answersAnswerBump0"

WizardAnswered on 16 May 2019This hits a topic close to my heart.End of life care is a topic that is important to be discussed with loved ones, but many avoid it as they feel that it is taboo, or 'pantang'. One of the things that I have realized is, while it may be true that your grandma might be forgetting things every 15 minutes, it doesn't affect her ability to feel your love and presence. I was at a talk listening to end-of-life practitioners working at KTPH, and sometimes a simple act of holding their hand could touch hearts more than the generic 'have you eaten yet?'.End-of-life care is not just about emotions, it also covers the practical aspects of what you or your loved ones want when they are near the end of their lives. Sometimes, having that discussions way before hand could help in avoiding some nasty situations that may occur from lack of planning.0 comments1"
2,"KdzLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 15 May 2019Dear Anon, thank you for sharing your thoughts and feelings. I am sorry that you have to go through this experience. It is okay to feel what you are feeling right now. I am glad that you’ve found a platform to share. Being bedridden and in an unfamiliar place for individuals with dementia can be very distressing, not only to your Grandma but also to her love ones.While we are working to find it’s cure and preventive solutions There are few ways that may provide comfort to your grandma. While pain reliefs are reasonable, they are temporary with potential side effects. Hence you can consider bringing things that she is familiar with eg. her generation music, radio, books, old pictures, pillows or scent. Based on my published research these may calm individuals with dementia.As for yourself and family, you may consider support groups where you can gain valuable insights and perspectives such as here https://alz.org.sg/csg/ . You can also consider respite care when you bring her home to give yourself a short break when needed.One way to probably keep your mind at ease for the future is to do an Advanced Care Planning or Advance Medical Directives. As of now they are free. These help to inform your wishes to the professionals and family when you do not have the capacity to do so. You may also be at ease knowing that your wishes are out there if anything were to happen. Therefore, apart from insurance I strongly encourage individuals to ink their ACP and AMD. More information here: https://www.healthxchange.sg/healthcare-financing/social-services/advance-medical-directive-advance-care-planning-future-health-crisesWith that I end with a short quote “Death ends a life but not a relationship.” Hope that everything will be smooth for you and your family, do take care of yourself..Disclaimer: This disclaimer informs readers that the views, thoughts and opinion expressed in the text belong solely to the author, and not necessarily to the author’s employer, organization, committee or other group or individual.

MasterAnswered on 15 May 2019Basically, Euthanasia can become a convenient excuse (a lot of why people jump from building just for the life coverage when financial crisis hit).Insurance is meant to cover financial needs, so you can pay a lot more attention to other needs, which may include, but not limited to, social needs, health needs, care and concern, being there for the person, time together etc etc.Hence Life is more than money, but without money, life is just about money :(0 comments0"
4,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 May 2019Insurance effectively is just a safeguard against unforeseen high costs which may not be affordable at that point in time. We're in an Asian society where values are much more conservative. How can we ensure patients are not pressured to doing so? Are they in the right state of mind to make the decision? (Depression) Why research for drugs for critical illness when they can simply euthanise? While we may mean well, there's also many unintended consequences we have to consider.0 comments0"
