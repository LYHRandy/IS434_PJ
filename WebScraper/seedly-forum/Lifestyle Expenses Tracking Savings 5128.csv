1,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018I'm also thinking of getting the Airpods and here are some things that I'm factoring in..â€‹CompatibilityMany people rave about the Airpods because of its compatibility with the Apple products (ease of connectivity, user experiences and etc). If you don't intend to use it with Apple products, then most likely you shouldn't consider this already..â€‹Sound QualityFrom what I have found, the sound quality seems to be the same as the default earphones provided when you purchase an iPhone. So will you be satisfied with the sound quality for the price in exchange of convenience (wireless and compatibility with Apple products)?â€‹PriceTo be honest, the Airpods are not cheap. In fact, you can get a better sound quality wireless earphones with that money. Again, is the price justifiable for the convenience?â€‹Hope that helps! Do let us know if you decided to buy or not buy the Airpods!0 comments3"

I went for a talk on wireless devices & now keep my phones off/on flight mode when I sleep. They say its safer to stick with wired. 0 comments2

5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019As a closet audiophile, I'll say no. You are paying a hefty price for wireless buds that sound like crap. And if you are on the train underground? Good luck trying to hear any details in your music without cranking up the volume. Which has the unfortunate effect of deafening your ear drums and disturbing the people around you. That's why I  usually only use custom in ears when I commute. â€‹Go for a decent pair of in-ears instead. Sound much better for cheaper or about the same price as an airpods. Try Jaben at Aldephi, or Zeppelin at Sim Lim Square for nice cosy places to try out earphones. Ask for Claire or Uncle Wilson at Jaben, or Kristy or Jian Bin at Zeppelin. You may be able to get some discount if you mention you were referred there by me, especially at Jaben. Both shops will have budget options and run all the way to the insanely priced ones. Leave your wallet outside the shops first before stepping in though; the poison is deep ;)2 comments0"

8,"Jay Liu, Sleepyhead at Land of Dreams Level 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018No. Its overpriced product. As an avid earphone person, I'll recommend you getting China products to try rather than conventional brands. You can try out Soundpeats, KZ series. I'm using soundpeats q30 now. 0 comments0"
9,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018Personally I feel that it is not worth it. Why not buy some other brands that is more worth the money?0 comments0
10,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018To be honest I think Airpods are one of the least comfortable earphones.â€‹There are many other brands which have better sound quality and better comfort as well. Brands like JBL, Shure, Jabra all have bluetooth earphones and wired ones.â€‹I'm currently using Klipsch Earphones. I'm using the wired model R6i, but there have bluetooth ones as well. I use them because the sound quality is really good, and the earbuds are really comfortable- as they come in 4 different sizes/types, and you can choose the one that suits you the most.â€‹Moreover, they also come with a 1-2 year 1-for-1 exchange local warranty, so in case something goes wrong, you can still get a new pair for free!0 comments0"
