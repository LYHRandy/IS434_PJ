I don't want to be irresponsible and give off any wrong ideas that what I've achieved should be a minimal expectation either. Salary increases are tied to one's skills and value to the company, and everyone has different capabilities so I don't think there's much value in me sharing mine cos I'm me and you're you :) My advice to fresh grads would be to focus on building up your skills and experience before you put your eye on your pay. When you upskill yourself and make yourself invaluable, you naturally will then be able to earn more. If your company doesn't wanna pay you an increase, look for someone else who will. When you're a real talent, job offers and opportunities should be plenty :)0 comments0"
