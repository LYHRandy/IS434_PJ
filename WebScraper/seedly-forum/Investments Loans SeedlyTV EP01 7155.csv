question,"Investments Loans SeedlyTV EP01 Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Mar 2019Should I begin investing as well or should I just focus on paying off my student loan?I have a student loan to clear off within the next year as I just graduated but earning a stable salary now of $3,000 gross. So I was thinking of allocating a larger chunk of my take home to paying down my debt vs some amount to start investing. Do you think that is a viable option or do you recommend clearing down my student debt first?1 answerAnswerBump0"
