4,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Aug 2019Grab is the way to go if you want to drive for income. Some go even further by renting a place in JB to stay then rent out their HDB in SG.So they can pump full petrol in JB before coming into SG to drive Grab. Earn in SGD but spending in Ringgit. Triples their spending power with currency conversion.0 comments0"
