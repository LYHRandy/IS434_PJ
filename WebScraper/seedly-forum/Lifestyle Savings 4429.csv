1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 14 Sep 2019I would tell my 21-year-old self to stop delaying and went ahead to read about investment stuff and put money in.I delayed for a few years even though I am interested in personal finance and investments since my teenage years. That time, I guess I was too cautious and coward. So I would tell my 21-year-old self to stop delaying, be brave and take that first step early.2 comments7"

It will rise in price 10 yrs later, then sell at $18000.Haha. jokes aside, I will tell him to do whatever he wants to do.If he has done all the investment advice and money advice, he probably has less fun, less friends, less memories of his 21-25 yrs. if he has done all the fun stuff, car stuff, party stuff, he probably has less money, less future now.so yeah.... just continue the balance. nothing is right or wrong. there is always a cost, just that you will not be aware till years later.PS: I will come back 5 yrs later to see if I will change this answer)0 comments5"

5,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 14 Sep 2019I always love the above graphic.Financial Advice: Even though I started investing early, I started with small amounts. Looking back, I wish I put in more money at the time. Otherwise, I don't think I would have done anything very different. Life in General: Relationships: I believe that there is no one person in the whole world who is the one-and-only person for you. Holding on to that notion might prevent you from being open and seeing what the world has to offer. Additionally, people change, and relationships change. Trust but verify: There is too much false information out there right now. Same goes for older people who come into your life who 'try to give advice'. Sometimes, they might not be the most well-meaning people. Start honing your judgement from a young age.Career: Try as many things when you are young so that you have that perspective of what you like, and what you really don't like. You don't want to be spending 10 years at a place hating it.Health: Am a big advocate of taking care of your health. Chronic illnesses that previously used to plague older people are now affecting people at a younger age, and this is really linked to our lifestyle choices.0 comments3"
6,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019I would tell my 21 years old to focus on financial market, and learn how to setup a business. Buy ETFs when there is recession and market is done 20% and more. Ladder the buys.
Get more mentors, learn from others, and do not be afraid to fall. Because the more you do, the more you learn, and the more important it is to learn from your mistakes.And not to procrastinate and blame others. Get yourself together in the act.0 comments3"

""it's ok to have fun, do volunteering work but also start your freelancing. You are gonna lose your father next year so cherish the time with him when he is around and it's ok to confront openly on your different perspective. Make sure you take graduation pictures with him ahead because he is not gonna make it till then.
You can keep your promise to him really well and do a lot of great things later 10 years, therefore, you are more than enough. You are stronger than you think so you can dream big, feel enough and enjoy the present moment. Make sure you exercise from here until your thirties rather than realize health is wealth later. You didn't get to invest early in properties or any investment but your decision to invest in humans (your sister and brother future) is the best investment. You don't need to be afraid to start a business early on because of childhood programming you will do just fine. All in all, your dad and mom are always proud of you so you can love yourself more and you deserve to buy a property early 30 not later. I wish you started travelling from your 20!!! you deserve it ""☺️0 comments0"
