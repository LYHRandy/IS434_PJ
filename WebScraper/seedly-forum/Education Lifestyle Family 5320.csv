question,"Education Lifestyle Family Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Dec 2018My son, at 13, has begun selling in-game items for very high prices (gaming accounts at more than $100, in-game items for $30+). Should I be encouraging this?I know that some of the people who buy from him are students using their parents money. On one hand, I a little proud of him being able to make money on his own. On the other hand, he spends more and more time on these games, and I don't really want to encourage young people to spend their parent's money on games7 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 17 Dec 2018I am one of the old guys whom was a kid and did similar stuff like what your son did (My era was Maplestory, Gunbound, Conquer Online, Dragonica, Pokemon gameboy trading, etc...).I don't earn money from gaming, I do show people how to complete or how to game with some strategy, (i.e. God of War, WOW, etc).To me it is a journey of growing up with games. I would sugggest you as a parent can monitor him from far. Do give gentle reminder or advises at times but don't be too controlling.I need to understand the right context of ""spends more and more time on these game"", how much is ""more"" ? Personally last time I do game average 4-5 hours daily during the 56k dial up era and on holidays I game 8- 10 hours, sometimes 10-15 hours too.I got no comments on ""I dont really want to encourage young people to spend their parent's money on games"". Because this is their choice, if they don't spend on your son's loot they will spend on else where. For example, you cant limit which shop sell liquor. If one shop doesn't sell, you go to the next. An anology.Just sharing my experience here, if your son isn't doing anything really ""bad"" or neglect his studies ""completely"", it is a journey.I paid a price for this journey by having an extra year in Secondary school, but thinking back I will still do the same thing in my own way again.0 comments2"
2,"Justin Kieran OngLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I am answer thing this from the viewpoint of a gamer.While he is monetizing his hobbies, do keep an eye on how long he spends doing it. Remind him that he has other priorities. Another point to note is what he is selling and how he gets the items. If he is earning the items with his own hard work then it's good and all but if he is buying the items and selling them for a higher price or putting it up for auction to the highest bidder it may be time to step in before it becomes something like the CS GO lotto. Also, Korea just legally criminalized game boosting where you pay someone else to level up your character. 4 comments1"

Good if you can teach him the perspective as well as how to handle the wealth.0 comments1"
5,"Adriel ThinLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 17 Dec 2018I think it's a perfect opportunity for him to learn entrepreneurship. Instead of discouraging him, perhaps help him understand the economics of it. If he thinks he is running a business, perhaps help him calculate how much he is earning per hour of gaming instead of the absolute value. If the amount of money he is making per hour is low, you could persuade him to reconsider spending so much time on the games as it could be giving very low returns. Alternatively, perhaps help him think of ways in which he can expand his 'business', such as through derivatives like making money from walkthroughs or streams (Robert Kiyosaki). Other lessons could include the cost of running a business, such as making him buy the hardware using his own money and paying for some portion of the electricity bill as part of ""overhead costs"". Some of these lessons could be very valuable and something not taught in schools.As for other children spending their parents' money, it is something that's out of yours and your son's control. Even if your son does not sell his products, those children will be spending the money elsewhere. Having said that, if your son is spending more and more time on games and neglecting other areas of his life such as studies and social life, then a good talk to grant him some perspective would be useful. Ultimately, I think this is a valuable opportunity for your son to learn some lessons about entrepreneurship, specifically about opportunity costs and return on investment of time.0 comments0"
6,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 17 Dec 2018Seedly people generally likes to encourage enterpreneurism, but i have the following concerns.Some concerns here.
1. Is it illegal or grey market?
2. Is he spending money on this pursuit? Or buying ingame currency or cryptocurrency with cash?
3. Is he likely to get scammed or preyed upon? (Money, or socially)
4. Is he spending too much time on mining and farming to create these accounts?If the answers to all of the above are no, then should be fine. But honestly idk anything about this market, so perhaps you should try and find someone who has experience.As to your customers' ethics, don't overthink it. It is not your responsibility to police their spending habits. Your concern can actually be applied to all products sold by merchants, whose ultimate aim is to get people to buy their products... consider toys and kids' games.0 comments0"
7,Npm AdeleLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 17 Dec 2018Kudos to his entrepreneurial spirit. Can get him to think about profits vs ethics. Maybe not so much for games but if he were CEO of a company manufacturing a life saving drug etc. Just spark a conversation and nurture that critical thinking?:)0 comments0
