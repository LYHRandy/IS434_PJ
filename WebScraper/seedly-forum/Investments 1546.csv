2,MMe20 Apr 2019Read online that Saxo is more suitable if trade at lower amountJonathan Chia Guangrong20 Apr 2019Honestly have not heard much about saxo. Other than from their previously seen ads it seem like they focus a lot on cfds. Not my cup of tea. I personally use Td where I get a $5 min comm if I trade stocks but I use it for options at $1 per contract. No custodian or live data feed fees.
