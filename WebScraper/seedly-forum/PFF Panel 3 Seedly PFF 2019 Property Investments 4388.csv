1,"Zuhdy FarhanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 02 Mar 2019The market was at its peak in 2018, until the government announced cooling measures which slowed down demand for buying properties.In 2019, experts are mixed with where the market is going - some expect prices to stabilise and continue rising steadily while others believe it will drop. Personally, it seems that prices are dropping, after analysing different properties and looking at URA's PPI.This has a positive effect on the rental market as more foreigners are less keen to buy properties because of ABSD and are looking to rent instead.The biggest thing in the market in 2019 are New Launches.So for yourself, if you would like to buy a new property, the biggest setback would be the ABSD (the stamp duty on the purchase price). Questions you should ask yourself:Are you a Singaporean, PR or Foreign Resident? How many properties do you currently own?If you are a Singaporean with no properties at hand, then you're in luck - no ABSD will be payable on your first property. However, you would have to pay 12% for your second property and 15% for your third and subsequent properties.If you are a PR, your first property is subjected to 5% ABSD, followed by 15% for subsequent ones.If you are a foreigner, it's 20% for all properties.ABSD aside, if you are keen to invest, it is important to know your financial needs and projects that have potentially higher capital appreciation - perhaps a new MRT that will be built nearby, or the price trends of the project.Location wise, look to growth areas and follow trends to see how properties in these areas will be affected.So in summary, it depends on what kind of investment you are looking at - passive income or capital appreciation and your financial situation. In this market in 2019, it is a challenge to find both.0 comments0"
