Often, people misintepret data especially those from abroad: Economic Intellegence Unit (EIU) report ranks Singapore as most expensive city. However, upon closer analysis of the components taken into account, it does not closely track our daily lifestyle. Mercer's cost of living survey is aimed at measuring expatraits' cost of living in different parts of the word. It is an usefel tool for human resource managers where they can decide where they can place their people,1) Currency:Expensive place for expatraits. Singapore dollar has strengthened over recent years. It is more expensive for a foreigner paid in a foreign currency or for a coporate HQ whose earnings are in foreign currency,2) Goods & services measured in the cost of living basket in the survey:Consists of imported cheese, Burberry raincoat, fillet mignion, 4 best seats in a theatre, 3 course dinner at a high end restaurant for 4 people. Highly different from what average Singaporean will consume.3) Transport:Part of cost of living basket but do not include public transport, only private cars, and taxis. Public tranport in Singapore is significantly cheaper than most other cities, London, New York, Tokyo and comparable to Hong Kong. Even taxi fare is cheaper. But cars in Singapore are expensive because the country is small. If it is an expatrait buying car in Singapore, it is expensive. But if we were talking about average Singaporeans taking public transport, it is many more times cheaper than most other cities.While that is not to say everything is cheap, there has been significant effort by the government to ensure daily necessities are affordable, from ensuring that there's $3 meals at hawker centres to providing GST vouchers for subsidies.There's no lack of jobs here but it depends whether you are selective about it. If you're aiming for 'top-tier' careers, you may face more difficulty with competition from other foreign talents and locals as well. There are jobs (e.g early childhood education) which has significantly less pay but still provide an income. Another point for consideration depends on how much you seek to upgrade yourself. Upgrading and improvement allow better career improvement and/or career transition.0 comments0"
