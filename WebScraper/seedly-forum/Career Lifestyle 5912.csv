question,"Career Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Nov 2018I work in as an accounting firm, but my passion is in writing. Is there any way to get started? Is it possible to write full-time in Singapore?I've been an accountant for 3 years. I pays relatively well, and I am good at what I do, but it feels like a dead job. I only learnt it because it was a safe option for me. I am passionate about writing, but have not really started on any big projects. What should I do?3 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 19 Nov 2018Would suggest that u set aside time each week for your passion.You can start out by identifying key topics that you would love to write about. Start small perhaps with your own personal blog or reach out to marketing agencies that do copywriting.Slowly gain a following and Launch your own book next time!All the best in your journey. Perhaps you should talk to Jeraldine. She is very passionate about writing too and is starting or have already started on her book!0 comments2"

With this you're not entirely committed to writing yet, while gaining exposure to market needs and honing skills.Elsa Goh23 Nov 2018Nice, thanks!"
