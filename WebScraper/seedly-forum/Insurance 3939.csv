1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Mar 2019Hi Alok, insurance products are honestly hard to understand and there are sometimes huge differences between direct purchase insurance products and those you purchase through an advisor or a firm.Insurance is also a matter of life and death and its supposed to give your comfort and peace after purchasing adequate coverage for yourself. For such a situation, I'd rather rely on a professional whose entire job is to understand and recommend solutions that provide you with a peace of mind. And lastly, there are tons products out there, and insurers try their best to differentiate their products from each other, thus, if you'd like a comparison and advice from someone who has access to multiple insurers, you may want to look for an Independent Financial Advisor representative like myself. :)0 comments0"

3,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019If it's your first insurance, almost certainly through an agent. An agent will talk to you about what insurances are necessary, priortize them from first to last and strike a fine balance between need and budget. We are accessible almost all the time via mobile, will also answer all necessary clarifications, and are obligated to do your claims for you in the event of any. Also, I'm an agent. You can talk to me. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
