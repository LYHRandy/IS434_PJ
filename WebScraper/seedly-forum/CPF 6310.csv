MasterAnswered on 22 Nov 2018For CPF MA top-up,If you are an employee, you can write in to your HR to credit more into your medisave (which also allows them additional 1% tax relief for the company), while you enjoy tax relief from the employment.If you are a self-employed, yes, you will enjoy reduced income tax (depending on your tax bracket). You must declare your self-employment to CPF too.CPF SA top up confirm counts towards tax-relief (ceveat, its only reserved for FRS, can't use it for BRS).0 comments0"
