1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 28 Nov 2018There is nothing wrong with MLM products. But if u do not like the product, You'll just have to tell her straight that u do not want to.For person who have closer relationship with : What I always do is that I will just buy 1 unit (if its not too ex) to 'try out'. Take it as helping her and also trying some supplements for yourself/parents, but after that u can just say u dont feel any difference so u'll not buy again.I dont mind spend a little to help others, as i do not know when I'll need their help too. Also have an open mind to try things that really might be good. If the product I feel really doesnt benefit me, I will just feedback nicely that it is not suited for me.0 comments0"
