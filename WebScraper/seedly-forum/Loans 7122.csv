MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019远水救不了近火.The most direct solution is to get loans from parents and relatives.You might not be able to get the full amount from one group but you can portion out the loan amount to make it acceptable by them to loan you.Getting the loan from people who trust and willing to help you, YOU MUST FOCUS ON SETTLING THE DEDT FULLY and not prolong or increase the mistake.Make resolution from this bad experiences and learn not to trust people too easily and cherish the people who help you this round.1 comment7"

Grand MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019A) sell old stuff in carousell- every little bit helps.B) faster grabfood or foodpanda, don't use scooter or bicycle, just walk first, earn as much as possible dailyC) small amount do the minimum repayment to the bank. If u can do at least minimum repayment, you can talk easier to them to extend the loan period or reduce interest rates.Borrow from other banks only if1) the new loan has a lower interest rate. If you have existing credit card, go for 6 months balance transfer promotion. The rate is usually 2-3% for 6months for balance transfer. Go google for ""balance transfer"". This offer will not extend to you if any banks has registered you as ""bad debt"" in credit bureau.2) you have an existing job, so the 6 months loan promo helps you to extend the deadline for another 6months while you work and save.3) extra job to earn more and repay faster4) Do NOT ever skip any repayment amount. Pay the minimum AT LEAST(more if possible). This is very important to signal to the bank you are not a bad debtor. If you have bad debt, it is going to take huge effort to restore your credit assessment, and woes on you later for property or car loan5) If you need to borrow from relatives, borrow with every intention to return. If you do not return, the lost amount is nothing compared to your reputation loss... forever.Draw out a reasonable plan, show them you can repay them $X amount per month, for how many months, and perhaps offer a slight interest that is lower than what you are paying now.Calculate and prepare all these before approaching relatives or friends, this will at least show that you are prepared.And most importantly, obey your debt obligations.You need your friends and relatives to come off in 6months or 12 months thinking ""ok this guy not bad, i helped him and i did not regret helping him"".Its okay to borrow money, but if you do not repay them, the trust lost willdestroy relationship, ESPECIALLY among relatives.EDIT I will like to add, the debt is manageable- $30k can be repaid off in 2 years.Most people can't because they have pride. Put down your pride, put all your awake time to work for jobs. IF you are talented, go for upwork.com or fiverr.com and work Part times.If not, go for GrabFood or Foodpanda or etc.Hardwork can pay off $30k. Sweat a bit.0 comments6"
4,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 14 Jun 2019I am no expert here but let me try my best.Credit card interest rate is insane and killer. I think you can apply for a personal loan, at a much lower interest rate. Then immediately use the personal loan cash to pay off all credit cards.If you have other loans at high interest rates, use the personal loan to clear them all off first.Then focus all your effort to clear the personal loan. Don't take anymore risk in investing. There is no easy way out anymore and its just facing the reality here. Make some sacrifice, cut down expenses where you can.3 comments4"
5,See all 3 comments Charmaine Ng14 Jun 2019Please do not think of getting more loans to tide over. It doesn't help you really. What you are getting is more loans and more interest rates. Please contact CCS (per my above suggestion) and get advice from the guys who have helped many with their debts (with no incentives...!)Charmaine Ng14 Jun 2019Sorry I meant I posted a comment below; with links and experiences in CCS. Do not take on more debt though! All the best

7,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 08 Jun 2019How much difference is it away from 12x of your salary?Unpopular opinion: If it's not too near away, take up a little more to reach the 12x so you quality for DCP (which is usually at 6-8% p.a. with 1-2% processing fee - much better than any other loan out there).An easier to stomach option would be trying to get a balance transfer to reduce the highest interest loans first. You then give yourself some breathing time to work things out.If you have a private property, you can reverse mortgage it to get cash (secured loan) and pay off these high interest debts. Current interest rate on secured loan should not be higher than 2.3%.If you live in a large HDB (4/5 room), it may be worthwhile to downsize to a less-prime location to unlock cash. Of course, please do your calculations right. You don't want do all that to only have your money lock up in CPF.By calculations, if you maxed out your credit cards and loans, it should reasonably be around 12x since credit card limits are usually 4x monthly income (per bank). Or if your gross income is actually pretty high, speak to a bank about restructuring your loans. They will usually allow you to do that (approx 10% p.a. with 3% processing fee). From there, you can slowly pay off in bulk when you have more cash.Sources to get more cash: Drive Grab during your free time (~$15/hr). If you focus only on peak timing, you can make around $30/hr. Do part-time jobs such as events ($10-15/hr). Deliver Grabfood - lower entry criteria. You can even do it on foot/bicycle - approx $8/hr.0 comments2"
8,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 09 Jun 2019Starting off. Do let your love ones know about your situation, if not letting them know is worsening your debt due to you having to keep face.Even if you don’t want to borrow from them. At least let them know so they won’t expect certain things from you. If you are married, it is even more important you share the same goal.Second to get extra income, as some of the others mention, can be grab driver, etc. If you got property can rent it out (one room or stay with parents and rent whole unit out). Sell off assets like car if you are not going to be grab driver. (Convenience should be the last of your concern). Sell off other investments, except insurance.Lastly, manage your lifestyle, I added this as there are really many people who have no self awareness to their spending. Eg. If you sell your car you really shouldn’t be taking a cab anymore. Stop all restaurant visits including fast food. Budget everything and keep to it strictly. Like each meal should not exceed $5 if you eat out, etc. Clearly identify needs and wants. Basically life will be hard but the more difficult it is, the faster you can clear your debt. If you take the attitude that it’s just a few dollars, and relax every other day, you will take longer to clear your debt.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 08 Jun 2019Clear the high interest loans quickly first and at least make the minimum monthly repayments to avoid additional penalties.seek help from your friends/family to help to clear away the high interest debts for you first. Save more from your current income, cut expenses, look to sell some of your excess luxury items to tide you over this short period..0 comments1"

11,"Chris Chin, Senior Supply Chain at MncLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do sympathise with your situation. However, I'm sorry that I have to caution all to beware of such requests for loans and stay away from scammers who will take our kindness for weakness. Nobody should help such strangers, unless we are satisfied with your proof of how you arrived at such a predicament and how you will guarantee the loan. Few years ago, my friend  had a bad experience helping a new colleague and didn't get back the money as promised. 
That colleague showed photos of his days as a GRC member and told many stories about how he helped many people. Suddenly, one weekend he sent a photo of his in-law involved in an accident overseas and needed a quick loan. 
He reassured my friend that the in-laws are provision shop owners and can repay the following week. However, he kept delaying payment when my friend contacted him after 1 week and finally  blocked my friend's number. The loan is still outstanding but he is still uncontactable.0 comments1"
12,"ZPZheLiang PangLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Try to avoid taking more debt first.Gather all the information from your current loan, e.g. loan amount, tenure, interest rate, minimum repaymentGather all your available assets that can be liquidated to reduce the debtsExhaust all resources to pay off the debt with the highest interestDebt consolidation may charge you a fee which may not be worth it after all. If employed, consider speaking to employer for advance salary with agreed terms.Most importantly is to create a debt repayment strategy that works. This needs time, therefore need to remain strong emotionally.0 comments1"
13,"Shaun GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Just curious, let's say an individual (or group of individuals) were willing to lend the money to clear off the loan immediately to avoid further interest (at let's say half the interest rate & a longer repayment term), is there any way to 'safeguard' the lenders other than holding collateral or out of 'trust'.0 comments1"
14,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 14 Jun 2019Hey friend, consider register for CCS info talk here: https://www.ccs.org.sg/about-ccs/page/appointmentsCCS has this plan calls DMP (Debt Management Plan) which could be your savior.. I had a friend in similar situation to yours (hers was due to business sold off but continued to live on high credits + lifestyle choices which led to the ultimate inability to pay off debts that rolled over). She wasn't eligible for DCP either. We went to the talk together; she ended up asking CCS to help her and she is on her way to financial freedom soon.What CCS did for her was that they helped scrutinized her lifestyle choices + expenses and gave good advices on how to keep herself in check. Of course it takes time for her to change her habits.. but she is getting better everytime I see her and I'm positively influenced by some of the habits too! That said, CCS helped negotiated lower interest rates for her debts as well and set a loan tenure for her (based on ability to pay off after minusing expenses.. if you do not have a job or do not have enough excess to pay the banks CCS may reject to help you; but once they decided to help 90% it will go through).I am happy you're seeking help and here's a link. https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/credit-cards-line-credit-facilities-243/debt-management-programme-dmp-credit-counselling-singapore-ccs-5821687-53.html This is the very thread that got me talking to my friend.. who then went with me to the info talk and got help~ Thing is though, you won't be able to get a credit facility at least until you've repaid your debts (why would you want to anyway?)
I believe you must have most of the ways that the others have suggest; budgeting.. cutting expenses etc. but interest rates is a much better maranthon runner vs budgeting. So I suggest you register for the talk asap and seek help from CCS immediately; at the end of the day you can always think over if you'd like them to submit a proposal for you after the one-on-one counselling session.0 comments0"
