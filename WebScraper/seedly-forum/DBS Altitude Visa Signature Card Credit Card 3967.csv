question,"DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Aug 2019Should a fresh grad get the DBS Altitude Amex or Visa?For context, I've spent around S$2000 on online flights this month and I should be able to hit the $6000 min spend within the first 3 months. I would've gone for the Altitude Visa without much thought because of the Priority Pass, but there's an extra sign up promo for Amex now (offers 50% more miles on first 3 months spend) that is making me think twice. Btw I'm a fresh grad and this would be my first credit card. Which should I apply for?3 answersAnswerBump0"

RookieAnswered on 22 Sep 20191) Feel free to sign up for both - you can - unless you have a philosophical objection towards too many cards.2) Please re-read the TNCs regarding bonus miles on flights, and while you're at it, on the AMEX promotion too. This helps you to know your rights.3) Note that it's generally harder to spend using an AMEX in Singapore. And if this is going to be your general spending card, you need to consider that.0 comments0"

To answer your question, the Amex promo is subjected to an extension after Sep 30, and to note that merchant acceptance for Amex is not as wide as Visa. Unless you are making (very) big purchases the 50% more miles promo is subjected to first 10,000 miles earned on your Amex card. Happy travelling!0 comments0"
