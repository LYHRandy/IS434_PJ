MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Hi, to add on to the comments, beginner friendly websites such as Dr wealth and the Motley Fool also provide very easy to digest information regarding financial instruments and current market situations, which are an excellent way to buff up your knowledge regarding the financial markets and the important factors that affect their pricing, stability, investor confidence etc. Personally, I include a website filtering service called Feedly(no affliation to Seedly) that basically allows me to choose the particular websites that I want to receive news from, and filter only business news, or certain keywords so I can get a quick fix of information when I wake up in the morning, and the headlines are organized into categories such as ""business"" ""global general news"" or ""politics"" to get me up to speed within 5 or 10 minutes. Very useful, and very convenient for a hectic schedule!0 comments1"

Terms such as: Dividends, Sharpe Ratio, Mutual Funds, Options, Derivatives etc are very well explained and there are also videos to aid those who are visual learners.For me, I like to browse Stocktwits, which is a forum where people talk about that particular stock that you are interested in. (Disregarding all the ""noise"" on that platform) It is a good platform because users frequently post links to news relevant to that stock, hence it saves you alot of time in finding it yourself and it also keeps you updated.Another website (which isn't strictly about investment per se) that I would recommend is Bloomberg, and they have really comprehensive news articles that give insights to macroeconomic trends as well as financial news to keep you up to speed with global affairs.0 comments1"
