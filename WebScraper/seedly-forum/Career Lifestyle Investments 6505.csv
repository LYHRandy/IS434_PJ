1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Personally, my favourite is on being a realist!To me, this would mean seeing reality as it is, and not how I want it to be, which also includes how I see myself as well. I try to see myself along with all my strengths and weaknesses, and to take on challenges that are suited for myself, and to push me out of my comfort zone. I also try to see reality as objectively as possible, so I avoid the problem of underthinking or overthinking, and to see what I can get out of reality the most!0 comments0"
