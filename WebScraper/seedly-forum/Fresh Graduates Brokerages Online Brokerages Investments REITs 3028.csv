question,"Fresh Graduates Brokerages Online Brokerages Investments REITs Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Nov 2018Should I invest in REITS using Maybank KE RSP or open a brokerage account? Looking to invest only a small sum of $100 per month.?Hi! I read several articles and forums and I'm still confused at my best possible choice. I'm a fresh grad and if I'm only looking at making a small investment into REITS, would investing via RSP each month incur too much commission fees? Or should I stay out of the market, until I have perhaps a larger sum of $1000-$5000, then open a brokerage account?3 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 18 Nov 2018I'm personally using Maybank KE as well to buy into a reit every month to build my income floor and it's a great way to get exposure to your desired reit every month. This is especially when you have a low amount to invest on a monthly basis. Maybank ke also has a wide range of other counters if you want to change into something else along the way 0 comments0"

If you're planning to invest only $100 monthly, you can go with RSP. Comission fees are roughly the same ~0.2% unless you're investing more than 100k.Theoretically, the stock market follows an upward drift, meaning that you should invest at the earliet possible opportunity. That is true if the market is bearish. However since markets rise more often than they fall, you will be incurring opportunity cost and lump sum investing is a better bet. RSP/ETFs are better if you do not have time to manage but still yield positive returns, and may prevents you from selling low.0 comments0"
