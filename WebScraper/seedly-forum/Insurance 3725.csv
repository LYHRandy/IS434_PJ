1,"Joyce Chan, Senior Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 02 Aug 2019While it's ultimately a personal preference, there seems to be a trend. For new cars, people tend to get comprehensive cover so that damages to their own cars are covered. However, for older cars (e.g. cars that have renewed COE), some choose to go with 3rd party only as they can stomach the risks of scraping an older car due to an accident better than that of a newer car. Hope this quick answer helps!0 comments0"
