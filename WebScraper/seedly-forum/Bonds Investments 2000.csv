1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Hi there Cs! We have answered this at a similar question here: https://seedly.sg/questions/will-you-buy-the-3-03-per-annum-with-singapore-airlines-s-retail-bond-2019Here is a summary:I will personally pass as well after reading the analysis.. I would rather take a safer bet at 2-3% with SSBs.SIA will be releasing $500 mil worth of bonds, with the public being allocated $300 mil out of this and the rest going to institutional investors. Should the bond be oversubscribed, they will expand it up to $750 mil.What you need to do is to access the ability for SIA to pay the interest on their debts.The yield is hardly exciting and perhaps a reflection of the credit worthiness of the issuer. This yield is slightly higher than last year’s hot Temasek 5 year 2.70% bond. For reference, the yield on the 10 year SGS bond is 2.10% and the 5 year SGS bond is around 1.99%.The net debt to asset also showed that in the past 10 years, SIA have been in net cash position (cash more than debt). However, this has been deteriorating. SIA is now in net debt position. However, the level of debt is still very very low. Their financial position looks strong enough to pay the coupon payment.0 comments1"
