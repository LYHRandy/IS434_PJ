1,"Lim Zhi CongLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019As an NSF myself, I started out with index funds first. That's because index funds tracks is a basket of shares, means you are basically diversifying into multiple counters at once.
Forr a 19 year old, I think its best to gain knowledge while handling the practical part of investment. Starting off at 19 is a huge advantage that many people wish to have. Take advantage of your youth and make mistakes and learn from them and you will grow to become a seasoned investor in no time.1 comment2"

MasterAnswered on 16 Mar 2019Buying some shares in the STI ETF, or getting some shares of the Vanguard ETF to track S&P 500. since they track the broad market index you are more or less completely diversified so you skipped a few steps there - but do note that STI is quite skewed towards the financial industry because their major contributors are the banks like DBS ,UOB , OCBC etc. so in terms of diversification it can be argued that S&P is better.But, STI gives good dividend yield, so if you like good dividend payouts perhaps STI ETF is a good option. But if you want to see your capital grow, investing in the US vanguard S&P 500 ETF is better because their capital gain potential is relatively larger. https://ycharts.com/indicators/sandp_500_total_return_annual this website shows the yoy growth of total returns of the S&P. But you will be exposed to Foreign exchange risk because the money is in USD, so if you see that the currency will appreciate against SGD, it is a good idea to put money into Vanguard etf instead.Either way, both options are pretty good, gives you modest returns, and you don't really need to check back constantly.0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jun 2019It really depends on how much time you have and what is your risk appetite.I'm currently 19 and I just started investing in May, when most stocks were at their 52w highs (fml), but i held on and slowly averaged down on most of them, and now I'm on the green on everything! Since you're still young just like me, I'd say learn to stock pick, it really isn't that hard, there are many videos and articles you can read and watch to learn what criterias to look for in a company etc. There are also many different types of investment strategies, so you should go search it up and see which suits you more ! For me, I'm using the dividend growth strategy but with a mix of Value Investing!An advice I'd give for a beginner just starting out, don't worry when your investments drop 5% or even 10%, if you did your research, the company will eventually pull through and bring you profits ! I was down almost 5% on my 2nd week of investing but I held on strong and now I'm riding the green !!Good luck on your investing journey !!0 comments0"
7,"Good SamaritanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 23 Mar 2019Analyze your own risk portfolio in investment first!!You have to ask yourself if you are a risk taker or not. If your investment had bad returns, what will you do? Are you able to sleep at noght comfortably if you lose a lot of money? Investment is all about risk. If you are not risk taker, its better to stick to those safer financial instruments! Or just get endowment plan0 comments0"
