You are not going to generate substantial income at the start unless you are lucky to inherit a million dollars or win toto first prize.We start small, re-invest the dividends, inject fresh capital and over time your portfolio grows and your dividends gets bigger.In a world of instant gratification, this can be a tough thing to do. But the rewards are sweet.0 comments0"
