1,"Jonathan Ng, Economics at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Jun 2019I have an OCBC Frank account but I do not park my savings there as the interest is rather minimal! I choose to put them in CIMB Fastsaver that gives me 1% without any conditions attached.I did not look at OCBC 360 or DBS Multiplier as I'm unable to fulfill the criterias for higher interest rates.0 comments4"

MasterUpdated on 10 Jun 2019OCBC 360 for The win !Aside to that I think you should also look at the other accounts out there using the Seedly calculator to judge if there might be a better one based on your lifestyle2 comments2"

4,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Jun 2019Personally I have a Frank and a 360 account.My salary and all of my giro deductions go against the 360 account (my treasury account).I transfer my monthly allowance to Frank account (my spending account)For 10k balance, if you meet the salary crediting criteria, 360 would be kinda worth it....But honestly, if you do not see an urgent need for the money, I think you are slightly better off putting like 5k in SSB to get 2% yield on non-urgent monies you are keeping as a reserve.0 comments1"

It can be quite difficult if your lifestyle does not meet the account requirements. I hope you don't change your spending/investments just to earn that 0.5% interest. Do see your regular usage pattern and see if the account suits. You can always switch to other banks if there are no products in OCBC that suits you.0 comments1
6,"Vincent Tan Wen BinLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 11 Jun 2019I would go with 360 if you are able to fulfill the criterias for their interest. The interest return is pretty good, as with multiplier dbs and uob one account. But just start somewhere and start looking for more investments to add into your portfolio to create passive income stream.2 comments1"
