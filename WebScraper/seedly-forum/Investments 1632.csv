1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Overwriting my comment, here's a more in-depth analysis of the fund flow reports where one can obtain it from SGX on a weekly basis -- https://www2.sgx.com/research-education/fund-flow-reportsAs these reports encompasses an entire week of trading, the figures of a stock could be highly swayed by activity on a particular day (i.e Genting results, hence its on institutions Top 10 Net Sell). Hence there can be a particular surge of buy/sell volume on a particular day leading to the counter being one of the top 10 on the list. But overall, analysing a weekly fund flow by plotting out the percentage difference of closing price of Monday 1st April and Friday 5th April, this is what I managed to uncover. And this is precisely the reason why Retail investors can never beat Institutions. Then again, there are a couple of unknowns such as the initial entry price where retailers might want to take profit and this is based on the analysis of one week. So if you're able to mimic the minds of institutions and if the stock you purchase for that week ends up on the Top 10 Net Buys of Institutions, you'd have a higher possibility of profiting from the stock market.3 comments5"

3,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Apr 2019Hey there, There’s a good reason why. Berkshire Hathaway’s purchases may be publicly announced, but it is in a quarterly basis. By then, the information may be too little too late. Even if it is a share that Mr Warren Buffett is willing to hold, you may not buy at the same, or better price then he does. Furthermore, if he realises he made a mistake, he can sell immediately, but you would only know 1 quarter later. At best, you knew he sold, but not why he sold, and where he used the proceeds at. Another consideration is that one may not be as emotionally stable as he is. This is a guy who’s been through the Great Depression and knew what it‘s like been in the worst economic condition possible. Not many people today have been through similar circumstances.0 comments3"
4,"Boon Tee EngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 14 Apr 2019Actually investors could copy Berkshire Hathaway returns (to a certain extend), as the positions are disclosed in the 13F. However there are few reasons investors were not capable to do so:1) BRK positions are boring, and the long-term buy & hold make it even more boring. Many retail investors prefer to hold stocks that are exciting2) Even if investors try to copy his holding for certain period of time, there will be period of underperformance that will prompt him to ditch this strategy and go for something else3) Not all BRK positions are public equities, there are stocks that were privitised entirely and hence not able to be acquired4) Time lag, as the 13F disclosure is only made quarterly. However this is of minor issue compared to the (1) & (2) above because BRK has low turnover0 comments2"

6,"Jansen Ng, Business Student at NtuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Considering the answers provided above,  would it then be safe to say if the prices fall below their avg prices bought by Berkshire, we are on safe grounds to purchase?1 comment0"
7,"Jansen Ng13 Apr 2019Of course, buy timing is one thing, sell timing is another. By the time Berkshire sells the stocks, and published, insituational investors will also tend to sell and driving price down drastically, leaving us with the mess"
