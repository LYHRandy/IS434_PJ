WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Instead of another qualifications, unless you are sure that qualifications can get you jobs and pays ok or the same as current. May qualifications may not work that well during downturns. ​If you can, pick up a side line, a skill or transform your hobbies now into a side income while the time is good now and when the time is bad, it serve as a back up or possibly one day becomes your own main :) ​On the other hand, also network to people in the same and different but related field, as the people you know if you provide good service to them, they might be a good recommedations to you one day for a better job or in bad times. ​I believe in bad times, skills wins over cert! In all times, connections and the friends you know wins you over skills and cert! ​Cheers! ​2 comments1"

Those are just ""hobby learning"" status.​Compared to really quality certs like CCNA, PMP, CFA type of status, those WSQ ones are really no use.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 20181) If it's related to the industry that you are or planning to work in, can consider going for it since it might make you stand out from your peers/competitors​2) If you can pay for the course using SkillsFuture credits and if you have free time, why not0 comments0"
