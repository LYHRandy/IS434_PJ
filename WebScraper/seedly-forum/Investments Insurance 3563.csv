1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Because the distribution costs referred to in par products or ILPs are in reference to the fund management fee charges (trailer fees etc) and not like, literally distribution such as advertising or the like. All financial products regulated in this manner can and must only declare their costs in this manner. 0 comments0"
