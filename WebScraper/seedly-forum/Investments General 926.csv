1,"SWShaun Wq LimLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Apr 2019The price decline started during the time of the acquisition of Wing Hang Bank by OCBC. Since then, the price has lagged behind the other two banks. One current reason why OCBC is not as attractive as the other two now could be the dividends. OCBC has taken a more conservative stance towards increasing their dividend payout.0 comments1"

Though OCBC does have a smaller market cap than DBS, it doesn't mean much against if we just compare the price and market cap of these organisations alone, I think what we should be focusing on should be the relative valuation ratios such as P/E ratios PEG ratios etc. that would give a relative performance or overpriced/underpriced gauge of these firms.0 comments0"
