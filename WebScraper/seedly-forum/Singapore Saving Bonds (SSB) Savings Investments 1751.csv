Though it's not very significant but you can cut down on 5 extra transaction which is an extra if $20. If you have larger sums then it might be a different situation. Also, i personally wont recommend you to wait as you'll never know when is the 'best' rates. If it goes up the next month you may continue waiting because you think that the following month will be better and it will take months before you start. If you start early you start getting that 1.8% interest earlier as well.0 comments0"
