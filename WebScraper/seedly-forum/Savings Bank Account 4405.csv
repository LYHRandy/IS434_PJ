5,Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered 3w agoI personally prefer DBS as it is rather easy to hit the high tier interest based on my spending habit. Plus a lot of things can be done online which makes banking very convenient.I find OCBC a bit troublesome with slightly more hassle. Never really try UOB one though. Not planning to as I feel that reconciliation will be a headache.0 comments0
6,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 03 Sep 2018DBS Multiplier, I like the fact that there is no minimum spending requirement for the credit card and can easily hit 1.85% interest just by fulfilling only 2 criteria.0 comments0"
7,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 03 Sep 2018DBS Multiplier since I can combo with another promotion DBS BYOB (promo ended last year). I like that there's no minimum spend with credit card, hence it's easier to achieve 2 transaction type. 0 comments0"
8,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Sep 2018Skip OCBC. Their IT and Stand chart has been pretty worrying these days.​If only within these 3 then yes DBSM as UOB One is good at 3.88% now but there are criterias like minimum $500 spending per mth, salary crediting etc. If it's not an hassle for you and easily achievable then go for it.​For OCBC 360 personally I think it's a little tedious and hassle to hit all the different criterias.​0 comments0"
