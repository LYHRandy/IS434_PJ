1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 May 2019Consider maybank ke. It has the widest range of stocks you can buy into on a monthly basis. Offers not just stocks here but also those in Thailand, Malaysia and US. Minimum of 100 a month to start and fees are 1%. Been using it for a couple of years and it's a great platform.As with any investment, doing your own due diligence is needed.0 comments1"

So far its quite stable with a returns of about 3% dividend.Another viable option is OCBC Blue chip investment program. You can look into stable blue chip investments such as Banks, Telco, REITS/Properties such as capitaland. All these are quite stable.However for OCBC BCIP the downside is the charges which is min $5. So its only advisable if your monthly contribution is significant enough to cover the charges.0 comments1"
