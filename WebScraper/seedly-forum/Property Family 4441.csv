Financial situation is also something that will be looked at. If the property in question is bigger-room and you are financially well, it will be much harder. One of the case (I heard) that is successful: reasons among her parents' flat is very small and have family issues, property in question is a 3room flat. She is also divorced, childless, and close to age35. The other option is if u are able to form a family nucleas with your parent? But I think most parents have their name to their property. Have u considered to delay your divorce? You might want to consider a formal agreement of separation. Discuss with your lawyer. Reach an agreement with your husband now, u could start paying for the hdb mortgage in full first. Let me know if u require more help or lawyer referral (if u not already have one).0 comments0"
