1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Big Avengers fan here!Tony Stark / Iron ManHe probably represents tech stocks. He keeps innovating and coming up with new suits, just like the big tech companies like Google and Amazon. But he is also reckless, like how in his bid to build a stronger technological defense, he ended up creating Ultron, the villian of the 2nd Avengers film. This kind of reminded me of Facebook, in how it had played a role, no matter big or small, in the New Zealand shooting and the spread of domestic terrorism.Captain AmericaCaptain America is conservative and stable. I believe he represents more mature companies like General Electric, who have been around for ages. His moral compass is unwavering, and he being so many years old (because he was born in the 1920s and got frozen in ice), kind of represents the longevity and stability of large but old conglomerates.Black PantherBlack panther sounds like Emerging Market investments! For one, they originate from developing and emerging nations (Wakanda is still situated in Africa), but may have a lot of growth potential as well. As Wakanda is likely to open up to the world in future movies, I believe this also symbolises the opening up of emerging markets to the rest of the world. In a more meta way, Black Panther will likely replace the original avengers (Iron Man, Thor etc) in future movies, just like how emerging markets are starting to have more significance in how the global markets are being affected. The Black Panther film also outperformed box office expectations, just like how some emerging market companies might have great potential to outperform expectations as an undervalued stock.ThanosThis is the big baddie of the Avengers film that snapped away (spoilers alert) half of all life in the previous Avengers. He could represent an economic recession, like the one in 2008, which wiped out much of many firm's market value. But as the victory of Thanos rallied together the remaining Avengers to say ""Whatever it Takes"", so too I believe, do recessions rally us together to find out what went wrong with the economy.The directors of the latest Avengers film, Joe and Anthony Russo, have mentioned that we will be surprised by how the story unfolds in End Game and how we can't predict it. I guess that can be an allegory of the global economy as well!1 comment13"

5,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Hawkeye Hawkeye represent the retail investors that knows what they are doing. He does not possess any superhuman ability or have any super high tech gadget to fight (other than his special arrows). He have trained hard to master his archery skills just like how we need to learn about investments to be good at it. He is able to keep himselves calm and collected to make sure his arrows hit their targets while in the midst of every intense fight. As investors, we have to stay calm when the market is going crazy no matter if its bull or bear market so that we would not make mistakes.(The moment where he stayed calm and hit Loki)0 comments4"

He's a self-made superhero which I think many of us here aspire to become some day.I would say he's like a Blue Chip stock, highest in the pile.0 comments4"
