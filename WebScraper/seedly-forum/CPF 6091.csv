1,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 30 Aug 2019OA to SA transfer is irreversible. A better option might be to utilize your CPF Funds for investment under the CPF Investment Scheme(CPFIS). This has a twofold advantage:Firstly, you will be potentially able to earn a higher interest rate than that of CPF SA's 4%.
Secondly, you can only invest CPF OA monies beyond the first 20k of your OA funds. In this manner, you have a security net that touch wood, in case anything negatively impacts your income and subsequently affect your abilities to make mortgage payments, this 20k can tide you over easily. In the worst-case scenario, the 20k runs out and you can resort to liquidating said investments.0 comments3"
