God of WisdomAnswered on 16 Jul 2019You can invest in a Regular Savings Plan through fund platforms or banks, or a Global Portfolio via Financial Advisors either digitally through Robos (like Stashaway) or traditionally via Independent FAs like myself. :)I recommend investing with a strategy in mind, and with an understanding of asset allocation that will adapt throughout your investment journey, do remember to rebalance your holdings as well to maintain your risk exposure.0 comments2"
