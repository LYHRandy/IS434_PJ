1,"Charmaine Lim XiaomeiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 26 Nov 2018That's a very general statement!I find that the industry, company and role have a much higher impact on fresh graduates' starting pay as compared to their choice of education. For e.g.an investment banking intern / full-timer at Goldman Sachs earns approx S$8000/mtha facilities management intern / full timer at Land Transport Authority (LTA) earns S$800/mth and $3500/mth respectivelyAlso, most companies have a standard salary package based on your role and experience. Therefore, the starting pay should be the same for the same company and role, irregardless of the graduating university.For that reason, I think that salary guides that are classified by degree / qualifications are more accurate of fresh graduates' starting salaries.0 comments1"

WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I think you'd have to take these articles with a pinch of salt.Consider how many working hours these hawkers put inFixed Costs/Variable CostsRealistically, do the patrons find the food good? Are there long queues?IMHO, more of often than not, these articles tend to omit certain facts like that (after tax salary etc.)But still, a good starting point for interesting discussions!2 comments0"
