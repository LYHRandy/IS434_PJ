1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Feb 2019Some investors can benefit from a bear market by shorting stocks. This involves borrowing shares, selling them, and then buying them back at a lower price as their prices drop over time. The profit you would make is the difference at which selling price and purchasing price. This strategy works on the assumption that share prices will continue to drop. But if share prices increase, you will have to buy it back at a premium. So this can be risky for some people. Put options can also be bought and exercised, with the expectations that prices will continue to fall. Inverse ETFs can also be considered. Inverse ETFs change values in the opposite direction of the indexes that they are based on. 0 comments1"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Feb 2019A downturn allows us to potential buy undervalued stocks - investors who lose confidence in their stocks may make rash, emotional decisions that result in them exiting the market from their stocks, which causes the price of these stocks to fall below the fair market value (or the value which should be the actual price of the stock, according to efficient market hypothesis). Hence, this allows you to snap up multiple ""value-for-money"" stocks, which would eventually bounce back allow you to repa substantial capital gains. As for how to evaluate such stocks, I suggest reading up on Discounted Cash Flow valuation which can be found within Investopedia. Of course, the model may be much more complex than the theoretical one, but this should be a good starting point for you to begin your own valuation journey. If not, comparisons of different valuation ratios between different companies is also a feasible option - for example choosing a company with a P/E ratio below the industry average in a downturn can be a viable way to picking winning stocks!0 comments1"
3,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Feb 2019How I like to do things is research on companies you think are potential strong buys in the long run- but might currently be trading at a overvalued price in your opinion. As Richard mentioned, DCF can be a good way of getting an estimate of what the stock should be trading at(note this is an estimate at best). Subsequently, macro factors like an economic downturn or a steep selloff would present good opportunities for investors to buy into their current list of stocks they have been monitoring.0 comments0"
