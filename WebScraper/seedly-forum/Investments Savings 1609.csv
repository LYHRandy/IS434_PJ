MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 20193 years is really a short time to leave the money untouched.Instead of what you should invest in for these 3 years, the more important question would be what is the purpose of this money. Are you using the money for wedding, renovation, holiday, or for retirement eventually? If the objective of this money is for something that is definitely happening in 3 years time, perhaps you would like to invest into instruments that are liquid and less volatile. An Example would be SSBs or a high interest bank account, or Fixed income funds.  In fact, STI or SGX stocks would not be a good suggestion at all because no one can predict the price points 3 years down the road, and unlike what was mentioned, STI or SGX is relatively volatile compared to the instruments which I suggested above. What if a market crash were to happen when you need the money?However, if your purpose is for retirement, perhaps you should start reading up some Seedly Articles on Investments and ETFs and get yourself started by setting up a brokerage account. You may consider S&P500 and QQQ or IWDA ETFs. Once you start having a deeper understanding about equities and fixed income and REITS, you may consider building your own portfolio of individual holdings of stock, bonds or REIT.0 comments1"

Have you done a financial assessment? 
Are these funds meant for something important after 3 years? 
What sort of risk are you willing to take or prepared to lose this amount?If this amount is not in any high interest savings account, you might want to open one and shift the amount there as a first step.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 15 Apr 2019Hello!If you are looking at investing something that has relatively low risks, investing in the Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB) would be a good idea as it is backed by the government and is one of the safer investments around.Another way would be to invest in ETFs such as through Regular Savings Plan offered by banks such as DBS. By opting for this savings plan, you will essentially be investing in STI ETFs. Besides using regular savings plan to invest in ETFs, roboadvisors would be another way that you can invest your money in. Investing in ETFs through either roboadvisors or Regular Savings Plan usually have higher risks as compared to investing in the SSB.It is important to read about the invesments first before deciding to invest in it! The seedly blog has many useful articles about investments that you can check out to help you out with your invesment journey :)hope this helps and all the best in your invesment journey!0 comments0"
