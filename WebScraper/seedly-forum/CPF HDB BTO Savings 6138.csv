1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Jun 2019It's a question that I am facing myself as well - but I am single and have no kids on the way (Congrats on no. 2 coming btw! And also savings of $150k at age 35!)There are several data points you would need to evaluate. If you took up a bank loan, do check to see how interest rates have changed (they have gone up) if you took it at a floating rate, and also see if there are any penalties whatsoever for early repayment. I was also considering refinancing my mortgage, but post doing the calculations (which included other admin fees), it made more sense for me to wait.If your wife is looking to stay at home, and you are essentially the sole breadwinner to a household of 4 (not including your parents on both sides), it is important for you to evaluate your cashflows. Paying up fully with cash now might not make the most sense, UNLESS you have enough buffer.0 comments1"

I also worry about the loans, and I have been thinking many months about the issue as I worry about retrenchment. I could share some of my thoughts and plans.1) I revamped my cash investments to be mostly good paying and steady reits that pay 5+% cash dividends (but I bought most during downturn last yr). I have been counting on these reits to be a cashflow generator with the plan of having those dividends to help pay some of the loans.2) for oa, I have also been doing some investments. There are two ways to go about here, using the oa as a reserve to pay the loan (backup plan), and decent investments where over time, the dividends may grow to help pay the loan too, and when that happens, you could switch the loan to be paid from oa.In my humble opinion, maybe you can explore using the cpf oa as buffer, and evaluate if your investments and dividends can take up the role as 2nd income to hopefully pay the loan on your wife's behalf. Takes good investing though.If your monthly household expense is 4k, and clearly your income is above that, then I would
A) first focus on checking you have enough cash / cpf oa to cover for 12 mths paymentsB) slowly evaluate and change ongoing investments to those that pay decent cash dividends to offset the expenses / loanC) among the tips I shared on savings hacks, the two with best payoff is reviewing tv / internet / handphone expenses to shave off those you dont need, then check your insurance and see if changing from monthly to annual payments could save you a few hundred / thousand per year? These savings would greatly help. If your savings are 100+k, then managing the cashflow timing shouldnt be an issue.Focus on slowly increasing the loan buffer till at least 6 mths, then slowly increasing cash dividend / interest income to offset your cashflow. If you do it well, this would make your cashflow better to manage / reduce the impact of the loss of one income.When the kids go to primary school, maybe your wife would be ok to go back to work so that could be another alternative. That would reduce your stress to maybe about 7 yrs or less?Dont pay down the loan immediately, but focusing on increasing the buffer and improving cashflow until you start having excess cash that you can do partial payment every two or three years. Its about ensuring survival for the long term. No cash on hand could be worse for you when the unexpected happens.0 comments0"

Wife staying home isn't a bad idea, you can go home to healthier home cooked meals! HahaBased on your current situation, check if the emergency funds is sufficient or too much. Also get in place disability income plan on yourself before the family turns into a single income family, where all responsibilities on making money fall onto you. This is to set your foundation for protecting your home and family. You may also need to lower your investment budget when your wife stops working, and diversify investments into lower risks ones since there's going to be less room for error.It looks like you have the capacity to repay HDB loan up front immediately. You can consider doing so if your investment returns are less than 2.6%p.a. Otherwise, just take your time to repay over 25 years, no hurry to do so.If you took up bank loan, then it's different story. Check if there's any penalties on early repayment, and also if there's signs that bank is raising their interest rates before making the decision.So this helps!0 comments0"

RookieAnswered on 22 Jun 2019In my humble opinion, use CPF first, but do note the CPF withdrawal limit for your property, if itâ€™s a new property, usually shouldnâ€™t be an issue. You can use that cash to invest in dividend paying funds that pays 5-8%p.a to cover the loss of interest due to the loan. A little complex and too little info to work with here. I suggest you find an advisor to run through the cash flow for you0 comments0"
