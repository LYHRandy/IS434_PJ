1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Try to get an approval in-principle for the home loan first. If both of you can get it, then you will know whats the max you can loan from the bank. After that you will know if the max loan can allow you to purchase a 4room BTO. You both would probably qualify for quite alot of grants too.So, check out the approval in principle, work out the finances together, check with the HDB website how much grants you can get.2 comments0"

May I know whether we can get an approval in principle to check the flat we can buy even though we are getting an HDB loan at the end of the day?Gabriel Tham06 May 2019For HDB, you can apply to get the Home Loan Eligibility Letter from HDB. It will inform you how much loan you can get from HDB
