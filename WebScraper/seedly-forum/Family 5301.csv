GeniusAnswered on 27 Sep 20181) The marriage license paperwork takes lots of time especially if the other is from Western country with social welfare which typically has more stringent regulation for an Asian spouse. Needs lots of paperwork, original birth certificate, education cert, employment letter, apostille, interview etc. Be prepared may take 6 months to get clearance for the marriage permit to allow marriage. 2) You can apply for Long-Term Visa but likely only get 1 year approved, which will be further renewed such as 1+ 1+ 3 years. Even application of Long Term Visa for your spouse will be dependent on your own salary. If your salary is low, quite tough to get approval as government will think you cannot afford to support your foreigner spouse. ICA won't state this in writing but it is true. You can apply for SPR for your spouse but chances are will be rejected unless already living in SG for at least 3 years and contributing. 3) Whilst your spouse is on Long Term Visa, be prepared that the hospital bills, polyclinic bills etc will be on 'private' without subsidy, so I suggest getting the best A-ward restructured or private hospital insurance to cover. You can buy Shield insurance plan for your spouse but will be tied to your name, but charges are based on private rates non subsidy.4) You are not allowed to buy a 3 room and bigger BTO, unless your spouse is SPR. However, you can buy resale flat and put your foreigner spouse name as a legal occupier if you are below 35. If you are above 35, of course no problem to buy as a single for resale or single for 2-room BTO only.5) Another issue is your spouse on Long Term Visa may have issues with opening bank account and mobile phone line. Reason is unable to prove residential address in Singapore. The only way is if you have a room rental contract that indicated that the person is living in that residential unit. Alternatively, to use your name on those stuff. Because bank wants prove of address either from utilities bill, rental contract, home ownership letter or insurance letter. 0 comments2"
