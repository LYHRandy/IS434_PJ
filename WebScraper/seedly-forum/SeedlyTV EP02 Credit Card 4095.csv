1,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Jun 2019Consider evaluating your current lifestyle and behaviors. Are you the type who consistently check in on available mile points and actively exchange them for rewards?The milepoints program you are considering; in exchange for the rewards, is it more worth in terms of $ value vs x% direct cash backs? (Comparison of different programs)What do you usually spend on? Travel? Daily expenses? From this line of thought you can check out available credit cards in market and explore their different types of miles/cashbacks programs.Lastly, always help yourself by taking up a program that is most applicable to your lifestyle. Say if you're not the type to travel frequently, does it makes sense to have a krisflyer mile card unless your corporate is ""SQ-Preferred""? Also avoid any programs that are too inflexible.Hope this helps!0 comments2"
