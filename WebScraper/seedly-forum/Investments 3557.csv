1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Jun 2018This means that your order was partial filled.​You wanted 5000 but the broker was only able to match you with a seller for 400. So, you managed to only buy 400.​This means that you still have to pay the FULL commission on that 400. This also means that the stock you want to buy is very low in liquidity.​A suggestion for low liquidity stock and to save on commission is to buy from the ""ASK"" queue rather than wait for the ""BID"". The spread between the ask and bid would likely be quite big but at least you dont run the risk that you waste commissions.0 comments0"
