I’ve $10k+ worth of loan left for uni - at 4.5% per annum.I would like to pursue another degree in computer science where I would have to loan around $20k at 4.5% per annum.

1,"Axib XnyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 10h agoHow about doing a part time higher degree to spread our the costs across the years while not losing the years of working experience? Experience matters in our local context. So part time pursuit will ensure you don't lose out. Another consideration is that being away from school for too long is going to make adjustments harder when you return to the structured learning.  Then, you can also service the loans at the same time. Do explore grants,  subsidies and scholarships too. Don't leave money on the table.  Never try,  never know.1 comment2"

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered 2w agoGiven that you sound pretty young - I would say to get a few more years of work experience first. It could be the case that you might not want to pursue computer science post your work experience, or want it even more.
Re: the argument of 'possibly getting a higher pay' - I do believe that relevant work experience counts more than another degree. From a cash flow perspective, it also makes sense to pay off your uni loans first, instead of being loaded with another loan, making your total loans $30k + at 4.5% p.a.0 comments2"
4,"Leslie Koh, Associate Financial Services Manager at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 3d agoPursue later, stabilise your cash flow and clear off your first loan first. My advice is don’t jump into getting another degree just because you’re currently in the industry. Things will change. Why not instead of paying the degree in your own, speak to your HR or some of the seniors in the company? There might be programs or bond that you can apply that the company will pay for your degree while you work for them. Having said that, I would still suggest you work for at least 1 year first to figure out what you want to do.0 comments1"
5,"Sharon LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 4d agoOf course the earlier the better BUT please pay off your loan first, the only number that stuck to my head after reading your post was 4.5% and it's your loan interest.
You can always consider Masters, Degree when you have cleared your loan.Meanwhile, pick up other languages by yourself and certifications too since they are cheaper.0 comments0"
6,"Nivi PraLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 6d agoHey Anon!Perhaps you should explore your motivations for wanting to pursue a CS degree.Are you hoping to transition into a programming career with this degree? Or do you want to pursue a CS degree because you are interested in the science and math involved in it?If it is the former, then it might help to know two things:CS as a discipline is very theoretical in nature, and differs quite significantly from programming, which is of a more practical nature. People who pursue CS degrees and then go into programming often comment that the latter is a very different ball game, and that their CS knowledge is often not directly applicable (although it provides a good theoretical foundation).A CS degree is not the only route to becoming a programmer. There are several options for industry switchers nowadays, such as bootcamps (e.g. General Assembly) that help career switchers like yourself transition to tech.
There are also government initiatives aimed at supporting Singaporeans in their switch to tech through hefty subsidies as well as career placement. An example is the Tech Immersion and Placement Programme by IMDA - may be worth checking out!Ultimately, if your final goal is to go into programming, then there are other cost-effective, and directly relevant/applicable ways to go about it compared to a uni degree. Hope this helps!0 comments0"

Grand MasterAnswered 2w agoLater.After working in society for a few years, you would have a better understanding of what your interest in life is, and what you want to pursue in life. You may also have a better understanding of what academic certification is utterly useless or overpriced and what is useful.The more mature you are in society, the better you would understand what is needed in life :)0 comments0"
