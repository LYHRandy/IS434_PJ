Some sectors that benefit from interest rate hikes are consumer discretionary stocks,  in other words manufacturers and sellers of consumer staples (food, beverages & hygiene goods) and healthcare stocks. Healthcare stocks will continue to perform as consumers still need to go to the doctor and buy medicine in spite of the market doing well or bad.0 comments0"
