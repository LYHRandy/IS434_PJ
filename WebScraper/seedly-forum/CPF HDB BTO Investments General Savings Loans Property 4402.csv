1,"Gerard Ong, Tax consultant  at Ernst & Young Level 4. ProdigyAnswered on 06 Sep 2018Yes of course, because it is akin to ""borrowing"" a loan from your own cpf account. The 200k would have generated interest had it remain in your cpf; so since it is being taken account the interest will need to come from you.Having said that, do take note that accrued interest will only be applicable if you sell that BTO subsequently. If you don't sell, no need to return accrued interest. 0 comments3"
2,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 06 Sep 2018Yes. The interest is accrued as though you never use the CPF for housing, you would be earning interest on that 200k. In other words, you still need to pay interest on the 200k. ​The interest you would have saved is the interest levied on loan, ie either HDB loan or bank loan. ​0 comments1"
