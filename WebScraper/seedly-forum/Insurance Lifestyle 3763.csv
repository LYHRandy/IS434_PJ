question,Insurance Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Jun 2019How does travel insurance claims for travel cancellation works? My partner have an important meeting and could not make it for our trip during September later this year. Only flights have been booked.?I understand that this cancellation is due to personal reasons but would like to seek advice on any ways to get the flight tickets expenditure back. My friend suggested getting a memo from doctor to indicate I'm unfit to travel but this may be a little risky as the it's not easy to get the memo. Thank you!! :)1 answerAnswerBumped2

Most of the cancellation clause only covers hospitalisation or extraordinary events such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks  and exclude perisonal reasons. I highly doubt that a doctor memo would suffice. What you can do is to try to sell your air tickets away on Carousell.0 comments0
