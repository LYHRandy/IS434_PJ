1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Apr 2019Based on your question, I'd assume you are talking about buying options instead of selling. Premiums for different strike prices will be different depending on the current distance from current stock price as well as the expiry date. Option premium is mainly made up of intrinsic value and time value. I won't go into technicals on how to calculate this as I don't use them myself but suffice to say, the higher the strike price is the cheaper the premium will be. Closer to the expiry date, premiums will also decay rapidly if the strike is out of the money. You need to be 100% right on the direction of the stock, else you won't really profit. So back to your question. Do you expect the stock to rise above $15 by the time your contract expires? If yes then buy that strike and wait for the stock to rise. Do note that 80% or more of options expire worthless, so it will be a better idea to learn how to sell options instead of buying them outright. Hope this helps.0 comments0"
