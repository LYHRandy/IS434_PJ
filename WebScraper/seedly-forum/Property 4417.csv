MasterAnswered on 04 Jan 2019You might want to read heartland boy explanation. https://heartlandboy.com/money-withdraw-from-your-cpf-at-55/Too long, do not wish to read, If you can do CPF Voluntary contribution as a self-employed, you still enjoy tax relief and also, you have a choice to include the amount for BRS (basic retirement sum) in the event you do not have enough money for FRS (full retirement sum). Any SA money done for RSTU (top up SA for tax relief) is ""reserved for RA account"" when you hit 55 for FRS. So it depends on whether you will be able to hit FRS.If you use OA to pay for housing, the only issue is you have 
1) accrued interest (which can be waived off at age 55, if you have enough for FRS) 
2) Your OA money is not earning 2.5% interest (but since you did top up, you are earning additional 1.5% interest, not sure. If you think this is a bad thing). 0 comments1"
