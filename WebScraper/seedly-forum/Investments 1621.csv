question,Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Apr 2019What to do with first $100k for beginner?Graduating from uni next mth and managed to save up my first $100k (in CIMB bank 1% interest). I have $5k in SSB and $2k in Temasek Bond for bout half a year now. Thinking of trying out some blue chip stocks and reits next with small amounts. I've been reading up on them but still feel abit lost looking at the real charts and numbers. Is it a bad idea for me to jump into stocks now? Should I stick with ETF while I learn more about stocks (though it feels like just reading won't get me anywhere)?2 answersAnswerBump1

1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 13 Apr 2019One important skill to have in portfolio management is asset allocation. 
Doesn’t matter if it is 10k, 100k or 1 million.They should be properly allocated according to the desired outcome you want to achieve. What is the desired outcome you want to achieve, capital gains, dividends, growth, etc?
Depending on your desired outcome, your portfolio strategy will be different; and of course you must accept the relevant risk that comes with every portfolio.What kind of assets do you want to own too, all these plays a part. Knowing this will help you to allocate your asset properly into the relevant asset classes and create a portfolio that works for you(right now you are mainly into equities and bonds/cash)I will encourage you to invest in something you understand, what you don’t, outsource them (you can always set a small portion of net worth for outsourcing) P.S. Seedly is a great community to ask what you don’t understand about stocks too, ask away, someone (maybe myself) might be able to help. :)0 comments5"
2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Apr 2019If you have the money to spare, you might want to consider going for investment courses. The learning curve for beginners is extremely steep, and lots of time is needed to learn the basics of investing. Thus, going for a course can fast-track your learning. Going for a course can also be considered an 'investment'. However, do your research on the courses before attending them. You may wish to head over to the ""Reviews"" section in Seedly to take a look at some :)Of course, there are other ways to go about doing it. You can read investment blogs to learn some basics! There are quite a few Singaporean financial bloggers. A simple google search will lead you to some. Seedly also has many useful blog posts to get you started!0 comments0"
