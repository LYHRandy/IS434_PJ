1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Oct 2018There are term plans that cover Eci and Ci alone, where you can opt for a Multipay term or just an ECI term. There wont be a need to call your agent. Look for dread disease or the word critical on your policy document. If its not there, you have neither. https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/prioritise-early-critical-illness-insurance-life-insurance0 comments0"

You should look at the Multi Pay CI plans as they are quite comprehensive and cover all stages of CI and even relapse of specific conditions.
