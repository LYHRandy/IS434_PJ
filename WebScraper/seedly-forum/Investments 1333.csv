WizardAnswered on 14 May 2019I was going to point you here but looks like they have no reviews yet...FSM MAPS reviews: https://seedly.sg/reviews/robo-advisors/fsm-one-fsm-mapsI personally use the FSM platform, so far it's been really good and easy to use! But that's purely for the online brokerage portion.0 comments0"

It gives you access to a globally diversified portfolio of UTs at a cost of 0.5% per annum. If you like active management and want a deeper exposure to markets outside of the US using said active management, then FSM Maps could be for you.With that being said, the average expense ratio on the UTs would be between 1-1.7%, and your overall cost may be higher than a basket of ETFs and a higher management fee from a different robo advisor.0 comments0"
