2,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Mine took about 2 weeks. Yeah sometimes there is a delay and you’ll just need to call in After you first transfer your starting funds to the account.​especially when you apply online! But after that once you get your iBanking user and pin, everything should be fine thereafter! Easy to access4 comments0"
