If you have gotten past this stage, then do note that those companies who implement Dimensional funds, they do not fashion themselves as a pure investment company.
They usually see themselves as a financial advisory firm.
Endowus leans more closer to a pure access one. Their current fees is 0.60%. This is not too far off from your other robo.
The rest, such as Providend, MoneyOwl see themselves more like an advisory. This means you are not just paying for the investments but an advisor that comes with it. Is that useful. It depends. I think it is useful for a lot of people. those that are hard core DIY would see less benefits.For those of you who wish to know not just about Dimensional funds, but the systems to build wealth using index and evidenced based funds can check out my blog post here:

GeniusAnswered on 06 Jun 2019Dear Anonymous,Yes as Hariz mentioned below, you can only buy Dimensional funds via financial advisors or brokers that have been approved by Dimensional. We are one of the financial advisors in Singapore that can offer access to Dimensional. You can take a look at our website here for more information. We currently use Dimensional's World Equity Fund for our equity allocation, which is a globally diversified fund with exposure to both developed and emerging markets. The fund uses a core strategy that has general exposure to the overall stock market with a greater allocation to shares of smaller sized companies, value companies, and profitable companies.Â We charge an Access Fee on top of the fund manager fee (fund expense ratio), for investment advice, portfolio creation and rebalancing, brokerage, and transfers.
AccessÂ FeeÂ per annum based on assets under advice (AUA):0.60%Â  Â S$200,000 and below0.50%Â  Â S$200,001 to S$1,000,0000.35%Â  Â S$1,000,001 to S$5,000,0000.25%Â  Â S$5,000,001 and aboveThe expense ratio for Dimensional's World Equity Fund is 0.43% p.a.0 comments2"

God of WisdomAnswered on 05 Feb 2019Yes, you'll require an FA or a broker that has access such as myself. Fees between the FA and clients are negotiable and usually lower if done on instruction only without advice required. 0 comments1"
