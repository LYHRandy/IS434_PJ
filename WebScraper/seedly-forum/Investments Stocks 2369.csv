question,"Investments Stocks Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Mar 2019Anyone following Warren Buffet and buying into GE now? I think its funny how Buffet made huge losses with GE in the past- having to apologize to shareholders before and liquidating its stake in 2017 despite repeated calls before, but is yet buying in now. Honestly given the discount GE is trading at now compared to its past, am tempted to buy in too...2 answersAnswerBump0"

WizardAnswered on 08 Mar 2019I think I also mentioned in another question.When these guys buy or sell, and the retailers get news of it, it is already very delayed. Especially when Buffett buys/sells, it will be in the SEC filing every quarter. Months have already passed when he bought the stock.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019DON'T FOLLOW BLINDLY!Just because Berkshire Hathaway(BRK) and Warren Buffett has had a very successful investing track record, doesn't mean he does not make mistakes!  Buffett made a poor bet on GE in the past- holding despite BRK investors repeated calls for mgt to justify holding GE. Recently, they have been in the spotlight over Kraft Heinz. Personally, I wouldnt be surprised if Buffett has some form of anchoring bias given his large position in GE previously. Just wrote my thoughts and opinion about GE's recent news in another post here.0 comments0"
