1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Hmm I don't predict property cycles so maybe you should speak to a property agent about this instead.However, the question I would pose to you is, if you were to cash out and downgrade now, what are you going to do with that cash?0 comments0"
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Do your research and see if your property will continue grow or not. If yes, you can hold longer. If no, cash out and downgrade. Its ur own house and investment, you have to make ur own decision.0 comments0"
