MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019Savings account can consider CIMB Fastsaver open with 1k but no fall below fees and 1% interest if your bank balance is 1k and above. But it is still good to have a DBS/OCBC/UOB acc because its easier to find their atm. OCBC Frank only charge fall below fee when u are 26 i think so you can just hold it for daily use. We can explain investment terms but i still strongly recommend to do your own research with google.Stocks are just simply the shares of a ownership in a company.Blue chips are stocks that are big and well known companies like DBS, OCBC and UOB in local context. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft in US context. Bonds are fixed income investment issued by government/corporate to borrow money and will give you fixed interest and the principal amount will be given back to you at the end date.Unit trust is a form of collective investment constituted under a trust deed. A unit trust pools investors' money into a single fund, which is managed by a fund manager. They invest in all sorts of things depends on which unit trust you join.The money you want to invest is quite small. You can consider Singapore Savings Bonds minimum $500 they can withdraw anytime you want but they may take 1 month to get the money back but they are definitely low risk and backed by government. Based on your situation that you write, i would recommend you to not invest anything right now though because you look like you dont know the basic stuffs. Take your time to learn more about personal finance and investments first before actually diving into it. Once you have good knowledge about it, you can even start a demo account to play around. Dont invest because people tell you this is good but invest because you did your own research which proves that it is a good investment and it is suitable for your goals, risk appetite and so on.0 comments1"
