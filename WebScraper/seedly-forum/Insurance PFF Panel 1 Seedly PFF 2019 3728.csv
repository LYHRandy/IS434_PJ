MasterAnswered on 01 Aug 2019In my humble opinion, you will have to weight the risk between the 5% co-payment scheme, and the premiums that is payable based on your age.On one hand, you can say that the insurance is affordable at a younger age, and gets increasingly more expensive that you might want to self-insure the riders.On the other hand, the risk of you going into hospital increases as you age, so it is fair for the premiums to scale up as you grow older.Of course, for personal risk, it totally depends on whether you can afford the deductibles and co-insurance should it happens. So you have to do your own risk assessment on this.0 comments0"
