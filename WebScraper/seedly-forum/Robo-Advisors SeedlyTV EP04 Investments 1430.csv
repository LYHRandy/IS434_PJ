question,"Robo-Advisors SeedlyTV EP04 Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 May 2019How do I determine my risk level for Robo Advisors?Hi guys, I'm currently a NSF earning about $1k allowance. I understand that since I am young and have fewer liabilities, my risk appetite should be higher. If this is the case, does that mean I should go for the highest risk in the case of Robo Advisors? (Looking at StashAway's 30% risk level).4 answersAnswerBump1"

MasterAnswered on 04 May 2019Dear AnonymousTo fully understand your risk level, you have to determine 3 factorsYour need to take riskThis is determined by your need for returns. If your need for returns is higher, then your need to take risk is higher. Your need for returns is obtained when you do your financial planning to know the returns you need to achieve certain objective.Your ability to take riskThis is determined by many factors - age, health, insurance status, time horizon, investment amount etc. Willingnees to take riskIn the financial services industry, this is determined though a set of questionnaires. These 3 factors interact with each other to help you determine your risk level. As an example, if your:a. Need to take risk Is lowb. Ability to take risk is lowc. Willingness to take risk is highYou should really not take risk.But if your:a. Need to take risk is highb. Ability to take risk Is highc. Willingness is lowThen you might need to be coached to take higher risk because you need to and you can. If you really do not want to, you have to accept a lower return, which means that you might not reach your goals. You might have to accept a lower goal or wait longer to achieve your goal. Coaching can come in many forms but one way is helping you understand what investments is really about. With knowledge, you have more confidence and might be more willing to take risk.This is why at MoneyOwl, we believe in bionic and not roboadvisory. While we build a high tech platform for you to ascertain your willingness to bear risk, there are times where you might want to speak to our advisers to better ascertain your risk level.Hope this helps.0 comments3"

WizardUpdated on 02 May 2019Hi When you sign up for the Robo advisor, they will determine your risk level base on your age, target achievement (objectives of how much you wanna get and by when) etc and recommend (you can adjust later in the settings). Usually as you're young , you have more time and thus you can pick higher risk level for higher returns so that 10 years later for marriage and housing, when you need the $ it will comes in handy. You can contribute regularly for the target monthly automatically by your bank GIRO to achieve the target. Do note that short term (1-3 years) you will see drastic up and downs. So hold still and keep on investing for at least 5- 10 years and the positive returns due to time in the market (longer terms where economy grows for the instruments invested in grows), you'll see positive grows. Do take note of the fees involved too.

Do what you are comfortable with and not what people tell you. The comment is just a sweeping statement made for reference. It will not take into account your personal situation. Just ask your self this question. Are you ok to risk losing all your money persuing the possibility of higher gains? If yes then you can go for the highest risk.Personally, i find using 1 risk level to measure all your investments really unwise, I split my risk levels into different portions. I.e. a certain % for high risk high gains (lose 50-100% also won‚Äôt blink) this % for mid range.... (stable companies with dividends) then another % for bonds. I suppose this is what diversification is about. Just find it really uncomfortable that Advisors are just using a blanket risk level for your whole portfolio. A better description I feel would be ‚Äúwhat is your risk level for this portion of your portfolio.‚Äù0 comments0"
