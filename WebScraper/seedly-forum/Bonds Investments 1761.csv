1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Apr 2019Well, If you're talking about the yields themselves, the tencent bonds are attractive, being marketed with indicative interest rates of 115, 140, 165 and 185 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries for the five-year, seven-year, 10-year and 30-year tranches, respectively. (taken from CNA website https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/chinese-tech-giant-tencent-plans-us-5-billion-bond-sale-sources-11404618 ). currently the 5, 7 10 and 30 year treasury bonds are yielding 2.31, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.91 respectively (taken from US treasury department website, https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield ), so you're looking at yields such as this:Tencent term structure for new bond issuance:5 years: 3.467 years: 3.810 years: 4.1530 years, 4.76Moodys have also given an A1 rating to tencent's credit rating, and given that China has relaxed the game authorization scrutiny, Tencent will be seeking far higher profit margins for the next few quarters as compared to the abysmal last quarter. Suffice to say, it is a rather attractive bond, one I may choose to pick up as well.0 comments0"
