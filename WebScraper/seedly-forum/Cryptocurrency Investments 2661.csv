1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 24 Feb 2019Personally I wouldnt look to cryptocurrency as a investment vehicle for stable annual returns, but I believe crypto is still viable as a investment vehicle.It is important however investors should not be buying into random new ICOs and expecting to capitalize on hot capital inflows during the crypto boom in early 2018. The market is now saturated and no longer as volatile. If you're investing in the crypto market, make sure to keep up to date on the latest blockchain techs and other related Macro news. I believe JP Morgan has recently announced coming up with their own crypto named JP coin. Bloomberg has a specific section for crypto news too. And like any crypto talk you attend- always read the White Paper of any ICO you intend to invest into.0 comments1"
