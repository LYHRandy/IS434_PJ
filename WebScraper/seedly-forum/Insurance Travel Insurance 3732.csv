question,Insurance Travel Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Jul 2019Will I get banned if I claim from the same travel insurer too often?I've been getting my travel insurance from the same insurer for a while now and am concerned whether I will get banned from making too many claims with them. Is there such a thing? Has anyone encountered such a ban before or can share any experience with me when it comes to over-claiming your travel insurance?1 answerAnswerBump0

God of WisdomAnswered on 30 Jul 2019There's no reason to be banned since if the claim is a valid one, it has to be paid. So far I've only made a travel insurance claim once (flight delay) and it was paid out without any issues.0 comments5"
