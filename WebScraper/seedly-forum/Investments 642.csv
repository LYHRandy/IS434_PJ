question,Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Aug 2019Looking for some recommendations on no-risk savings to low-risk investments for 40k fresh funds?I currently have a total of around 30k in SSB and an endowment plan ending next year. I have another 40k fresh fund and looking into no-risk savings to low-risk investments. I'm willing to diversify this sum into different areas and I had already set aside emergency funds. Would love some recommendations and opinions. Will Robo-advisor be suitable?1 answerAnswerBump0

God of WisdomUpdated on 27 Aug 2019Hi, if you are investing in equities, ETF, and UTs, I would not classify that as low risk. Once you are exposed to the market, you will be subjected to the movements of the market.One way to look at it, is to achieve low risk across your entire portfolio. This would mean that you need to deploy over various asset classes, ranging from zero risk to mid-high risk. Your asset allocation is the key to achieving the overall risk profile you are looking at. Bear in mind that your objectives for investing this money will also play a part in deciding your allocation and time horizon.A sampling of investments you can consider are1) Short term endowments: There are some endowments that offer around 2.3% p.a. guaranteed over 3 years, which is better than SSB or FD2) Start an annuity for withdrawal at a later age if you have the time horizon3) Low risk bond fund for preservation4) Balanced UTs for growth5) Defensive equities for moderate growthAlso, look at adding on to your investments regularly to build them over time.It would be best to sit down with an independent advisor like myself to look at all options before executing, as a proper strategy and foundation is important to ensure that your concerns are addressed and your risks are minimized.2 comments6"
