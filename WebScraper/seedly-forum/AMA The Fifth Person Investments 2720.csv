If the reason is no longer valid, cutting loss is the better option. Second, It seem like these two companies are cyclical in nature hence timing the cycle is an important factor here. If you expect the cycle to turn soon then sticking with it may be a better choice, if not you are better off cutting loss and investing in better companies that are predictable in nature to make back your losses. You don't have to make back your money the way you lose it. Remember to always compound your winner not your loser.0 comments0"

Did you buy them because they have strong fundamentals and look solid or do you buy them just because someone told u they are good and you buy them to follow the hype? You have to make your own decision in such situation. Do your research on them to see if they are still looking good and have plans to do better. If your research tells you, they are not looking too good then you have to make your own decision.0 comments0"
