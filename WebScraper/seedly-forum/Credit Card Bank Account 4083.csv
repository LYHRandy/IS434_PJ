question,"Credit Card Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 05 Jul 2019Is DBS the only bank where you can pay your credit card bills in-app? Its the most convenient method of paying, I’m just wondering if its the same for the other banks or do I still have to use AXS to pay them off. Thank you!3 answersAnswerBump0"
