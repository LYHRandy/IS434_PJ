question,"Credit Card CITI Rewards Card DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card Miles Transport Asked by AnonymousAsked 3w agoWhich credit card should I use for ez-link top-up monthly?I’m looking for a credit card which gives rebates/ air miles when I use to top up my ez-link. As I have a monthly reimbursement of a certain amount, I tend to maximize the top-up amount instead of using SimplyGo. I’ve tried Citibank rewards & DBS altitude, both don’t give any rewards at all. Any suggestions??2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel Choo, Finance at University College DublinLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 3w agoHi, I guess you are referring to credit cards for EZ-link transactions? There's Citi SMRT card, Stardard Chartered unlimited cashback credit card and DBS live fresh card that comes with rebates and EZ-reload. Hope that helps.0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered 6d agoHi,If the value of your top-up (and other credit expenses) add up to at least $500, to get 8.33% cashback, you can try: 1) using UOB One Card to top-up Grabpay, 2) using Grabpay Mastercard or (transfering to a friend who has it) to top-up YouTrip, and 3) using YouTrip as an EZ-Link card.I've written some explanation in this post: https://community.whatcard.sg/t/best-credit-card-to-top-up-youtrip-it-s-probably-not-the-card-you-are-thinking-of/387You can check it out.0 comments0"
