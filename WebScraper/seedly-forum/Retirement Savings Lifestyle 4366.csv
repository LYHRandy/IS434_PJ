question,"Retirement Savings Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoHow do I calculate my retirement needs for early retirement?I am looking through different blog and website on retirement needs for early retirement. I am not sure if I am looking at the wrong places, but I couldn't find enough material on how to calculate retirement needs factoring healthcare, early retirement and inflation over long periods due to longer retirement.I would like to try to calculate my own needs instead of the standard "" X times of income"".  My previous advisor doesn't seem to take my early retirement needs seriously.2 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi anon,Retirement is a matter of balancing inflow and outflow. What is early is subjective, some people wish to retire by 55 (that's considered early to them), some try to retire by 50 or even 45. I can give you some general pointers:Segregate your expenses into needs and wants. You'll want to make sure that any income source covering the needs are (mostly) guaranteed, and those that cover wants can be variable income sources. Inflate them accordingly and then make projections for your income sources so that you can know at which age, a certain income source pays. For example, dividend stocks can start paying you within a few months, whereas an annuity may only pay in 20 years time, and CPF life only starts at 65. Track and categorize your expenses and you will be able to find your numbers.There is a wealth of information out there, so you are not looking in the wrong places, but perhaps you have not found the information you are looking for. Healthcare (medical premiums) inflates differently from general spending, most numbers I've seen are in the range of 3-5% p.a, whereas essentials inflate around 2.5%. However, due to long term uncertainty, when you project the numbers for more than 40 years, they start to look uncomfortably large and with a big range of uncertainty. Do not be discouraged. Just make sure to review the figures every few years and adjust.Try to also consider the option of semi-retirement, which means that you'll have enough to get by, and perhaps can just opt for a part-time profession for a little extra cash. I know of some people in their 50s who get a decent sum from some retirement plans and dividend stocks they have put money in to tide them over, and they spend maybe 2-3 days a week working part-time, but have 4-5 days off to do what they wish, all while waiting for CPF life at 65.Sorry to hear that your previous advisor did not take your early retirement needs seriously. It is one of the more common topics that have been brought up by my clients, so I will just share the insights condensed from my conversations with them. However, this community is here to give you inputs and help, so I hope you can take away something from here.2 comments4"
2,"Question Poster3d agoThanks Elijah, the points above are good consideration points. (It is indeed the 40 years projection that gets me uncomfortable.)Elijah Lee2d agoDon't worry about the 40 year projection just yet. The figures become incomprehensible at this stage if you look forward 40 years. (Bus tickets cost like 10 cents 40 years ago, look where we are now) Focus on what you can do for yourself now. With a bit of planning and action, retirement won't look as scary as it used to be for you."
