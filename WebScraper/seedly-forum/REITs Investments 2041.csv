In the end, you might be paying more in the rights issues to not be diluted out.REITS price can also go down. Look at Sabana and Lippo Malls. High yield and look at their share prices. Your yield would not have covered the paper loss.0 comments1"

You should not choose any REITs nor stocks based on JUST dividends alone!Stocks/REITs that pay high dividends may not neccessarily be able to sustain them. There are many other factors to consider other than just dividends. Better to invest in companies/REITs with good fundamentals.0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 25 Mar 2019You should choose reits based on its ability to give dividends consistently and it being undervalued.Plus gearing needs to be of comfortable levels so that it is not overstretched and not able to borrow money to acquire more assets.0 comments0

REIT stocks pay out 90% of their income as dividends to investors. Most of the taxable income is shared as dividend. Also, REITS offer twice the amount of payouts which makes them as steady income creators.0 comments0"
