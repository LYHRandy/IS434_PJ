question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Mar 2019Am I covered for Critical Illness under Vivocare 100?Hello! Following this platform closely, and some of the common coverage recommended is Health insurance, Early Critical Illness coverage amongst others. I am currently on Vivocare 100 whole life insurance for about 7 years, and wondering if this is the same as Critical Illness Coverage. Could anyone enlighten me? Many thanks!Link available at https://income.com.sg/insurance/life-insurance/whole-life-insurance/vivocare-100/details/how-it-works1 answerAnswerBump0"

If you'd like a comparison or some advice, you can always drop me a message for a closer look. I can't fully recommend until I see your whole scenario.Question Poster11 May 2019Is it true that one can look forward to getting back the cash value if no claims are made?"
