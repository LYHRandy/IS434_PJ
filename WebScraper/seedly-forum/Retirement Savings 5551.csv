God of WisdomAnswered on 30 Dec 2018The plan does not give you a 4.75% return after 20 years. Maybe just a 3.5% return. It's a flexible endowment that acts like an ATM after the 3rd year.Has a compounded reversionary bonus benefit which means if you don't withdraw from the plan, it grows faster.it's main use is for general wealth accumulation, retirement planning, plus 3rd generation planning. If you're risk adverse, require cashflow, and want some guaranteed returns, it's a decent asset to have.0 comments0"
