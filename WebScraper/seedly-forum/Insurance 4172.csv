1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Jul 2018CDWP is actually waiver of premium (a rider add-on to the main policy), most likely critical cover waiver.​It activates mainly on conditions met based on the coverage it entitles you (depending on what rider you bought)​The common conditions that CDWP activates are as follow1) Death - If you are dead, you need to insure so that your dependents etc do not need to pay for it (payor benefit rider most of the time)2) Critical Illness - If you are gravely ill, you are unable to work and service the policy (which may only cover death or TPD). Hence adding this rider will remove the fear of unable to service. (critical cover waiver of premium).0 comments0"
