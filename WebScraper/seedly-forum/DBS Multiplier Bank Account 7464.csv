question,DBS Multiplier Bank Account Asked by Kelvin SohAsked on 09 Mar 2019What are the available ways to fully utilize the DBS Multiplier?Just read the fine print on how DBS Multiplier calculates its' interest but I had already opened a DBS Multiplier account. My dilemma is that my salary only credits on the 25th of every month.. which means I only get to enjoy 5-6 days of higher interest every month which is a bummer. Any finance/bank wise people that can shed some light on what my options are? Thanks in advance!3 answersAnswerBump1

Get salary, leave some in there for the next month, then you will have the full month interest. Use only what is required for bills, expenses etc. Multiplier interest only applies to first 50k, so keep building up towards that goal. As long as your average daily balance keeps increasing, your interest earned will also increase.0 comments1"

RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019But that means I only get the base interest rate of 0.05% every month till the 25th, then my interest rate increases to 1.85% or more (cause of salary credit being on 25th) which means I am only getting 5 days of higher interest?Not sure if I am reading the T&C right here Haha.1 comment0"
4,"Kelvin Soh12 Mar 2019For anyone else confused by the same issue this is the formula I got from DBS / POSB.

Monthly Calculation of Interest:
Daily calculation of Base Interest: 0.05% x Daily balance / 365 days x (number of days in the month)
Preferential Calculation is done at the end of the month: 1.80% x Daily Balance / 365 ... (more)"
