1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 06 May 2019I would say to pay more attention to the cashflow statements of the company, especially their operating and investing cashflows. Dividend Payout Ratio looks at Net Profit as the basis of comparison, but net profits and cash flow are different. Moreover, dividends paid out are usually based on cash flow and not just profits. Also, it would be good to take a look at the cash balance the company has, and compare it with their cashflow statements. Companies might still pay out dividends even if cash flows aren't looking too good for a speicific year because they have a lot of cash on hand.0 comments1"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 May 2019For me I use s-reits in my income floor portfolio for dividends. I look at the sponsor firm, how stable the dividends were in the past, and stock price trend over time. Business model is important as well. Don't just look at dividend yield. Good example of a cautionary tale would be Asian Pay Television Trust0 comments0"

How much dividends are you going for?For myself I go with blue chip companies like Capitaland, Singtel or DBS etc. They payout decent dividends and are quite stable.1 comment0"
