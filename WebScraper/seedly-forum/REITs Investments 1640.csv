1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Apr 2019Hello! According to a bloomberg report, S-REITs offer yields exceeding those listed in Australia, US and Japan. One reason why S-REITs are able to pay higher dividends is due to the regulation for S-REITs to distribute at least 90% of taxable income each year to enjoy the tax exempt status by IRAS. The S-REIT sector is the 6th largest globally, with a market capitalization of US$53 billion. UK REITs has the largest market cap standing at $3.4 trillion capturing 6.3% market share. In Asia, S-REIT is the third largest REIT market after Japan and Australia.0 comments1"
