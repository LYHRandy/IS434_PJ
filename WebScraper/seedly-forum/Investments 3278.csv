1,"Cherie Julianne TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 06 Oct 2018Hello! It does not require monthly contribution! ðŸ™‚Every SSB issuance happens every month with,Min amount: $500Max amount: $100K (in multiples of $500)*Do note that you might not be allocated the amount that you applied for! Example, you applied to play your $10,000 into SSB, on the results day, you might only be allocated $6,000?â€‹More Reads:Choosing Fixed Deposits or SSB - where you can read more pros and cons of each, and how much interest you should be expecting if you withdraw your SSB early.Some additional tips to help hack your SSB game - knowing that SSB interest rate changes every month, how can you as a consumer work around it to better optimise your investment!Hope this helps.

2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The minimum is 500 to start, yes. Each month there will be a new ssb issue with different rates, so there's no need to contribute every month unless you intend to buy into a different issue with different coupon rates every time. 2 comments1"
3,"Zach Howe24 Oct 2018I have a question. Say I started out with $500 first, and a couple of months later, I have decided to deposit in another $500.

For the new $500, do I have to perform another purchase of the SSB, or is it an automated process where the bank/ whichever platform that will do the purchase for me?Jonathan Chia Guangrong25 Oct 2018You will need to apply manually for each new month that you want to buy into SSB. Not like an 'account' per se where you top up the initial 500. Basically it's a new tranche every month with different rates "

5,"Hannah FooLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 Jun 2018No monthly contribution. You just have to keep the money there, the longer it's held the higher the interest earned. Every 6 months there'll be a payout.0 comments1"
