Though, its important to know what you want to cover.(1) Do you have any expensive items to have coverage like paintings, gold, IPhone X that cost more than $1,000? these need to be submitted to the insurer for validation for coverage.(2) Some membership may give you discount (etc aviva mindef have housing insurance further discount).(3) Items do have depreciation, so if possible, do keep reciepts of those that is of great value to you.Do your due diligence first to check what type of content you want to cover before buying and deciding on it.0 comments0"
