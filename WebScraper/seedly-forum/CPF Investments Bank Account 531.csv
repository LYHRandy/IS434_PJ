What you are facing will be(1) Political Risk of Change to CPF rules vs(2) Having enough moneyBeing a Self-employed means your Voluntary Contributions can enjoy tax savings. I would start doing when I hit the 11.5% tax bracket to lower it to the 7% tax bracket.It is wise to do it if you feel your investment cannot hit 5% (since first $60,000 in SA and MA earns 5% interest), and you wish to have some funds to buy housing, (while also wants some accrued interest so that you can contribute later to OA for 55 years SA Shielding).I would treat SA as a bond portfolio that can mature in 55 years if you contribute enough to hit Full Retirement Sum (FRS).Do remember to report your income from P2P lending as they are taxable income.0 comments0"

I am also having spare cash in my multiplier account to have higher interest (40% of my total assets).Please help me as I am very confused by all the information and I am afraid that when I contribute to CPF I will no longer see the money. Thank you in advance!1 comment0"

Now CPF is great when you already have it, but it's not necessary if you don't have it.

In fact, without CPF, I'm able to take more risk with my money and have a higher expected weighted return from my entire portfolio.
