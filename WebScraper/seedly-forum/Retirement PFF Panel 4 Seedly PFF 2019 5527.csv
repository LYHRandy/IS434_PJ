1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Haha when I was single and even after I got married, I was in the smaller house camp.Now with a kid, I realised I prefer a bigger space because I want to have a teaching (and later study) room for him. Plus my husband is the only son so we need to have our in-laws stay with us to look after them. And I'm the only one supporting my father. Therefore now we need a minimum of a 5-room flat, if not bigger. 1 room for us, 1 room for kid, 1 room for in-laws, and 1 room for my dad.But I'm also in early retirement camp (hopefully before 45). So how to answer your question ah, I also dunno lol.0 comments0"
