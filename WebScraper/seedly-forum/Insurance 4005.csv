I think paying annual has some slight discount.i only pay for my AVIVA army insurance monthly... and i choose to tag it to my debit account, as i’m afraid of missing insurance premiums.and also when i cancel my credit cards, i dont wanna have to pick up too much pieces!0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 28 Nov 2018Yes you usually get a 2-3% discount when paying annually. Plus if you're paying with credit card for your first year, you can utilise your CC benefits.In fact, some banks even allow you to split your yearly payments to months with no cost, so that's a easy way to save some money on your first year premium. 0 comments0"
