Takes time to acquire its initial patient base and new housing estates require time to be fully populated.2-6 years: highest growth rates as this age profile reflects the phase of patient acquisition and increasing population as the housing estates mature.6 years: slowest growth rates or may even decline due to the matured profile of the housing estates. Revenue may also be adversely affected when patients change their residency away from matured housing estates. (But if they have a large patient base that is already stable, slow growth rates doesn’t affect that much)What are they going to do with the proceeds from this IPO?Expand our Group’s business through (i) the expansion of our network of self-owned GP clinics, specialist care services and medical facilities in Singapore as well as (ii) acquisitions, joint ventures and/or strategic alliances (47% or $3mil)Invest in technology systems as part of the digital transformation of the delivery of healthcare services (8% or $0.5mil)Expand our pharmaceutical services business (3% or $0.2mil)For general working capital requirements (13% or $0.8mil)For payment of underwriting and placement commissions as well as listing expenses (29% or $1.9mil)Business StrategyRisksSubject to government laws and regulationsDependent on key relationships with insurance companies for patient volumeMay not be able to sustain past growth ratesOpportunitiesEscalating costs of private healthcareAgeing population driving up demand for healthcareEconomic Growth and Rising Income Levels Will Help Increase Healthcare SpendingIncreasing Population of Foreigners in SingaporeGovernment going towards making Singapore a MedTech HubComment down below why you're subscribing or not subscribing!0 comments5"
2,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 29 May 2019Probably pass due to the red flags and current market emotions being low. Majority of market share is in Singapore, which means competition would be intense. The consolation point would be that they have tried to expand overseas, which leads to the next point. If you look at the revenue portfolio from 3M18 vs 3M19, it seems to revert back to SG market, rather than expansion. If you look at the FYs, it seems like expansion from FY 16 to 17, but slight consolidation from FY17 to 18, with the “loss” of Thailand market, while HK has reduced. Interestingly, other market have increased. However, if you look at 3M18 VS 3M19, other market share has actually reduced from 10.1 to 3.1 Not sure if SGD appreciated significantly against others or is it due to change in market shares.0 comments3"
