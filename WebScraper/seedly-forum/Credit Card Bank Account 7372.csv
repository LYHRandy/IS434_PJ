question,"Credit Card Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Jun 2019Why should I spend more by getting a credit card? Am I trapping myself to a cycle of spending when I don't have to? ?I have been thinking a lot about living a meaningful life with less, and the more I read about credit cards and the minimum spending required for cashback and miles and etc, the more I have a headache.I think I spend only about $500 a month for all my expenses and groceries. Bills for the home are split across all family members contributing. Should I just not have a credit card then? Interested to hear from you!6 answersAnswerBump1"

God of WisdomUpdated on 02 Jul 2019You can consider limiting your credit limit so that you will not overspend. For me, if the amount I have to pay by cash is the same as that of paying by credit card, then the main draw of the credit card would be rewards like miles or cashback. Might as well get some reward instead of leaving it on the table. And most importantly, don't force yourself to spend just for the purpose of meeting some minimum spend. That takes self discipline. Do take some time to look at what credit card may suit your expenditure patterns.The most important thing about using credit cards is paying your bill in full. Then you will have no worries. Annual fees can usually be waived.3 comments11"

3,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 01 Jul 2019There are credit cards that would not require the min spend. But that would also mean the cashback/miles/rewards is lower.For myself, I have my fixed expenses (monthly insurance premiums and bills) to pay. So I pay them via UOB One as it requires consistent spending ($50 for spend of $500 for 3 consecutive months, $100 for spend of $1000 for 3 consecutive months and $300 for spend of $2000 for 3 consecutive months)For other expenses such as shopping, transport, I have the standard chartered spree card (3% cashback on foreign currency, 2% for online spend (local), contactless payment and mobile payment and 1% for all other retail spend)Apply for a credit card that would best fit your usual spending patterns. Pay off your credit card bills on time and you will have a good credit score to ease your application for future loans approval from banks (mortgage etc)Also if you have high interest saving account, you can pair it with a credit card for higher interest.

5,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Jul 2019I agree with you re: the minimum spend component, and find that too many people are chasing to hit the minimum spend in other to get perks like miles etc.
Ultimately, it boils down to an issue of self control.
For me, after doing a few months of trying to hit a 2k monthly expenditure, I just found that it was really not worth the hassle. And when I looked at my average monthly expenses (even inclusive of groceries for family), I was only hitting $500-600 a month.
That said, I still use a credit card (ONE) for the following reasons:I still can hit the $500 minimum spend tier without having to intentionally purchase moreI like to have the benefit of seeing all my CC expenses in one place.I like to use Fave and Grab for food to accumulate points (I would have spent the same in cash anyway), and these transactions can be charged to credit cards0 comments1"

Spend within your means and what you buy should mean something to you, either you need it or it brings you the joy without overstretching yourself.
I would rather have the peace of mind than trying to keep thinking the minimum I have to spend in order to qualify for the rebates.1 comment1"

8,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Jul 2019To us, getting a credit card (cc) is for:1) Cash back2) Miles point for travel ticket redemptionIf you don't travel much and find to plan / track the spending to hit min spending to get either (1) or (2) above a hassle, then probably not.  These days the cask back were very little, and min spending has been steadily increasing from $600 to $800 and above.  So not much gain there for cash back.
For me, to get most of the cc is to get all the benefits, discount , 1 for 1 deals whenever available, some savings here and there (for those who don't mind the hassle of handling the number of credit cards / bills)
If your intention is to live a meaningful life with less, then why not consider just use 1 card and tie all spending to it only. Simply set GIRO to auto pay the cc bill monthly and forget about it.  Forget about all the other benefits as they might not worth more than a simplistic / minimal lifestyle that could gives more peaceful and focus life.
Cheers for minimal life (easy with least maintenace and more focus)! :)0 comments0"
9,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 03 Jul 2019Dont spend for the sake of getting rebate or rewards / miles, but only if there are clear benefits in rearranging your expenses.I long thought it was foolish to spend an additional 200 for one mth, and if I didnt spend that, I wasnt entitled to the bonus interest, which was less than 50. It just made sense to skip the bonus interest.For my own credit card spending, initially I started out small, then racked more and more household bills onto my credit cards, as I do analyze my credit card spend, been using the Money Insights and expense categorization tools to split them out and look for cost reduction opportunities. If I get extra cashback in the interim, why not? But if I decide those expenses should be cut, the rewards shouldnt be a justification for keeping the spend.Note 1: Through the spend analysis, I have since then cut a couple of hundred / maybe 1+k of expenses, scrutinizing over the cable tv / mobile phone / shopping expenses as I set annual targets for cost reduction, amd cut out things we were paying for but not really using. My goals now are more geared to reducing wastage.Note 2: I eventually skipped UOB one card because there were quarters where I spend high in two mths and didnt need to spend so much on the third. It was so agonizing to either ration my expenses (how you split travel or dental costs), or think about spending more to qualify, it was just easier to switch to a card that still gives cashback on variable spending.2 comments0"
10,"Question Poster03 Jul 2019Oh man, the UOB one card was something I might consider. Didn't know of the quarters requirement of think of how to ration the expenses. Thanks for sharing!T@Takingstock @03 Jul 2019In the end, the credit card program has to be profitable. There's a cost somehow for your spend, either trying to get you spend more to hit higher average spend or qualify for some reward, or just plain low rewards. I also hate those rewards w expiry.

I just aim to get one that's more aligned to my spend patterns."
