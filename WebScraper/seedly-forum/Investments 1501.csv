1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Apr 2019Hello! The main reasons include different capital intensity levels between industries and whether the nature of the business makes carrying a high level of debt relatively easier to manage. Capital-intensive industries, such as oil, gas or telecommunications, require significant financial resources and large amounts of money to produce goods or services. If a company's performance is not subjected to fluctuation accordingly to the economy, it tends to be able to carry larger amounts of debt at a lower risk. For instance, industries that have a stable demand for their goods and services such as utilities, manufacturing tend to have higher debt-to-equity ratios.0 comments0"
