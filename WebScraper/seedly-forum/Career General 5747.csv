question,"Career General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Apr 2019I am rather new in​ the workplace and had been finding ways to better communicate with my colleagues. What were some of the things you did in the initial starting years of work that was​ helpful?​I am an introvert by nature, however, I realized that getting to know people or the right people can help make my work a lot easier. I had been given advice such as finding common ground and also chatting up with people in the pantry. I had been doing that, however, the rate at which I am progressing is slow. In today's fast-paced culture, I feel like I need to be faster.3 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Apr 2019Just be yourself and be nice. You should have teammates or people who are seated physically near you - observe them and spot for common grounds. Do not try too hard because it may creep people out. You can make friends even in the washroom or pantry but keep a smile always~If you're looking for mentorship, you can ask things like ""do you know who is good with xxx around here?"" Or ""I understand you are good at xxx, I am new to it.. do you mind if we exchange ideas?""Hope this helps and please upvote me if you find it useful! Do not hesitate to ask more though. It can be daunting for the first time which I can understand.0 comments1"
