1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018The best way to clear a $20,000 credit card is to work very, very hard. If you need to, take up 2 or 3 jobs to clear it. The high interest rate of credit card debt works strongly against you. There are free social services out there that can help with debt counselling and negotiate with credit card companies to lower the charges and you should quickly leverage on these services. In short,I will try to clear this debt as soon as I can.I also do not think that taking a personal loan is a good idea.0 comments1"
