question,Debt Loans Asked by AnonymousAsked on 10 Aug 2019Should I approach debt settlement companies to make my mom's debt repayment easier?I just started work and trying to clear my mum's loan (from HL finance) of more than $50k (borrowed to finance her HDB flat purchase) when I saw online that there are companies offering debt repayment schemes. Should I arrange an appointment with them or continue to payment to HL finance as per normal? And are there any downsides to joining a debt repayment scheme?2 answersAnswerBump0
