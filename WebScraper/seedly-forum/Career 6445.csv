1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Apr 2019You’re the average of all the people who surround you. Take a look around and make sure you’re in the right surroundings.But of course its not so simple to distance yourself from a co-worker, especially if the both of you are tasked with working on a project together. Ultimately, you should not let the negativity affect you. True, it is easier said than done. Here are some ways that you can consider to deal with it:1. SET BOUNDARIESOnly engage this co-worker only when you need to (ie. discussing work), and distance yourself when this co-worker is looking to chit-chat (read: massively complaining and being negative about work) 2. BE UPFRONT However, if you do indeed care for this co-worker as a friend, you could be honest with him/her and talk about how the complaining and negativity is not only bad for himself/herself, but also to his peers. You never know, you could be the positive force and turn things around. It probably will take some time though.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 19 Apr 2019Hi there, waa I can feel you being stressed all the way from where I am hahaha but okay hope the answers will help you in one way or another. TL:DR, Proceed with solutions that are within your control. There will be solutions that are within your control and those that are not. For practicality, let's unfold the solutions that you have control over since it's tough to interfere with factors you can't control... Let me further group the two types of solutions into a long term and short term solution.For short term solutions which means that the proposed solution might help you alleviate the problem only temporarily. Some things I can think of and which you might want to explore would be:1) Distancing yourself from himBy doing this, you do not have to be affected by his negativity and you can instead surround yourself with people who can bring out the best in you. 2) Alter the topic of conversationRecognise that he is such a person and do not add fuel into the fire. If you know he is such a person, don't give him an opportunity to express that negativity. Discuss about other things. If he finds negativity not only in work but is just super negative in everything, then you can probably go back to point 1 HAHA3) Discuss with the manager about itThis point is not so much about complaining and sabo-ing him so that he is seen in a bad light. If you dig one level deeper, this negativity might be a result ofa. workload being too much b. he finds that the things he do is not meaningful c. other reasons. The manager might be able to help alter his negative mindset by finding out more and taking up the appropriate measures.For the longer term solutions, you can try to take the time and effort to find out more This tackles the root of the problem. After finding out more as to why he is being so negative, you can as best as you can help him along the way to see things in a more positive light.All in all, if it's in you to help people then maybe you could try helping him rather than just distancing yourself from him and letting him continue being this way. Hope this helps!0 comments1"

The see no motivation and purpose, and they are likely to be complaining about their 'predicament'. There's two ways to handle the issue:Motivate your colleague. Let him see the meaning behind the work and if he does, your life at work will be much more smooth sailingIgnore him. All of us have different mental models from different experiences and upbringing. Sometimes it is very very hard to change someone's perceived notion. Just because what you think is right does not mean that has to the same for him.0 comments0"
