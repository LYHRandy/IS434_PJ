Grand MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2019You are comparing Basics vs HonoursUK vs Australia.If it's me, I will prefer the UK, as the diversity in London alone is more wide and deep than even Singapore (if you think Singapore is multi-racial, wait till you arrive in London)There is so much to glean and absorb by being in London itself.(Wait I just realised you could be getting the degree in Open University in Singapore, so may not have the opportunity to fly over to study, but still, I think the UK brand is more largely recognised)I am not sure if the cost is a factor, as the UK stuff is probably a lot more expensiveBritish Pounds  Australia Dollar0 comments0"
2,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Oct 2018Australia's college education system has more breath in terms of its curriculum whereas British's college education system has more depth in terms of its curriculum. It is not necessarily true that UK honours degree is better than a basic degree,especially if you are working in the private sector. However, in the civil service, UK honours degree will allow one to have a starting pay. Please correct me if I am wrong. 0 comments0"
