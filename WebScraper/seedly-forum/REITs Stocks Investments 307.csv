1,"Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Jun 2019On how to determine whether a REIT is overvalued, I look at the P/B ratio. P/B ratio for strong REITS such as CMT, MCT, AREIT, MLT or MIT are now hovering at 1.25-1.3 level or even higher. I won't invest in REITS now because of the margin of safety is kinda weak because you are buying at the peak. When REITS fall, your distributions will not be able to cover fully. Last saturday, I read an article from Financial Horse.Financial Horse uses both price to book ratio and yield spread to determine whether the REIT is overvalued. The yield spread is basically the difference in yield for Singapore REITs versus a 10-year Singapore Savings Bonds. The average yield for Singapore REITs is about 5.8%, the 10 year SSB is about 2.2%, which works out to an average yield spread of 3.6%.The historical range is 2.1% to 5.6%, and the median is 3.8%, so we’re only slightly below the middle, but well within historical norms.So based on yield spreads, Singapore REITs as an asset class are still looking pretty decently valued.However, not all REITS are created equally, there are some REITS that laggard behind despite the rally since 2019. So I suggest looking at individual REITS yield spread instead of a whole in general.0 comments3"
2,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Jun 2019I have come to the conclusion that P/B is sometimes a tricky indicator, that could be potentially ignored for reits. When I compared Keppel DC (kdc) reit against Mapletree Industrial Reit (mint), Because kdc has a lot of freehold land, it has a higher P/B value. Its not something to compare directly.I have switched to using estimated dividend yield, net profit margin, roe, revenue growth, gti score and d/e as preferred indicators. Using sgx stockfacts, the dividend yield and net profit margin has to be manually recalcuated to account for new properties, and net profit margin should be reduced for property sales.At the moment, most reits are at an all time high, and its difficult to recommend buying now. My current consideration (at minimum) is (on unadjusted sgx stockfacts): dividend yield > 5% and less than 8.5%, roe > 7%, gti score > 75, d/e < 55%, revenue growth > 0%.You will find it leaves very few reits. Do take note of scrip dividends, some may like it, I am undecided for now.0 comments2"
3,"Arpita MukherjeeLevel 2. RookieUpdated 5d agoYes, you should definitely invest in REITs.You might ask if it is better than investing in real estate. Investing in real estate is no new concept, except it’s a pricey one. Real-estate investment as an idea sounds lucrative, but investors find it much too troublesome, especially when they are planning a sale amid a market shift. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), on the other hand, has been a major pacifier. Not only does it generate steady income but it also gives investors exposure to capital appreciation over a period of time as the value of the property increases.Listed below are points to show how REITs help investors:High Yield – REITs generate a higher income ratio since 90% of their taxable income goes out to their shareholders/investors in the form of dividends. This, in turn, increases the yield.Tax Advantage – REITs have a great tax advantage, meaning they are not taxed on the corporate level. This is considering that most of their earnings are directly passed on to their shareholders. However, investors do need to pay taxes on dividend income and capital gains from sales of the REITs.Portfolio Diversification – REITs are a good portfolio diversifier, given their returns have a low correlation to equity stocks and fixed-income investments. Also since rental income and expenses are predictable over the short and long term, REIT share prices are less volatile than equity stocks.Total Return – Not only do long-term leases ensure a continued income flow, but their returns also capture the price appreciation of the underlying REIT properties. And since properties have a high return potential, the top-performing REITs show strong returns and have the ability to outperform even the stock index.Liquidity: Real estate investment is non-liquid. But over a period of time, REITs are expected to become liquid assets, just like mutual funds.I work at Kristal.AI, and my mojo is to help people make the right financial decisions. If you think I helped you, do give me ""Thumbs up"". If you think my response was biased let me know, I will work on it.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 11 Jun 2019You have to do your own homework but i would say that both will burst together in the event of recession.It depends on whether you can hold on for long and whether you prefer dividend yields opposed  to capital gains.0 comments1"
5,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Jun 2019The general consensus is yes, but if you think about it Tech has been overvalued for decades. It's not good to group them up anyway - it's better to look at some of the individual REITs much like you'd look at individual stocks rather than them as an entire category. Historical returns show you the promise of REITs without timing your entry, which you really are encouraged NOT to do. You could experience a 40% drawdown on your capital and still have made a ton of money prior to that and after that. Eventually there will be an inevitable correction or bubble burst as you mention, but it's typically not a good idea to try and predict when it'll happen.0 comments1"
