question,"Investments REITs Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 May 2019Is it wise to buy the various REITs now since most of them are at their 52 weeks high(MCT, MLT, MIT, Ascendas REIT, FCT)? We always talk about buying low. sell high to get the most out of our investments. Not really trying to time the market here but I just don't want to buy these REITs when it's so expensive.3 answersAnswerBump2"

Because we never know when they will fall in price. Could be another 10 years for all we know, and if we did not enter, we would have lost out on 10 years of gains.Position sizing is the key as well. When markets are all time highs, enter small. Set a threshold of how much drop that you will enter the next tranche.0 comments1"

Maybe except MLT as that may still have a bit of leg to it. No telling how markets will react now.I'll suggest building up a cash holding and wait for a correction. If you really want to go in, start with perhaps a small dca amount monthly. But please do your own due diligence first0 comments0"
