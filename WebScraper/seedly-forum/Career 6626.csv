question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Oct 2018What should I choose: a good boss or better opportunity?I am currently employed in a very small company with only 7 people. I love my boss. He cares for us even outside work. However, I think I am not growing. Also, the salary is small. But a big opportunity came. A multi-national company is offering me a job that doubles my salary and career growth is also good. Should I accept it even my boss is too good to leave?4 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 29 Oct 2018If you really value the company and you feel taht the boss is a big factor of job satisfaction, then why not ask the boss if there are bigger jobscopes and more things you can do, so that you are forced out of your comfort zone, and can learn more as well?If the boss likes it comfortable, and you want to grow, then sure, move to the bigger company! Who's to say you won't meet a better boss who both cares for you, and still is able to take you to new heights and new abilities. Not only will you grow personally, but also grow financially.I just want to put it out there that ""nice boss"" doesn't mean ""good boss"". It's great to have a nice boss, but you won't be challenged by someone just being ""nice""Think about which you rather have, and go for it!0 comments4"

MasterAnswered on 29 Oct 2018I think we all reach a point in our career where are overly comfortable and no longer growing. It is good that you realize this and i feel that we should always be challenged to improve ourselves and pick up new skill sets. Since the MNC is offering double your salary, this is the perfect chance to bump up the salary and also grow in a different environment.Judging from what you post your relationship with the boss is good, that being the case you should be upfront and let him know of your decision earlier rather than later.If you boss truely cares about your development and well being than he will wish you all the best.0 comments0"
