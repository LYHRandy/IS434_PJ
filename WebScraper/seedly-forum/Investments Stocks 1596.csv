Depending on your desired outcome, your portfolio strategy will be different; and of course you must accept the relevant risk that comes with every portfolio.The kind of assets classes you wish to own will also be different depending on your desired outcome. Life stages/age often plays a part in the asset class that one wish to own too.A 30 plus adult will love to own properties and rent them out for income. 
But a 70 year old person might not want to do that, as it may be tiring to be always searching for tenant (occupany risk) and having to keep the property maintain regularly.Hence he/she might then switch the asset classes for something else to continue to enjoy the income that will be generated.0 comments2"
