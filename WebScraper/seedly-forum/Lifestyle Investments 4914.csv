WizardAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Actionable way to do this:Months left: 7Target: $5,000 - I am assuming your total savings target is $15k, of which you already have 2/3Amount to be saved per month: $714Assuming you are a student - find an internship or side gig (for eg. private tuition) that pays you enough to save that $714 a month PLUS your living expenses. If the $15k amount is a die-die-must-have, then I would not recommend investing since returns are not definite. A job where you deliver, and can hold for 7 months, would get you to your $15k total goal.0 comments2"

Normal part time jobs usually pay less than $15/hr! You need average $714/mth to achieve yout financial goal!If you have skills, find a freelance job that offers good offers. Its killing two birds in one stone. Not only you get to showcase your talent/skills, you also get to money!0 comments1"

Investments is only when you have additional spare cash in hand. Kudos to you.. savings to a amount of $10,000. Sad to say many adults don't even have this kind of savings. The more you earn the more you spend as all the expenses from housings..car..kids expenses all come in. Savings a monthly $714 is not a easy task. Follow Junus Eu advice definitely is a good way.0 comments1"
4,"Benny TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Be very disciplined! By straight line calculation it's $714 per month, so you gotta ask yourself what you have to sacrifice now, so that your later event materialises. Be comfortable with delayed gratification - it'll serve you well. Assuming that your 5k target is just to make it happen, you should also consider if you want or are able to save more to be able to spend better while you're at it.0 comments1"
