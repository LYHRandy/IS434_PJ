1,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 06 Sep 2019Definition of “better” is subjective. More interest gained? The criteria for getting higher interest being lax or easy to achieve based on your financial status? Debit cards being used for shopping, promotion or whatsoever? Lower min amount? Is the 35k fixed or going to increase? Are you gonna do any kinda investments, insurance, salary crediting? All these matters. If you’re talking about interest,You can be a little more diligent by going to DBS multiplier, OCBC 360, UOB One websites and punch the numbers into the calculators and you’ll know which is/are good for you. CIMB doesn’t have much of a requirement, is also quite easy to understand and you can just use any compound interest calculator online to find out the interests you’ll get too.0 comments2"
