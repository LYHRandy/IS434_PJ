Are you someone who cannot help but feel anxious when an investment turns sour on paper?Next would be your personality type when it comes handling money. This is not necessary but it'll help you understand yourself better and why you react the way you do.Once you know your risk profile, then you can look at the type of investment instruments that are suitable for you. 
Conservative profile: bonds, Singapore Savings Bonds, fixed deposits, high yielding savings accountsBalanced profile: mix of above and stocks Aggressive profile: more of stocks, derivatives, private equity, angel investing. Less of bonds and similar instruments in this mix.These are just personal opinion and does not constitute as financial advice. Hope this helps0 comments0"
