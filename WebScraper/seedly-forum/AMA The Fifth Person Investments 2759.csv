1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Feb 2019Hi,When you are young, your capital to invest is generally limited. Investing for growth make more sense than investing for dividend. As you grow older, dividend income is important because you do not want to keep working and passive income can help to sustain your lifestyle. 0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 20 Feb 2019As a good rule of thumb, your % of exposure to bonds in your portfolio should match you age.When you're 25, having a 25% bond 75% equity portfolio is good if you're saving for retirement in 30-40 years.When you're 50, it might be better to go 50% Bond 50% Equity. And in your retire at 65, 65% bond, 35% equity.Anothe framework I use, is an expected return framework.The formula is investment horizon in years / 2 (high risk) 3 (balanced risk) or 4 (low risk).So if I'm planning to retire in 30 years, I should expect my portfolio to generate 7.5/10/15% returns and I shall allocate accordingly.If I'm saving for a wedding in 5 years and I'll need to liquidate all my positions for it, I should only expect my portfolio to generate 1.25-2.5% returns. Anything higher, I may have a loss of capital. But keeping it in a bank will also be too low and I should at least put in a bond fund or buy SSBs for it.0 comments0"

With increased expected spending in shorter term than longer term horizons, individuals would prefer their money to stay more liquid- diversifying their portfolio in a wide range of assets and ensuring maturity of assets are varied tailored to their forecasted spendings.With growing size of CPF savings-savvy individuals will also look to make purchases- be it downpayment of housing or investments- to capitalize on that sum of money.Investment wise- although varied based on individual- stable consistent returns become increasingly more attractive- rendering dividend investing much more attractive rather than capital gains in more risky growth and value stocks.With stable income, individuals also start considering more health insurance plans to compensate uncertainties in their future health, and tend to spend more on insurance plan premiums as they age.0 comments0"
