Most people start out similar to you too. Are you studying now or working?If you are still studying, I say focus on your studies and slowly build up your knowledge in finance. Don‚Äôt rush it and don‚Äôt let your dollar amount in the bank dejects you. If you are working, then let me KISS it for you (Keep It Simple and Stupid)Protect your future and Pay yourself first (get your insurances and set aside a % of your salary for your future)Focus on increasing your income (be it through your work or other platforms, basically invest in yourself)Diversify and grow your portfolio. (Get your money working harder for you!)Just 3 pointers. Keeping it simple for you. üëçüèª0 comments3"
2,"John SmithsLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 20 Apr 2019If you have no viable skill sets to start a business, your first step is to find a job with a decent salary income. Then learn how to structure and budget for your spending, saving and investing on things like credit cards, bank accounts and expense management. This will allow you to start building up your basic financial skills.Before you even start thinking about how to build passive income such as interest and dividend, you first need active income. Don't think so far ahead about being financially free when you have yet to take the first step. Be patient.0 comments1"

Or at least that's what I am a product of, and only after graduating did I start giving more thought to my finances and planning for my future after a family member got diagnosed with critical illness.All the other answers here are extremely valuable and definitely point you in the right direction. An actionable way to get started about your finances (not even talking about more complex topics like insurance and investments) is to first MANAGE YOUR MONEY.Can't stress this enough, because often times we're spending money we don't know if we have. But a good budgeting habit (it involves no more than 5-10 mins of your day) can set a strong foundation for more to come.You can try out the Seedly app :)0 comments0"
