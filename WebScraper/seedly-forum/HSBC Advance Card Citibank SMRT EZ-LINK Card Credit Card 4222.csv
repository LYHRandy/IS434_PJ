1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019HSBC advance card is not an unlimited cashback card. They have a cap on the cashback per month, even for advance banking clients.​Plus, if you are not an advance banking client, you would not get subsequent card fee waiver if you do not spend at least $12k a year.​Citi SMRT card is also good but its not actual cashback as in real cash credited to your account. The rebate comes in the form of SMRT$ which is a rewards program.​Some people prefer to get actual cashback credit rather than collecting rewards points.1 comment1"

3,"Alex Trüng Huỳnh, Consulting at Financial ServicesLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 24 Jan 2019Cash Back is capped at S$70 per calendar month. For HSBC Advance banking  customers, Cash Back is capped at S$125 per calendar month.Assume if you are Advance customer, you need to spend c. S$3600 for S$125 cash back monthly. With this spending, with Amex or StanChart you get like S$54 at 1.5% rate. Get this one if you think it fits your monthly spending bill.0 comments0"
