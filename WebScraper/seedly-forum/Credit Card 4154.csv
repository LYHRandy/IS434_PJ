1,"TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Yes but its not earned per trip. Its earned once every few days (only the first trip)For example:
The first trip i tapped on Wednesday i get 10-30  points. (Depending on your tier)
Then afterwards for the rest of the trips on Wednesday i dont get any points. 
Thursday I tapped also no points.
But then after a few days later, i get the points again for the first tap.0 comments0"
