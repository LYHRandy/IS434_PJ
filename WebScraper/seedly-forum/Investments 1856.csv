1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hello! The one-day spike on April's Fool was caused by a huge order placed by a mystery buyer. A single order worth about $100 million had spread across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges through the world at the same time. However, there are 3 possible reasons for the rally in prices. A technical move: $80 million sell wall at $4,200 absorbed by buyers, $500 million worth of short contracts on BitMEX squeezed out, fueling the rally of bitcoin. In other words, key resistance led sell walls to fall, short contracts to be liquidated and retail investors to demonstrate fear of missing out, thus causing bitcoin to increase by 19% Intensifying Interest: Buy volume of bitcoin on Binance achieved an all-time high, this rapid rising volume demonstrates interest of retail investors are rising once again. Industry development: In synergy with price trend of cryptocurrencies, the industry has seen progress in areas that needed much improvement (institutionalization and merchant adoption). For instance, the largest e-commerce platform in Switzerland accepted cryptocurrency payments and a luxury Swiss hotel integrated cryptocurrency payment methods.0 comments1"
