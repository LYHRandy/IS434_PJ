1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 06 Mar 2019Very interesting piece of news- one interesting point I learnt was that Legoland Malaysia is owned by Sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd , chaired by Mahathir Muhammad (think of it like GIC), but operated by Merlin Entertainments Plc- a UK listed company managing resorts and themed parks globally.Personally, I've been to the park once when it was relatively new- and never again since. Its target audience mostly appealed to families with young kids under 12, and as a teen then, the rides were extremely unsatisfying.Doesn't come as a surprise the park must be struggling to churn profits- or even making losses after Khazanah reported weak results for the year- with portfolio asset value dropping from RM157mil to RM136mil last year alone. Indeed this doesnt bode well not just for Malaysia's tourism industry, but should be worrying for the whole country given its sovereign fund would probably contribute to its national budget. With Mahatir still steering the country back from former PM Najib's billion dollar govt deficit, the macro outlook of Malaysia's economy doesnt look promising...0 comments0"
