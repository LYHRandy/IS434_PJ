1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Jan 2019As you have some big ticket items to spend on in the next few years, I would suggest putting your money into safer instruments such as Singapore Savings Bond, High interest savings account, or Fixed Deposit. This will ensure minimal/no capital loss when you need the cash in the near future, while earning you some interest at the same time.In the long run, you might want to look at endowment plans (I have little knowledge on these, so you might want to research on them before putting your money in), or bonds (again, do your own research before putting your money in).0 comments0"
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Make sure you have your essential insurance such as hospitalization and life insurance. You can also have a look at critical illness insurance to see if you need it. Make sure you have a 6 months expenses emergency fund. (can be more than 6 months if having more money for emergency makes you feel better and safer) Make use of high interest savings account such as UOB one, DBS Multiplier and so on. Risk averse people can consider Singapore Saving Bonds or even top up their cpf special account for retirement but remember you cant withdraw until 55. There is also Citi maxigain accout that gives quite high interest but minimum 70k and cannot withdraw. (good for future most likely not right now)1 comment0"

4,"Zin HtooLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Jan 2019Hi. I'm Zin a financial consultant at AIA. As a believer of delegating and making my money work harder for me, I would advise that you do not put all your eggs in one basket by investing in only one fund i.e equities, bonds etc.. that seems safe. Thus, as a risk adverse person, you can look at a few options.1) Invest in the safe funds such as the ST index that allows you to have a safety net. Upon which you can always invest the remainder of your money in a slightly riskier fund for the possibility of better returns. The downside to this however, is that you manage your own funds.2) Buy an short term endowment plan which offers guaranteed and non guaranteed returns. This will not only protect your funds but allow you to grow your money much better than parking your money in the bank.3) Go for a risk adverse Investment- linked product in which ask consultants in detail about your concerns so that you understand the products much better and have a better insight to plan your future. This, of course comes with low risk. However, do keep in mind that low risk is not no risk. The advantage to this is that a professional trained fund manager helps to manage your funds and you reap the benefits at a short price.4) Lastly, if you are an existing AIA client, my company has released a new product that is a 3 year fixed deposit that gives you 3% interest per annum which I feel is one of the best interest rates in the market.If you have any other further questions or would like to know more, feel free to contact me at kzin_htoo@aia.com.sg.0 comments0"
