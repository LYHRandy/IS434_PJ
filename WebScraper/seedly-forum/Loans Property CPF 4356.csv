1,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Jan 2019I think it is a better ideal to pay through the bank loan. using CPF incurrs the accrual interest and you lose out on the int given by CPF. You can argue that CPF and the int is your own but it is better to pay just one set of interest(bank) 0 comments0"
2,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019There are more questions we will need first.1) How much loan are you taking? How confident are you able to service it pass 55?2) Are you looking at selling the condo or not? The accrued interest may be something you might want to take a look since this may affect your BRS and FRS (especially if your CPF SA is unable to hit FRS).3) Are you doing other investment which will give you returns better than 2.5%? If not, it's prudent to use cash to service.Do let us know more to help you. 2 comments0"
3,"Question Poster04 Jan 2019Thank you for your advice Tat Tian. My reply as follows:

1) appx $800k
2) yes we intend to sell the condo 6 to 10 years from now
3) mostly fixed deposit and equities
in addition, I am already using my monthly OA contribution to service the loan however the balance amount is abit tricky as to how much I should continue to use from my OA or the remaining should be purely cash to service. Loh Tat Tian04 Jan 2019Then in this case, you have to balance the opportunity cost of the money.

1) If you use CPF-OA, the the money would have gained 2.5% interest
2) If you used cash, the money would have gained XX% due to your investment. This is the critical issue. What sort of returns would you expect it to give? If it is going to be more than 2.5%, it will be wise to use CPF. If you are just putting in fixed deposit and not gaining much interest, then using cash to service would be good.
