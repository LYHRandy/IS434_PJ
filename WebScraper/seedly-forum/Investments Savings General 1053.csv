question,"Investments Savings General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 May 2019Why does no one talk about precious metals when it comes to financial literacy?I’ve started my journey in financial literacy last year. Still learning and very thankful for the contributors here on Seedly. Along the way, I found out about physical gold and silver commodities and was attracted to its safety and “undervalueness”. I’m surprised how little the number of people talk about PMs. I've now started my journey on stacking metals as a form of savings.

But storage is never easy. They hold value and adjust for inflation, but that's about it. You can't get rich from owning gold, silver, or platinum. You can stay rich by holding them instead. And usually in the anticipation of a recession and a weakening dollar, people can choose to hold PM instead as they are usually inversely correlated to USD and ride the wave.1 comment3"
