question,"Career General Asked by Angeline TeoAsked on 26 Apr 2019I have been finding people on LinkedIn that are working in the same field as I am. However,​ I had found it difficult to engage them on topics about work. How can I bridge this gap?Perhaps to put it more succinctly, I hope to find ""classmates"" or ""coursemates"" for the career I am working in. People whom I can talk to about work and how to go through difficulties regarding a particular work problem. To add on to that, I am also an introvert. It takes a lot out of me to even send an invite on LinkedIn. Any advice will be really helpful!3 answersAnswerBump0"

At your own workplace, start talking to your colleagues more and find out about industry events that they attend. Or ask them to introduce you to such people if they know of any.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 28 Apr 2019I think it would be better to join networking events if you want to connect with people in the same field. Try to go for conferences and say hello to people during coffee breaks or after conf drinks and follow up from there. There are also open communities that you can look for fellowships Another way would be to ask your colleagues to introduce you to people in the same field0 comments0"
