At the end of the day, a salary increment can be negotiated even without a postgraduate degree. But what can't be negotiated, are the skills you have to learn to survive in a world where information asymmetric plays against you. And whatever you've learnt belongs to you and up to you to package everything into your super power. ​We all go through the same and we are learning, constantly. ​Hope it clarifies some doubts you might be having.​Pascal​0 comments1"
2,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Apr 2018I agree that you'd need to have some work experience in the field/job you're pursuing your masters for. Simply because like a subject does not mean liking the environment the work requires you to be in; which comes to the question of whether the masters would be useful or not.​Apart from the pros and cons analysis (costs, time, relevancy and other factors);  if you are currently employed please don't expect your current employer to give you a increment based on your new qualification. They usually don't and if you are looking for salary adjustment it'd be in your next job during the negotiation stage.0 comments1"
3,"Jolie GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Apr 2018Hello!It highly depends on the sector you are in.  If you are considering postgraduate studies of a more general than technical nature, it is not uncommon employers will probably view you in the same way as other graduates. Having a Masters will then have little or no effect on your career options and starting salary. If you’re stuck in a situation where your existing qualification might be limiting you in your career, then getting a Masters could be a good idea. An example would be how Architecture students in local universities require at least a Masters in order to become a registered architect.It would be wise to evaluate getting a postgraduate degree in two aspects, mainly the costs of getting a Masters and potential benefits derived from it. (Assuming that the postgraduate studies are not sponsored.) The average costs of getting an M.Sc in Economics or Finance from NTU or SMU would range from around $34,500 to $39,400. If you decide to take a full-time Masters, you would also have to consider the loss of income which is averagely around $40,000 per annum for a BS/B.Sc for fresh graduates. To recoup the costs within the next 5 years, your starting salary would need to increase at least 30%, which as we mentioned earlier, may or may not happen depending on which sector you are in.Master ’s are helpful in making a drastic career change if it is difficult to do so on your own, without having to redo your bachelor’s degree. However, if you do not have any working experience in your chosen field, it would be highly recommended to work in the field for some time before deciding to take a Master’s in that selected field, just in case it may not be to your liking. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
