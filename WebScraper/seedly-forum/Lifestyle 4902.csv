1,"Mel Tan WmLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 27 Mar 2019It depends what resolution and what settings you want to play Overwatch on. I don't think Overwatch is a demanding title, unless you want to capture and livestream. For that, you would need a CPU with more threads to handle the multi-tasking.To get by, you can just deal with an Ryzen 5 2600 or an equivalent i5. Graphics, I would say a GTX 1050 or 1060 would suffice. Do check prices at shops at Sim Lim, and compare with online stores such as Newegg, Lazada, Amazon.Always do your homework first :)I got this build recently from Typhoon systems. You can check it out, serves me prety well for gaming and video editing :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7CrXURgv2Q0 comments2"

It wil be much more expensive than a ready made on since sellers have the advantage of bulk buy. If you have not much significant, heavy use for it, then just buy from the shop.2 comments2"
5,"Question Poster26 Nov 2018Any tips? like where is good to get parts, how much I should budget for it.. etc!Lok Yang Teng26 Nov 2018Don't really recommend getting a building from scratch since that's more risky, more expensive and more time consuming. If you're not urgent, you can wait for year end (christmas/new year) sales, usually there'll be huge discounts then probably less than 1k. The game requires min. intel i3 processor and 4GB RAM which many low-tier CPUs already meet the cut."
6,Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019you can try looking at Aftershock! it's a singapore company which helps people build PCs and laptops. I got my gaming laptop from there and I have been loving it! there's also warranty and very good customer service! Price wise it is not expensive and is very reasonable :)5 comments1
