2,See all 3 comments Jonathan Chia Guangrong23 Feb 2019Only bonus interest is applicable if the minimum threshold of 70k is not met. Bonus interest starts from 0.1% and steps up by 0.1% to max 1.2% if current lowest balance is higher than previous month's lowest balance. The base interest is actually 70% of 1 month moving SIBOR and not strictly 1% per se. Cap of 150k account size after which interest of 0.05% will be applicable Question Poster26 Feb 2019Noted. Thank you for your help! will open an account soon
