1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dimensional Fund Advisors are a fund house like Aberdeen, Blackrock, Vanguard, etc.They founded an evidence backed investment philosophy that has shown that there are factors (dimensions) that have returned above market returns.1) Small cap companies do better than large cap companies2) Value does better than growth3) Profitable companies does better than less profitable companiesUsing these 3 factors for their equity portfolios, they have created funds that will buy companies that fall into this list. One of their funds, the World Equity Fund, holds obver 10000 securities from 44 countries that passes their framework.Only when certain stocks no longer pass their framework or when stocks come into their framework, will they make a decision to buy or sell the units. So their funds almost work like index funds, it's just that index is created by them which is created from a theoretical or scientific look at it, and then the practical aspect is in the fund management.Now because there aren't any more guesses to be made, they can charge very low fees like index funds. But you have constant attention to the portfolios/funds they provide as they are looking at it every day.2 comments4"
2,"Question Poster09 May 2019I see. thanks for the detailed explanation. So to summarize
DFA - funds that will buy equities that fall into their dimensions
ETFS - tracks index fund that it is following. index fund determined by total market capitalization index ( S&P 500, STI ETF)

For  DFA , if equity that is bought fell out of the dimension is sold
for  ETF ,for e.g. S&P 500, is the top 500 cap weighted stock. any stock got overtaken will be replaced in the index 

Is this true?Hariz Arthur Maloy09 May 2019Yes correct."
