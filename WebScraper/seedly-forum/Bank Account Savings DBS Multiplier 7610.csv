ProdigyAnswered on 21 Jul 2018Are you able to meet the criteria for the higher interest in dbs Multiplier? https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/landing/dbs-multiplier/If you are already crediting your salary into any dbs account, using dbs posb card at least once a month and you have at least 3k to spare in dbs Multiplier (to avoid fall below fee), you should open dbs Multiplier Account. 0 comments0"

If you had assessed that DBS multiplier can yield better interests , then by all means go ahead. If you open DBS multiplier, in general i do recommend to close the account if there is not much use for it. Some examples are people whom have too many GIRO or arrangement on that account, sometimes it is ""better"" to leave it there a minimum sum for transactions or have some memories for that account.​For fuss-free bank account, do consider CIMB, they offer 1% fuss-free interests for the 1st 50k if i remembered correctly.​All the best.0 comments0"
