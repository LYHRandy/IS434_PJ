question,"SeedlyTV EP06 CPF Asked by Zen Rogue XuanAsked on 28 Jun 2019Why is CPF interest calculated in the current strange manner? CPF interest is calculated monthly, but credited and compounded annually in December. However, banks' interests are credited at the end of every month and compounded accordingly. This would mean that monies in the CPF accounts do not get to compound every month.3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 01 Jul 2019 revised answer My first guess is the related to either the database / processing speed, or system limitation.My second guess is maybe keeping interest calculations separate from the transaction balance would make it easier, in case parliament passes something like an incentive to some folks, and have it dated retrospectively, eg from the beginning of the year, even if it was say approved in parliament in april.Tested simulation using my own cpf OA 2015 transactions, and I got an answer that was only 59 cents lower than the interest shown (889.05 vs 889.64) on the 2015 statement. So I foundthe good news is the interest is compounded monthly.the bad news is the interest appears to be possibly calculated on the lowest balance figure of the month The calculation logic I used wasderive full year interest on beginning balancederive 11/12 annual interest on jan change to balancederive 10/12 annual interest on feb change to balance.... EtcSo hope this answers your question - there is monthly compounding.Also, going by this logic then there might be an unexpected impact between timing of transaction and the amount of interest earned in a year.3 comments1"
2,"See all 3 comments T@Takingstock @01 Jul 2019Come to think of some other blogs, by those past 65, they go cpf branch and ask how much interest they can withdraw. So its already calculated. Maybe in a separate table, thats not updated to the balances you see.

Do think the cpf tops (eg medisave top ups for merdaka) etc, maybe play a role, but prob not too big either.Zen Rogue Xuan01 Jul 2019Thank you takingstock for crunching the numbers:)"

You can even calculate it for yourself if you are game.Basically, they take the lowest balance of the month to calculate the monthly interest, compounded and only credit it at the end of the year.0 comments0"

Anyway it's up to the ""corporation"" to decide how much interest rate or frequency of payment.But just to clarify, not all banks. POSB Bank also works the same way. You will only get your interest at year end.And, not sure if you notice also, CPF interest is calculated based on the lowest amount in the month. So whenever possible, try to arrange any CPF deduction (e.g. lum sum house loan payment) after all of your incoming cpf monies (e.g. salary).1 comment0"
