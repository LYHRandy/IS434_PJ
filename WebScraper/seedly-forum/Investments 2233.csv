1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Not at all, because looking at share price as an absolute does not make sense in evaluating a company. Initial questions to ask:is the business growing? At what rate compared to it's competitors?do they grow consistently year on year, and are in line with management guidance?is the business in a growth industry? what is it's leadership position in the market it competes in?how are their financials, and how are margins trending?how healthy is their balance sheet and what is their cash conversion cycles like compared to peers?post looking at the above, look at valuation ratiosunderstand how their stock has moved, and how news have impacted them both positively and negatively Of course, the whole art and science of determining whether a company is a 'lousy' company is an entire industry by itself, which can't be summarized by merely a few questions ;)0 comments1"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Hello!a company with low share price does not mean that a company is lousy, there could be other reasons besides it steming from a deterioration in the business environment which the company is in, thereby resulting in poorer future prospects which could make the price low. Other reasons for the share price declining could arise from a gap between expectations and reality, or an overall pessimistic mood due to a persistent bear market and not because the company is lousy. Hope this helps!0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019No it doesn't! share price doesn't tell any story actually, it's the valuation ratios that you get from using the share price that allows you to compare the performance of the company against others in the same industry! Stock price x total outstanding shares = Market value of firmFrom the equation you see above, you can tell that if you have 2 companies of equal market value of lets say 1000 dollars, but firm A has 200 outstanding shares, but firm B has 100, firm As share price is 1000/200 = $5, but firm B is 1000/100 = $10! it just means how much does it cost for a piece of the firm's pie!However, we can get other ratios from stock price, such as the P/E ratio, which is the (price of the share)/(Earnings per share), which tells us how much people are willing to pay for $1 of earnings per share. Comparing the P/E ratio of a firm to it's industry average gleams alot of information about whether this valuation of $1 earnings per share by the firm is overvalued or undervalued, since the value of that earning as compared to its peers should be about the same!Of course, this is a very general explanation. More ratios are required to get a better idea of whether the firm is a good or bad investment, but either way, low share price =/= lousy! 0 comments0"
