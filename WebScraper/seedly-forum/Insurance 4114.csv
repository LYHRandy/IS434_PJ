MasterAnswered on 23 Aug 2018Hi,​Incomeshield is the older version of the Integrated Shield Plan or what we term as hospitalisation plans. It doesnt provide ""As Charged"" coverage but impose a limit on various medical treatments. In short, if nothing serious occurs, the limits should be able to cover most scenarios, but if something drastic or serious such as stroke, brain surgery etc, chances are that there would be out of pocket expenses.​I have some questions for you before i can provide further advice:1) Does your parents have the riders? (Assist Rider)2) Are your parents still healthy?3) When was the last time they sought treatment in a hospital?​You have a couple of options depending on the answers to my questions. 1) Upgrade to Enhanced Incomeshield + Rider (which will be subjected to medical underwriting and may suffer some exclusions)2) Opt for Aviva's moratorium underwriting (No medical underwriting required, premiums are  CPF-MA: $600, CASH: $635 + $1245 per annum for 100% private hospital coverage)​Pm me at brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg should you like to find out more!0 comments1"

However, there are different levels of incomeShield from the basic one to the one covering Class A wards.​You have to see which plan they are on and see how much they are covered first.0 comments1"
