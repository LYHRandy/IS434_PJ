1,"Izah AlepLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Based on your question,i suggest you to read more about index investing first to get a better understanding. Once you have a better understanding on how the stock market works then you can start investing. Else just keep on saving and treat that 5k as your emergency fund if you currently do not have one.4 comments2"

5,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Nov 2018Singapore Saving Bond would be more suitable for you. In the meantime, you should read up on etf. Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0"
6,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 18 Oct 2018I'll assume that when you mentioned about monthly returns, you meant monthly dividends. If you are comfortable with US market stocks, one counter comes to mind that will fit your criteria: Realty Income (Stock Counter: O). This counter pays dividends every month since 1995, and have been increasing dividend payouts for the last 20+ years or so, and will soon be added to the list of dividend aristocrat stocks (stocks that increase dividends every year for 25 years or more).From your question, it may seem that you are pretty new to investing. Do read up more first before starting on your investment journey, and do set aside emergency funds beforehand as well. All the best.0 comments0"

8,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Oct 2018Can consider Singapore Savings Bond, STI ETF via POSB InvestSaver, US ETFs via Robo-advisors (Stashaway/AutoWealth/Smartly), P2P lending etc. As for which to invest in, it all depends on your risk appetite. But as always, all investments come with risk so invest with money that you can afford to lose and read up before investing, don't invest/follow others blindly. Here's an article from Seedly on the various investment products that you can consider - https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-easiest-ways-to-invest-a-monthly-sum-for-beginners/0 comments0"
9,Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Singapore savings bonds. $5k is too little and precious for you to risk on shares or on anything else that doesn't guarantee returns.2 comments0
10,"Pat16 Oct 2018what is the minimum which you would recommend to risk on shares?Elsa Goh16 Oct 2018It's not just about the amount that should be risked on shares - it is about how much is available for investment. $5k is frankly not a lot and should be treasured and not risked on shares. To be able to get meaningful returns on shares i would say at least $8k, and only if you are confident you will not need that sum for the next 6 months minimum AND it should not be your emergency funds. Reason is that investing in shares carries a risk of losing almost all your capital. E.g. hyflux."
