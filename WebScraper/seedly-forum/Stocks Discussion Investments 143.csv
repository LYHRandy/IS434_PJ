1,"Gavin TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Just broke its previous 52week high so, be careful if you wanna get into this REIT now.My recommendation would be to wait it out, maybe for a correction of sorts, then get in.The REIT is not a must buy but, it doesn't mean it 's a bad REIT, so it all comes down to if you like the business model of the REIT.Personally I bought it at its 52week high previously and I'm pretty relieved that it's at 1.26 now!!0 comments1"
