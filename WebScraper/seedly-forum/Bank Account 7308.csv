question,Bank Account Asked by Shaun Wq LimAsked on 02 Sep 2019Is there no way to update the account credentials without losing previous transactions in Seedly? Or can we export the previous transactions out and reimport again?Changing of banking credentials is a requirement by the bank because of the changes to the personal data protection law. I am losing almost a year of transactions if I reconfigure my accounts. That is not acceptable.1 answerAnswerBump1

1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 03 Sep 2019Hey Shaun! As a fix to this issue:Under the 'Accounts' tab, click on your Account or Credit Card.Click the 'Settings' button at the top right-hand corner.Select 'Delete' at the bottom to delete your account/credit card.Thereafter, choose to 'Keep Transactions'.Add your OCBC account (with your new credentials) to sync. This will allow you to refresh your connection with the new credentials, however do note that duplicate transactions may arise from this. Thereafter, you have to manually delete/ignore the duplicate transactions. :)2 comments0"
