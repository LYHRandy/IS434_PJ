1,"Darren ChewLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Jul 2019Ascendas Reit is Singapore’s first and largest listed business space and industrial Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) with a portfolio diversified across five major segments of the business space and industrial property market.It has 171 properties span across Singapore, Australia and UK which constitute 70%, 14% and 7% by value of the properties respectively.With FED expecting to cut interest rate in July and MAS is considering raising the REITs current leverage limit of 45% to 50%. This have make S-REITs outperform the market and Asendas REITs is approaching it history high price.However, do take note that Ascendas paid dividend semi annually unlike most  of the other reits that pay dividend quarterly.I had just sold Ascendas at 3.19 today for a capital gain of 22% as i feel that their price is moving up too fast into an overbought region. Shall buy back this REITs when there is a market correction which i hope that it will happen in the near term.This is just my view and disclaimer applies.0 comments1"
