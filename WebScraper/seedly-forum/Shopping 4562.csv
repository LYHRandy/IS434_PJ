On top of that, you can earn $4 Cashback by making reservation via ShopBack. 1.) Visit www.shopback.sg or Launch ShopBack App first (Sign Up/ Log In to your SB account)2.) Search for Quandoo3.) You will be redirected to Quandoo's web! Make reservation as usual.
So you can save $ while eating out; sometimes eat practically for free (when you collect a lot of points)0 comments3"
