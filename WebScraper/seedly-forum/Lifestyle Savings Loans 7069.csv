1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 4w agoHello, it will definitely be better to save up your emergency funds first. The idea of an emergency fund is that you only use it in event of dire circumstances and that it should cover at least 6-12 months of expenses at least. In your case, I am not sure what your savings are right now but look at building up the emergency fund first.You are right that loans can be helpful in certain cases, as it will allow you to afford items that you normally would not be able to otherwise. E.g. housing loan, education loan. As we borrow money to fund a house or our education, we expect that our investment into a house or our education will reap returns greater than the interest rate of our loan. In such a case, a loan is useful.As a side note, I would look at your insurance expenditure. If you are in your early-mid 20s, it seems rather high for your age group, especially if you are only covering critical illness and hospitalization. While we need insurance, affordability is also another factor that we need to look into. As I don't have the specifics of your situation, I can't provide any further advice apart from general advice at this point, if you are open to sharing a little more with me so that I can give you more detailed advice, feel free to reach out to me.3 comments6"
2,"See all 3 comments Elijah Lee3w agoHi there, if you have $6K in your emergency fund, it should be sufficient in a pinch. Now, in the case of your education funding, education loans have a relatively low interest rate (but of course can't be compared to mortgage, for example) so if your return on investment (the knowledge gained from your education, your increase in salary due to better qualifications, etc) will be justified, then by all means, I would encourage you to upgrade yourself.Elijah Lee3w agoFor your insurance, an endowment plan is not actually for insurance, but more of a disciplined savings. It has almost negligible coverage compared to Whole Life or term. What you need to look out for is your hospitalization , and critical illness when you commence working full time. I suppose your endowment would have been running for a while already, and if you were to terminate it, you would definitely incur a loss."

Use it, replenish it again later :)That's the point of an emergency fund, right?Your ability to take a loan now is probably limited, plus unsecured loan is going to be expensive for you.0 comments0"
4,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 4w agoI'm reading this question as ""should I take a loan to invest?""Personally, I won't recommend it; as it investments itself has a certain risk, you will be doubling the risk by taking a loan for investments. Leveraging should only be done if you know what you are doing, and the risks involved. It will also be good if you have a bale-out plan (i.e. extra funds), just in case your leveraging fails.Since you are on internship (which wouldn't last forever), I would suggest that you take this time to 1. organise your budget, 2. learn how to cut your budget to the bare minimum, and 3. read up more on investments. You can start after you sort yourself out and start after your internship. 1 & 2 would be really helpful when you start to get a proper salary, as your expense will be kept at $1200, the rest of it all will be for savings & investments (maybe a little extra for parents).1 comment0"
5,"Question Poster3w agoOh no, sorry I didn't really make it clear in my question. Was hoping to figure out if it's a good idea to take a loan to cover my education. Also understand that I'll be super risk-averse now because of my situation. 

But I agree, I'll definitely have to adjust my lifestyle to adapt to this budget. Thanks for sharing the tips, will keep them in mind!"
