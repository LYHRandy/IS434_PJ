This way, they won't get taxed for their dividends, and they will also be able to buy more shares.3 comments1"

So, for example, they declare 1 dollar dividend per share, you will get 70 cents in dividend due to withholding.Personally, it doesn't make sense to sell the stock before the stock record date so as not to be hit by withholding tax. You will have to do it 4 times a year for 8 transactions in total (4 X buy/sell) as dividends are given quarterly. Not only this but you won't be entitled to the dividend as well. Don't think people will do as what you described, sorry to say.0 comments0"
