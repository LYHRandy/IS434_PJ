There are several reviews already available online:Moneysmart:  https://blog.moneysmart.sg/invest/dbs-digiportfolio-robo-advisor/ Investmentmoat: https://investmentmoats.com/money/dbs-etf-digiportfolio/
Things to take note of: DBS Digiportfolio will still have some elements of active management through their managers (every quarter).The global portfolio (the one I am assuming you are interested in) invest in UK Listed ETFs, allowing tax savings.Its fees, at 0.75% is rather competitive in the robo advisor space.The investment is done in USD, so be aware of currency risk!0 comments0"
