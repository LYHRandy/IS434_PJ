1,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Oct 2018Sorry to hear that. Consider getting the flat ownership transferred to you and one parent, or to just one parent - hdb may allow. But u will need to sort out who will continue servicing the loan and expenses, and what needs to be refunded to cpf.0 comments2"

Unfortunately, a quick look at HDB's rental scheme criteria shows that you will need to include another Singapore citizen or PR in the basic family nucleus in order to rent directly from HDB. More information can be found here https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/renting-a-flat/renting-from-hdb/public-rental-schemeI'm afraid the only other option is to rent from the open market if you wanna live on your own, but this typically involves a few hundred dollars commitment a month. As an alternative to living on your own, do you have other close relatives who you can stay with? This may be a better idea than living on your own0 comments0"
