1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Mar 2019Selling call options naked would not be a good idea, as essentially you will be shorting the underlying stock. If price surges and continues to surge you are looking at unlimited losses.You should consider selling call options only if you are holding on to the stock in lot sizes of 100, since each option contract controls 100 shares. Good way to earn additional income other than via dividends.If you don't hold the stock, consider sell put credit spreads instead (bull put spreads). More likely for position to expire worthless, higher roi of 30%+ onwards and position can be repaired for profit if in trouble (this is unique to my community only though). Hope this helps0 comments0"
