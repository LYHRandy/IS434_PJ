question,"Investments Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Jul 2019If you have $30,000 now, and plan to save/invest $1000 more every month, how would you diversify your investments and savings? I have some plan on it, but want to know what everyone thinks!?I plan to put $20k in savings account (multiplier), and transfer $10k to SSB when better rates come out, $5k into S&P 500, and another $5k into stocks and P2P lending platforms (just a small amount). Most of what I save month-on-month will be put into the savings account or the ETF.6 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 13 Jul 2019I'd skip the SSB and go straight to a globally diversified portfolio of funds based on my risk profile and investment horizon. DCA, rebalance yearly, and adjust my asset allocation every 5 years.
I'd also skip the P2P lending platforms and invest in Asian Corporate High Yield Bonds instead for exposure into that asset class.0 comments2"

Usually when I advice my other casual friends, I would exactly do as what you mentioned above. Go learn the market, and experience the stocks and ETFs yourself. My turning point was when I lost some money doing simple traditional investments, so I made a decisions to learn more like what Hariz and Jefremy is doing now. Once you are more educated of the financial market, feel free to invest into non traditional ways.1 comment1"

4,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 17 Jul 2019Note: Since this is a conditional question, I'll answer it conditional mannerI consider myself a highest risk profile person, and savvy in investments but the only savings I have is this $30k in my bank account and extra $1k that I'll set aside every month from now on until I retire. I spend $2k every month, single but attached, planning to get married next year and my wife to be and myself love children. We're planning to have 3.Because I have short term goals coming up (getting married and planning to have children), the $30k I'll leave it in my UOB One Account. Also I spend $500 monthly on credit cards, so UOB One is a perfect fit, no need to stretch my spending to earn the interest. $30k isn't enough to get married and have kids, so the balance $1k I have every month I'll put half of it back into my UOB One account. Because I already have my insurance in place, I do not need to worry about losing this money in the event I get into an accident or fall sick seriously. Being high risk doesn't mean you should take unnecessary risks. Since I'm of the highest risk profile, savvy in investments and enjoy trading, the balance of money I'll split 80% into FOREX and 20% into a decent insurance savings plan. This is because I still want to outsource the risk of investing and have some guarantees on my wealth building plans. Being high risk doesn't mean you have to be foolish.Gains that I take from FOREX will be channelled into long term value investing in shares on an annual basis. This is to lock up my profits from FOREX and generate some side income as I leave money in shares to work for me. Being high risk now doesn't mean you'll stay so forever. We'll all grow old and want to have guarantees on our wealth the older we become.0 comments0"
5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Jul 2019If it were up to me, I'll put aside the 6 months' worth of emergency savings first. Rest I'll pump into overseas brokerage and repeatedly chug out sell to open option positions on stocks for 60%pa. Risk is there but can be managed if you know how. Constantly add to account every month. I will not consider S&P500 now as it is at an all time high. May not be able to go much higher for now. I'll skip the p2p as well as there is a risk of default and the returns simply do not interest me.0 comments0"
6,"Darryl SnowLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 16 Jul 2019Sounds like an extremely conservative plan - not a bad thing when the markets are running on fumes as they are, or if you are approaching retirement age. Personally I wouldn't put 2/3 in a savings account or SSB - I would rather have the money actually working for me than wasting away, barely keeping ahead of inflation. P2P lending is on the other end of the scale - I consider my risk apetite to be high, but I wouldn't touch those even to balance out a conservative portfolio.An S&P500 ETF is a great plan, especially with a minimum $5k up front to minimize the impact of fees, but I'm feeling a consensus that we're in for some volatility over the coming months or years, so you'd have to be prepared to stomach that.I would put more into stocks, specifically dividend-paying stocks, and also bonds given your conservative profile. Monthly averaging in to the ETF sounds like a good plan (again, I would skip the savings account) but at $1000/month you're going to be paying a higher % in fees (still only around $5/month) to buy in, but that would be the case whether you're averaging into the ETF or into stocks/bonds. I guess it depends on how active you want to be - if you don't want to put in the time to research stocks and bonds before buying then the ETF is a good long-term, globally diversified option.You perhaps shouldn't limit yourself to one ETF though - the S&P500 is the sexy one that everyone knows about but there are plenty of other promising funds to explore. Bear in mind that dividends paid out by US companies are subject to a 30% dividend witholding tax (DWT), which means you may not reap as high rewards as a US investor on the same fund. If your heart is set on S&P500 then look for Irish-domiciled funds like iShares Core S&P 500 to reduce the tax to 15%, or otherwise look to funds in Singapore and Hong Kong (0% DWT), UK (10% DWT), Australia/Japan/Europe (15%). Try and get the most bang for your buck given that you'll be paying relatively higher fees for the smaller investments.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 13 Jul 2019What 30k in cash would afford meA USD$6000 Asset that pays out 6% p.a. with capital appreciation potential of 5x.10 Canadian gold maples worth $20k$1,000 monthly invested in gold savings account till my dollar total is 40k.
Till then learn how to earn 20% p.a. 
With my 60k saved, 15k invested in crowdfunding earning 10% p.a. 15k in gold, the other half earning 20% p.a.
I'd have 4 years to learn to do so. With Financial markets in a downturn, I am forced to look beyond the traditional bonds, stocks, reits, treasury notes, derivatives. 
At the end of year 10, i would have a cash flow of 3.3k p.a., 80k in safe assets, 44k in investment gains from 30k capital. *assuming gold doesn't appreciate vs dollarIn my opinion0 comments0"
