1,"Yeap Ming FengLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Sep 2018Took a pay cut from Bloomberg to be an intern at a Fintech Company too! It was all worth it!​In my opinion, you taking up of job should depend on a few things:Can you learn something and be a better person from your colleagues and bosses?Do you believe in the value and direction of the company?Make a decision from there, assuming for a start, one does not need much to survive having just got out of university. If you are ok with it, why not try something new and get some experience, provided it is a great company to be in. ​After your first internship or job, I guess the results for your university degree should matter less in your future interviews as employers will be more interested in your experiences, skills and knowledge. 0 comments4"

WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Hi If you can learn something good related to blockchain / fintech applications like the dev or structure or how to ops related, then take it up the 1k internship for the time being. As long as you see them willing to teach you (ask them about what you will be ask to do and who will be your mentor etc). If there's something good related to blockchain and fintech applications, then learn as much and as fast as you can, apply and research about it, bear with the 1k for the time being about 8 months to 1 year (depends on how much /fast you can learn/ apply).  ​After this, you can demand much better / higher pay than 3k rather, so that should make up for it and also gives you a better head start than others who are not in the field or without related experience. ​0 comments2"

God of WisdomAnswered on 11 Sep 2018My first job out of uni, was a mentee copywriter position in a local startup. My pay was 1.3k with a monthly increase if I performed well.I ended the year with a 2k salary, but it was the best decision I could have possibly made in my career.And its because of who your bosses and colleagues are. If they're competent, you'll learn a lot.If they're not, you'll be wasting your time.So make sure, the people you'll be joining know their stuff and can impart marketable skills that can help you earn more or start a business on your own in the next 3 to 5 years. 0 comments2"

5,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018It really depends on what you want to achieve at the end of the day. If you could work in a reputable company with good boss or mentor while learning the rope, then I would say it is worth it. 0 comments1"

(otherwise you are total desprate here)​Make a quick check on where the pay can cover your basic expenses (enough so that you aren't sleeping in cardboard boxes and starving) If it can't even cover the basic, and you're really interested, you can try negiotiate an amount to cover the basics, would help if you can provide a reasonable list of basic expenses (no luxuries)​Ask if the internship (assume 1 year) will lead to permanent job, if there are no accidents. (if this is your dream company & job). Otherwise, consider if working at this company for 1 year will boost your resume.​Personally, if the company is worth it, I think you should go for it. (Unless you really can't afford it) Interns are usually paid peanuts. Don't accept for sake of accepting a job, unless you're really desprate, then try to delay them as much as possible while trying to see if you can get a better offer elsewhere. (not sure about other fintech but for some fields usally as long as you graduate is enough, they dont look at grade, at most honours, dinstinction)0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Dear Friend,​Fintech is a term butdoes it really improve your skill sets in the Finance Sector?are u just doing sales or Finance research?will you be tight down by a bond of 1 year or 2 year?​If the job scope increase your skill sets, i said go for it even when the salary is low.​If is a day job that does not allows you to improve, and if you have any loan or debt to repay, is better to focus on a job that pays you better and clear the loan asap.​Also, the earlier you have good cpf income, it also helps you in reaching your FRS in the future.​Hope my reply helps.​If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.​https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xi​Thank you.0 comments0"

9,"Huang YixuanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 28 Sep 2018I think it's perfectly fine to take up an internship after graduation, it can push you closer to your career goals if tech is an area you want to pursue. Before I started working at Seedly I was helping my friend at his tech start up too, and if it weren't for that experience, I would not have ventured into the start up scene or found Seedly :)​0 comments0"
