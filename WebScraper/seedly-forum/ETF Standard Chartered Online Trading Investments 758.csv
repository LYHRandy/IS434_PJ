question,ETF Standard Chartered Online Trading Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 25 Jun 2019What are the associated fees when purchasing IWDA ETF (or overseas ETF) on SCB trading?I am looking to purchase IWDA ETF on SCB trading. Looking to purchase fixed sum every quarter. Could somebody advise on what would be the expected transaction fees? Would it be USD 10 excluding the exchange rate loss? I remembered seeing a fee that was greater than USD 10 when i tried purchasing awhile back but never got down to asking/finding out. Would appreciate advise here :) Thanks1 answerAnswerBump0
