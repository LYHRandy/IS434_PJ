God of WisdomUpdated on 21 Sep 2019Hello, no, unfortunately, there aren't any, but what you can do is to either layer 6 SSBs one month apart, or buy different shares/REITs that pay in different months so that you can achieve the same effect. Having said that, REITs and stocks don't have fixed payout dates either, so it might not be the best option.Depending on your capital, 6 SSBs might be a cheaper and safer option for this purpose, as you only need to put in a token amount to achieve the payouts. The application cost of the SSBs will be more than offset by the additional interest from the fulfilment of the bonus category.1 comment5"
