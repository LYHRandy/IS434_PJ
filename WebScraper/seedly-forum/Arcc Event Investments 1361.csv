Grand MasterAnswered on 12 May 2019The entry and exit of a position depends on your own desired outcome. Every individual will have their own investment strategy that differs from others. Always stick to your investment strategy and review your portfolio regularly and allocate your invested asset accordingly. (Asset Allocation within the 6 the major asset class is crucial)There are times when I exit a position to move into another fund so that I am able to hedge against the volatility of the market as that is in line to my portfolio strategy. I tend to hold more in cash when I am uncertain of market as a hedge and wait for opportunity to go in. (But I am subjecting myself to reinvestment risk when I do that too)Ultimately it is important to stay invested and not time the market. As the saying goes itâ€™s not about timing the market but your time in the market.Lastly always DYOR or seek professional advice when unsure.0 comments2"
