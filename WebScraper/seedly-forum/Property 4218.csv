God of WisdomAnswered on 15 Sep 2019Try to ensure that you maintain the first $20000 in your OA, as the extra 1% interest will be credited to your SA to help fund your retirement. Don't sacrifice your retirement just to own a bigger flat.In a pinch, having $20000 buffer in OA will help you to pay the loan should you go through a period of unemployment.0 comments6"
2,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated 4w agoKeep $20,000 in our CPF OA becausethe 1st $20,000 earns an extra 1% interest so you are getting 3.5% for OA. Not bad.a buffer of $20,000 allows you to cater for emergency payment if you suddenly get retrenched / unemployedThis buffer can help in accommodating for higher interest rate from the bank that is higher than your monthly contribution from work (I encountered this last year)Seedly has a good article on this CPF hack- https://blog.seedly.sg/cpf-hacks-tips-for-singaporeans/0 comments2"

I wrote about this recently also: https://blog.seedly.sg/cpf-hacks-tips-for-singaporeans/It was introduced in 2018, and personally, I also did this because I would want the flexibility to also have that extra reserve just in case I got retrenched or out of a job and I still would have to service my CPF mortgage.This new rule is fantastic because:Your first $20k in your Ordinary Account earns an additional 1% interest which makes it 3.5%. That’s a guaranteed $700 in a year.It gives you flexibility (as described above for most couples who bought their first property)0 comments0"
5,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated 4w agoNo. It's prudent to keep an amount (20k for current rules) as it helps you to plan finances and tides you over unemployed period, so you can focus on getting a job.The interest in CPF is 2.5%, which is really only prudent to pay off if the interest for your bank loan is hitting 2.7% or higher (which in this case, just paying off might be a better choice, which you also need to take into account the refinance and other fees).EDIT: I saw many posting on that extra 1% interest. Its only applicable if you have less than 60k CPF combined (including OA). Once you have 60k in SA and MA, it doesn't matter how much you have in your OA. Hence i said just to keep enough to pay for 1 to 2 years mortgage.0 comments0"
