1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Autowealth rebalance to maintain the portfolio allocations. If your allocation is 80stocks/20bonds, and 1 side becomes overweight due to market movements, then it will rebalance back to 80/20. All is done automatically so you dont need to do it.For referral, here is the current promotion: https://www.autowealth.sg/promotions/referral.php You have to enter fullname before submission: THAM YONG ZHI GABRIEL4 comments1"

No, there is no app currentlyTai Zhi24 May 2019Hi John, statistically we rebalance 5-6 times in a year on average. That said, we rebalanced a lot more in 2018 and 2019 till date as a result of the excessive market volatility. This also mean clients can enjoy higher extra returns as we sell (take profit on) portfolio assets that performed well and buy portfolio assets that haven't performed that well at discounted prices."
