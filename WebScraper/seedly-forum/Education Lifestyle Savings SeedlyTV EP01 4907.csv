1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Mar 2019I did this to avoid taking on a loan. It's simple but hard work if you are starting with no financial support. Here's what I did:Get an internship that pays and allows flexible hours. Give private tuition in the evenings and weekends.Save on your spending. With all the time you are spending working, giving tuition and studying, it is not likely that you have time for recreational activities. That was in a nutshell my life throughout my uni years. I would study from 12am to 3am for exams, sleep, then wake up to get to 830am class the next morning, and do my internship job remotely between lectures, then give private tuition from 7-10pm. Then I would have dinner, head home, and start studying again to 3am. Thankfully it paid off - I got enough to cover my tuition fees, my living expenses and also with some savings left over!0 comments1"
