1,"Tee-Ming ChewLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Jun 2018I personally have gone through the same situation as you (eventually graduated from Computer Science in NUS) and here's my thoughts:​You should continue study in university ifYou need a backup plan in case a degree certificate matters (especially for some of the big companies)You feel that you're not ready for a career in tech with your current knowledgeYou don't know specific what job in tech that you want to pursueYou can start a career in tech immediately (and not study in university) ifYou feel that you are well equiped with the knowledge in techYou know specifically what you want to do in tech (full-stack, frontend, backend, data, etc)You are confident that you can secure a job that you likeTo sum up, I think the main deciding factor is whether you need the degree certification as a backup plan. I personally know many great developers who do not possess any degree in Computer Science and are working in great companies (they are passionated in tech and worked extremely hard).​Hope that helps!0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 23 Sep 2018I suggest: ​Work for a few years, get some good understanding of the actual work, pros and cons, what do you like to do or not like to do etc. ​With that experience in mind, you will be able to decide better what suits you in the degree choices, and directions that you wish to go. ​This is like , if you never try the food , how do you know it is nice or not nice  by just looking at the menu or picture. Even if is recommended by food blogger, it is still your own personal preferences that matters to you. If you had tried the food, you then can decide to order more, and if to continue to come to this place to eat. This way you will save much more time, effort and a great deal of pain.​Apply Lean Principle (or read ""The lead startup"") and you will be able help decides life's matter better :) 0 comments0"
