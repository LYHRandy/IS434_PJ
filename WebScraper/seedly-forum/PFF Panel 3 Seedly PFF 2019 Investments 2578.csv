1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hi anon, as explained by Sandra, it is possible to improve returns while possibly reducing risk via diversification. This is according a theory known as Markowitz Portfolio theory, which basically says that if 2 stocks (or more) are no perfectly correlated a mixture of the two (or more) will produce a line that represents the most efficient returns for that particular level of risk (in terms of standard deviation). The lower the correlation, the better the ability to diversify away diversifiable or firm specific risk, as the ups and downs on Stock A is increasinglyy offset by Stock B the lower (and negative) the correlation to the movement in price of Stock A. Volatility in your returns decrease, and the point which gives you the least volatility is known as the Minimum Variance Portfolio on the Markowitz curve. Essentially, it explains how diversification leads to lower risks!I think Investopedia explains this much more in detail, and I suggest you look up this theory up there!0 comments0"
2,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hi there! You can diversify your portfolio to improve your expected returns and reduce overall portfolio risk. To reduce risk, find asset classes that have different correlations with one another. Commodities is a good option to add into your portfolio as it historically has a low correlation to stock and thus can complement your portfolio, reducing risk and increasing expected returns.0 comments0"
