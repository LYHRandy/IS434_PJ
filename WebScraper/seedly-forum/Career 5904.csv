WizardUpdated on 21 Nov 2018Doing full accounts means you'll need Degree in Accouting or CPA or ACCA which takes times / $ and may not pass at 1 go.Instead of Accounting, shoul focus on IT accounting software consultancy etc since you have the background.Fastest way ? Advertise yourself for freelance services or even community services for charitable organizations in helping the company when they try to buy new accounting software / migrated existing accounts. Gaining experience and add on to your portfolio is fastest way to gain grounds on Accounting / IT.Note: The future is on FinTech (IT + Finance + Accounts), do join startup networking events, FinTech talks / conference to find out more and talk to the people to get more opportunities by networking!0 comments2"
