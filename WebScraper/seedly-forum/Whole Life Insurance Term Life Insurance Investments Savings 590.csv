1,"Jacqueline YanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 05 Sep 2019I was in a similar situation previously too!Unfortunately, my reason to consider giving up my savings plan was not to invest on my own, but more because I needed to replan my finances to fund my part-time studies.When I bought the plans, I was (still am) considered low-risk sort of person, and that was probably why I felt that those plans were attractive. But I was setting aside $500/mth for those savings plans, on top of my regular savings and that was a little too much for me to handle.It was a painful process, but in the end, I decided to surrender two of them. That cost me slightly more than $2k since I've been holding them for 1-2 years.I kept the first one though (4 years in), partially because I couldn't bear to lose that much anymore and I could still keep up with the premiums.This may not be as helpful as the rest since I'm also super new at this. But I feel it'll be helpful to evaluate if you're able to keep up with the savings premiums on top of your own investments? Also, if you're new to investments like me, do you have the time to manage your portfolio such that you'll get better returns?1 comment3"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 05 Sep 2019Look back at why you took up those plans in the first place? Are the reasons still valid? For the life plan if it is given up will there be a gap in your protection needs? Likewise for your endowment plans, do you think you can generate better returns on your own? Personally, I did give up my endowment which was coincidentally with prudential as well after 13+ years as I could generate much better returns (more than 10x what Pru can offer) on my own in more recent years. Hence it's a no brainer for me to give it up. Not sure about your situation. But do think hard as there are costs involved in giving up.Hope this helps2 comments2"

I’m thinking of switching to a term plan (either with or without early CI). And for my endowment plans, I’m not 100% confident on generating better results on my own, but there’s potential for better returns if I’m investing in other areas as compared to the 25 year plan.Jonathan Chia Guangrong05 Sep 2019If you switch to term, can it last until an age where there are no longer any financial obligations on your part? If there's any change in your health status after you got your whole life plan do think twice before switching. If you want to invest do know what you are doing. Have a goal in mind, know your risk profile then find out what are the suitable instruments. Or just consider robo advisories like stashaway since they can have different portfolios for different risk profiles."
5,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 05 Sep 2019I’m in the same situation as you... just that mine is an ILP instead of a life insurance.Few things to consider,did your health condition change since you bought them? For my case, my ILP is the only one with no loading or exclusions which makes me hesitate about changing to a term plan. It’s still good to have a plan that protects you till 60-65? So a term plan is cheaper and good?as for saving plans, I’m also looking at the losses I’m going to deal with if I were to cancel them and do my own investments. Work out the sums, like are you able to get back the losses or even profit more in a longer run if you do your own investments? Maybe it’s good to talk to your financial Consultants or agents again about it? That’s what I’m gonna do soon.1 comment1"
6,"Question Poster05 Sep 2019Ah looks like there are many people in the same situation! For me, my health condition hasn’t changed since I bought the life plan. Thus I’m considering the cheaper switch. 

And yes, I’ll talk to my agents again about it! Hope you can find a good solution for your problem too."
