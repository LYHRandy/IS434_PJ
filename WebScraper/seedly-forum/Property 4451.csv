1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I do not think they will be of the same price. Sale of balance flats, u are buying from HDB. Resale u are buying from another person, which will be priced at the market (thus will be higher)2 comments0"
2,"Leong Wen Fong14 Nov 2018Actually, why are re-sale flats higher? I mean I get the thing about market rate, but technically their ""lease"" is shorter right? Shouldn't that mean that they have less value?Yixiong Chang14 Nov 2018Practically, time value has little effect on price in the initial couple of decades. One usually buy resale flats which are usually in more mature estates. The location itself will also command a higher premium.
