1,"Grace Lim Yan ZhenLevel 2. RookieAnswered 4w agoFirst thing first is get yourself educated like learn first. For example, some people save 500 dollars want to invest money, I think that is foolish because 500 dollars even they make like 10% if they don't have the right education or the right way then they will end up wasting 500 dollars because they are eager to invest. So instead of investing, they should invest in education. Because education gives us leverage, should not immediately push the stone but build the leverage so the 500 dollars can use it in educating yourself, learn what is investing and trading about. Spend the whole 500 dollars to learn. A lot of people, once they have the money they will start to invest in REITs, trading and all these things which end up losing all the money. Instead, you should invest in yourself first. Focus on investing in yourself and get yourself leverage first.0 comments2"
2,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated 4w agoHonestly, the ""best"" lessons usually involve losing money. When you ""lose"" money, the pain burns you and becomes something you will probably remember for life.As much as others may give you advice, or you gain so from reading, it is very easy to forget or rub off, because you may not have a painful memory of it.Think of it as learning cycling. Did you ever fall when you learnt cycling? The later you learn why you might fall (eg speeding), the more painful it could be then. Or think of mahjong. You learnt from being the one to throw the winning tile and losing money, how to see what other people are building, and how to judge what NOT to throw. You learnt from not winning very often, that you form assessments of your optimal strategy from your starting hand, and how to play to maximize winning chance.I like to recommend beginners limit themselves perhaps up to 2 month salary first while they are learning, so that if they made bad mistakes, it doesn't hurt bad. Even experienced folks can fall prey to greed / fear etc, so doesn't mean the more ""learned"" you are that you don't make mistakes (though you probably make less often).Take the time in the investing process to learn about yourself (filling out that risk assessment sheet most often ends up like doing a quiz, it might tell you how you behave, but a lot of times, people lie to themselves, so that ""info"" might not actually apply to you). You will find out your true self when you start encountering losses, feelings of fear or greed. Actually this part is very true... Many advisors look at the client and say you so young, you can afford to take high risk, or you think that you are pretty open to the wild rides of high risk instruments... Until you start losing money and figure out you may actually like safer / less volatile stuff.It is from finding out the worst flaws of yourself, that you will probably find the things that work for you. Eg I find that I can be very edgy and distracted when I do ""trading"", ie hope to buy low sell high, but from there, I eventually found my preference is dividend investing and focusing on growing the amount of dividends I collect each year. It is slow, but I learnt patience, and I often sleep better at night.It is from buying some endowments and learning how to calculate the returns and more importantly opportunity costs, I figured out yes I want to save money, but endowments locking me down for a long period wasn't what I wanted or needed. And I eventually found the alternative that suit my needs.It is from losing money in an ILP, that I learnt my own dividend portfolio is doing at least 3% better per year than the fund manager of my ILP funds. From then on, I also learnt high fees doesn't mean the manager knows what he is doing.2 comments1"
3,"T@Takingstock @3w agoNow... For the real tips:

1) Just like playing any game, the most important factor is always do your best NOT to lose.

2) If you don't know how to pick good stocks, go with an index fund with low cost (best below 1%). Lower costs erode less returns.

3) Time in market and compounding dividends and returns are key.
... (more)T@Takingstock @3w ago2nd set of tips:

5) A company must first be repeatedly profitable to pay you dividends. See Uber, Weworks.

6) No dividends doesn't mean the cash in balance sheet is real. Most often its not.

7) ""Go Big or Go Home"" usually means fold your hand and go home."

5,"Gavin TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 3w agoI entered @ May 2019, markets were at their highs and I didn't know. Fast forward, the next 4 weeks, all I can see are red upon red. Paper loss of 10% even, but I kept my stocks as I already did my research and plan to hold for the long term, now I'm already up 10+% including dividends!!Important things to note :What is your plan? For me, it would be dividend growth investing.How long are you planning to hold your positions?Remove all emotion and try to stay as objective as possible, meaning ignore all the market noise and volatility, and just focus on the important things, like every quarter's report, is the company profiting or not.Cheers and good luck in your investing journey!!0 comments0"
6,"Allan LeeLevel 2. RookieAnswered 3w agoBuying a stock is equivalent to buying a piece of the company. I would recommend reading the annual report of the company. Know how they make their monies. What’s their core business, what other businesses do they own?Look their competitors, as it has a direct impact on market share which affects revenue. Think with a horizon of 3-5 years, where do you see the company to be at?Example:
Alibaba core business is ecommerce: Taobao, TMall, Alibaba, AliExpress, Lazada etc. Their main competitor in China is JD.com second largest in China with 17% market share. Their other business segment also includes cloud computing, Digital & Media (Alibaba Pictures, Youku.)They also own food delivery company ele.me which competes with meituan. ￼A stake in Ant Financial which owns a payment processor Alipay vs Tencent’s wechat.And the list goes on and on. Lastly, the most important part is the valuation. How much are you willing to pay for its earnings (P/E Ratio)? How much does it cost to purchase a dollar of their assets (P/B Ratio)? Value from Discount Cash Flow analysis? If you are into dividend stocks also check out the payout ratio and how the company is doing, understand if the payout is sustainable. Do not just look at the yield. An example would be StarHub. Disclaimer: I’m not an expert in stock or financial advisor. Just some guy that likes reading up on businesses. I own Alibaba shares.0 comments0"

RookieAnswered 3w agoI think it's important to understand what's your risk tolerance before you get your hand dirty with stocks or other financial instruments.Understanding what're the potential risks of each different products. For example, what is the drawback of trading CFD or using leverage in your trades?After you have determined your risk apetite then you can decide where you want to invest your money.Lastly, enrich yourself with investing by reading investment-related books0 comments0"
