WonderkidAnswered on 02 Jun 2019Most schools usually partner with Broadway serangoon for gown rentals and at the sane time, Broadway usually has a promotion when you collect the convocation photos to pay $100 upfront for a 50% off your next photo session with them or something.I graduated 1 year ago and that was the deal at the time.
