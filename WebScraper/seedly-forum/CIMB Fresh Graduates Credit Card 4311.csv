2,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Gotten this card days ago and after reading and asking questions here are my views.  1. It's good for students and NSF. As some might mentioned, DBS visa debit card have 5% cashback. BUT you have to meet $400min spend and keep below 3 withdrawals. But I don't spend $400 a month. Probably a max of 100-200(i only spend on food. Seldom go out. Most of the time at home).  So CIMB AWSM is good in this point. 2. It doesn't have any annual fee. Yeap. No annual fees for life.  So you can practically just apply this and keep. Don't have to worry about calling in for waiver. 3. Cashbacks on online shopping, dining&entertainment, telecommunications. This are the basic spending habits of young adults. Which is way I say this is more suitable for students/NSF/Junior workers. The cons however is that 1. Obviously there are better cards out there. But there may be a min spending.  2. CIMB Clicks interface is not that great compared to DBS/ OCBC. 0 comments2"

4,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018This card targets students, NSFs and the lower income earners. I feel that it's pretty good for the target audience since as an NSF myself, I do not meet the minimum salary for the other better credit cards. Moreover, it doesn't have any annual fees so I can just keep and use it whenever I want/need to without worrying about any fees. As for DBS debit card, I believe that it requires a minimum spending of $400 which I believe most students and NSFs can't hit, and thus will be unable to qualify for the cashback. So this CIMB AWSM credit card is a good alternative for them. 0 comments1"
5,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Nothing fantastic about the card. I would opt for Standard Chartered Unlimited Cashback Card and Amex True Cashback Card. Both earn 1.5% cashback for no minimum spending. 0 comments1
6,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Not good enough. Pros: ""The Nun"" (none)  :P Cons: CIMB AWSM card only fetches you unlimited 1% cashback when you spend on Dining & Entertainment, Online Shopping, telco. Just like what Kenneth shared also, Standard chart unlimited or Amex True Cash back 1.5% cashback with no min spend is better off and first 6 months get 3% cash back  up to the first $5k spending only.  ​if you can meet some min spending per billing cycle, can try :​(A) DBS Visa Debit earns 5% cashback:​How: 5% Cashback is awarded on local Visa Contactless transactions up to S$200 via Local Visa Contactless transactions include in-store payments made by Apple Pay,Google Pay and Samsung Pay.​Conditions: i) Need to Spend a minimum of S$400 Visa spend across any of his/her Qualifying Cards in the month.ii) Keep cash withdrawals to S$400 and below across all DBS/POSB Cards, includingqualifying cards, at local DBS/POSB ATMs and branches in the month. ​Ref: https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/cards/promotions/dbs-visa-debit-card-relaunch-tnc.pdf​(B) BOC Family visa credit card : ​Conditions:Min spend of $700 on your billing cycle.​Cash back %:Dining: 10% (cap at $30)Online: 5% (cap at $30)Supermarket, hospital biils, NETS Flashpay Auto top up, selected marchants and Telco bills combined: 5% and all other retail purchases 0.3% (together cap at $40)​Ref: http://pic.bankofchina.com/bocappd/singapore/201803/P020180327710875490784.pdf0 comments1"

I saw this card also, let me quote the main benefits:​""Introducing the CIMB AWSM Card, the card that celebrates your awesomeness and lets you be you. With unlimited 1%* cashback when you spend on Dining & Entertainment, Online Shopping and all things Telco.""​Actually, if you are in it for the unlimited cashback, theoretically, the 1.5% from the SCB unlimited card or the AMEX 1.5% true cashback card will work better? :)​Also, that you are able to actually get 3% in the first 6 months (up to the first $5k spend!)0 comments1"
