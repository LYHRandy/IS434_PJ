1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Hi Anon!I‚Äôll start off by recommending you this Seedly article breaking down the differences in CC benefits. Understanding the differences among the 4 types of benefits can help you in deciding which CC to prioritise in the future! That aside, what I get from you is that:You‚Äôre an avid Grabber and would like to benefit from your frequent expenditureYou are currently using/would like to use a Visa CCWith that, I would be focusing on earning miles and cashback from your monthly expenditure as they‚Äôre the more common benefits. Here are my recommendations:My summarised list of recommendations aside, I do advise you to do your own research on the various CCs to take note of the exceptions in expenditure and see if the terms match your expenditure behaviour.Based off what I‚Äôve researched, UOB seems to have the best deals with Grab (refer more here: https://www.uob.com.sg/grab/). I‚Äôve narrowed it down to the above 2 UOB CCs based on your expenditure behaviour ($800/month). Hope I helped!! :-2 comments6"

3,"Ronald SzieLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 24 Jun 2019I used UOB One Card, which gives 5% rebate on top of other rebates (where u spend $500 monthly for 1 quarter, you get $50), which adds up to 8.33%. The rebate comes quarterly so it's a bit slow but i guess it's the best rebates around.0 comments1"

ProdigyUpdated on 08 Sep 2019Hi there, if your spending is primarily on GrabPay, currently the best credit card reward we know of for Grabpay topups is the UOB One card, mainly because of the very generous extra 5% cashback on ALL Grab transactions (including topup, Grab Food, Grab rides) that is given above and beyond the standard cashback tiers for UOB One card (up to 5%). We also wrote a longer article detailing how to maximise cashback on UOB One card through Grabpay topups that you may be interested to check out to learn how to get the maximum rewards on Grab.1 comment0"
