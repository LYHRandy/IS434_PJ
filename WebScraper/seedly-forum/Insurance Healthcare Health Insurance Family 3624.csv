question,"Insurance Healthcare Health Insurance Family Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoWhat health insurance plan should I get for my mother?Hi everyone, my mother is a PR and she is 67 years old this year. She currently is on medication for HBP, cholesterol and osteoporosis/osteopenia. She is a homemaker and does not have health insurance so I was thinking of getting her on one. I understand that with her pre-existing conditions, these will all be excluded. Is there any health insurance plan for such situations, or is she not entitled at all to any options? Thank you.1 answerAnswerBump1"

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoIt would be best to speak to an Independent Financial Advisor to compare options. But I do have to say that due to age and her pre-existing, it may be difficult to get a policy incepted even with exclusions.Usually for elders, I'd tend to look at Raffles Health or NTUC Income due to underwriting strictness and premiums.4 comments2"

I am awaiting on my agent to let me know if osteoporosis is a definite decline or not. Do we need to submit medical reports? If so, then do we write to the hospital to request or how does one go about doing so?Hariz Arthur Maloy2w agoWait for the insurer to give their list of info required. But if any docs are required, you can ask your clinic or hospital. There might be a fee though."
