1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Apr 2019Hello! It depends on what you're trying to achieve. If you are taking a short term perspective or trying to do intraday trading, Technical Analysis will serve the purpose.On the other hand, if you are investing for long term, you need to consider the fundamentals of the stock in question. For that, Fundamental Analysis serves the purpose. You can still use Technical Analysis here for decuding entry/exit points.In short, For Trading: Technical AnalysisFor Investing: Fundamental Analysis0 comments0"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Apr 2019Hello!There is not really a direct answer for this as both types of analysis are good in their own ways. A generic answer for this would be that fundamental analysis is most often useh when determining the quality of long-term investments in markets. While technical analysis is used more in the review of short-term investment decisions such as trading of stocks in the stock market. I personally think that fundamental anaylsis is easier as compared to technical analysis. Therefore, i would think that it would be better for beginners to use fundamental analysis as it would be much easier to start off and understand. Both technical and fundamental analysis have their pros and cons. I think a mixture of both would be the best method if you are familiar with both technical and fundamental anaylsis.0 comments0"
