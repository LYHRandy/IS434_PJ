MasterAnswered on 25 Oct 2018Living under $30000 per year or below $2500 per month may or may not be possible depending on how prudent you are in your spendings and how self discipline you are in your savings. It will be viable if you are good in both but it will definitely be a struggle if you could not manage your spending and saving well. Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0

God of WisdomAnswered on 25 Oct 2018Everyone's definition of financially wealthy is different.To me, as long as I can afford what I want that'll make me happy, I'm wealthy.If you have humble tastes, I'm sure that income can be sufficient. :)But at the same time, not wrong to try and improve your lifestyle by finding more ways to increase your current income. We live in a very gloablised and flexible economy. There's always money to be made.0 comments0"
