RookieUpdated on 12 Sep 2019Self-directed means trade executions are done online, either through a desktop/web-based platform or a mobile app. Broker-assisted refers to the more traditional way of calling your broker/remisier to place the order/trade for you (and naturally attracts higher commission since the middle-man needs to be paid too).It is pretty common these days to see more self-directed trading, however in cases of emergency, you can usually still call their hotline for assistance at no extra charges for most.2 comments0"
2,"Sharmila William24 Jul 2019Is it a must to link cdp account?Terence Tan, CMT12 Sep 2019Assuming you are looking to trade in Singapore stocks, usually yes you will need to link it to your CDP account. Some brokers (usually those with a global presence) however, do not need you to link the brokerage account to CDP, as they can act as the custodian for your stocks. This is also handy when you start to buy and hold stocks from different exchanges (e.g. NYSE, NASDAQ, LSE, etc)"
