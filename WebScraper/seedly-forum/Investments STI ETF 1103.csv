After 11 years, STI ETF seats at 3100+ range. Which means if you hold the ETF till now and bought at 3800 you will still making a loss. STI ETF is an index that you can invest in. But don't just focus on one instrument. Put your eggs in different basket.0 comments1"

Investment is not guaranteed and past performance is not indicative of future performance.Instead of taking a bet of one tiny country's companies, why don't you invest in the whole world? Literally tens of thousands of stocks instead. As long as the whole world continues to grow, you are bound to get some positive return. Will it make you rich? Still no clue, but possibly a better bet than just the STI ETF.0 comments1"
