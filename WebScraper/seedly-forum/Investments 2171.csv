1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Mar 2019Another indicator that I could add on to Zann is perhaps renewable energy demand - are your EVs demand rising? Are there more hybrid cars? are governments subsidizing solar panel production and encouraging their uptake? this could signal a rise in demand for renewal energy and a drop in the demand for fuels.Vehicle demand is also a huge factor for oil - if they rise, your oil demand will rise, and vice versa.0 comments1"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Mar 2019Hello!You should look at the ratio between refinery use and refinery capacity. If the demand grows up till where the refinery is maximized, it could lead to higher prices until capacity can be increased.Also,you can look at the globabl demand as well as economic performance of countries. indicators of general economic performance such as the GDP can inform investors about the expected shifts in the demand for oil and gas. Another indicator would be to look at the government policies that are being put into place such as interest rate, taxes and regulation. These policies impact business performance and profitability. Hope this helps!0 comments1"
