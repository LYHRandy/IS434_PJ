2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019This is why the speakers are recommending to not use cpf for house if possible. Because not only you have to put back the accrued interest yourself, you also lose out the interest that CPF gives you. You dont just simply lose 2.5%.0 comments1"
3,"Aaron TngLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 10 Jun 2019I think another way of looking at it is that the money within CPF is your own money. Instead of investing in CPF, you are investing in the house. The interest is just the expected returns from investing in the property. So any gains from the sales are back to your CPF.I think it is just a matter of really poor marketing, calling it CPF loan. In essence, you are using your money to buy your own house, and returning the money you took out from your CPF account, and giving some of the gains back to your CPF as a return on investment.0 comments0"
