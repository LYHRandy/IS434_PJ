If share price volatility affect your emotion then I will suggest income investing. It is generally more stable and safe style of investing that focus on dividend.0 comments0"

You should only invest money you can afford to lose. Make sure you do your research properly before investing and learn the basics at least. Once you are done, learn which investments are suitable for your risk, goals and so on. 0 comments0"
3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Feb 2019Treat investing as choosing the best deals when buying goods. Everyone of us have different preferences and look out for different things (e.g I may prefer my fridge to have 2 doors while others may prefer to have 3). However, there are still basic requirements that must be met (e.g keeping stuff inside cool, valid warranty, etc). This can be related to profitability of the company (in the case of stocks) - cooling, protection against unforseen circumstances - warranty, valuation of the company - price vs function. At the beginning, there will be inunduated with the vast spectrum of information. Just take your time and craft a suitable model for yourself; takes a bit of time.0 comments0"
