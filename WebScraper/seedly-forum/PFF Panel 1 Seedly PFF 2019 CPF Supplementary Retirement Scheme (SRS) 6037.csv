1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019They are two different accounts.Your CPF is your Singapore provided retirement account. Your SRS is an optional retirement account (aka Supplementary), which is what the acronym stands for.In order to answer this question, I would need to assess you based on the following.1) Are you an employee, self employed or business owner?2) What is the purpose of investing in your CPF or SRS in the first place?3) What is your history of investing in these items?4) Etc etc (insert questions a consultant would typically ask here)Both are for your retirement, but SRS is typically more optional than CPF and will usually be priortized only AFTER CPF contributions.Both offer you the opportunity to use the monies to invest for tax-deferred returns, as well as to legally obtain tax relief on contributing to both accounts. SRS has slightly more liquidity, being an optional account.It would be best if you could have a Financial Consultant like myself advise you on your specific situation.
