Some funds will help you to reinvest your dividends directly, so that's an option that can be worth exploring. I think the more interesting question is how to grow your portfolio over time as you accumulate dividends.0 comments0"
3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019Hello! I personally would reinvest my dividends since my investment plans are for long term. Thus, by investing in dividends im hoping that the dividends reinvested would increase in value. However, if you are in need of money you should use the dividends instead of reinvesting it. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
