God of WisdomAnswered on 23 Sep 2019Hello there, and as Hariz has pointed out, no, you can't. Even the highest yielding instruments can only pay out 7% tops, and at $7000 a year, that's not going to be enough. I am however not factoring in leverage here, which can increase your yield to 10% or higher, but you would be at the mercy of interest rates.My own passive income off investments is in the 4 figures yearly which I took time to build (and am still building), but ultimately it is a matter of what you find will be a comfortable amount to live off. Some people barely spend $1K a month, some spend $5K. Whatever the amount, the rule of 25 combined with the 4% withdrawal rule gives you the capital you'll need for retirement to work out most of the time. This assumes that your portfolio is grown and invested while you make withdrawals to pay for your needs. Note that such a portfolio is subject to volatility which can impact your withdrawals.So $1K/mth would mean $12K/yr or a $300K portfolio of income assets. Note that I state income assets because you will want to mix it up between bonds, stocks and UTs for diversification.0 comments6"

God of WisdomAnswered on 23 Sep 2019If that 100k provides a constant 6% per annum in dividend payout, that's just 6000 a year. I doubt you can survive on 500/mth.If we look at just basic needs, plus the mortgage, and insurance we probably need closer to 2k/mth or 24k/yr.On a 6% income payout, you'll need a 400k portfolio. But then you still lose out on inflation.So if you get a 4% payout portfolio and 2% capital appreciation to hedge against inflation, you'll need a 600k portfolio.0 comments3"

Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant? Joke aside (if you are too young to understand this, heehee, nvm.)100k = 5% dividends is just $5000 a yearSay you hit dividend jackpot and you get 10%, thats $10,000$5000 or $10,000 can be sufficient for someone who has a roof and don't have to pay too much fixed cost for anything thelse.But is it sufficient for luxurious or even just a ""good retirement""?Probably not in Singapore. But i believe there are plenty of people who spend less than $5000 a year. (and more who live off less than $10,000 a year)Its really up to you. For most Singaporean, its not.2 comments2"

6,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Sep 2019100k is way too little to live off any dividends.
Think about it 5% of 100k = $5000 a year = $416 a month.Or a higher yield of say 7% = $583 a monthIf these are enough for you, sure you can go ahead and retire. But for me, these are barely liveable, even as a single who support ageing parents.0 comments0"
