1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Jun 2018So lump sum investments were analyzed by Vanguard to produce better results 2/3 of the time. And this is because while volatility can be huge, the reality is the markets are constantly increasing over time. All markets are made out of consumers and all consumers have spending power, and more consumers are born than die. You factor in wealth creationism, extreme consumerism culture as we're seeing now and will only get worse and you have markets in huge upswings.​In summary of the above, if you have a lump sum and you want to invest, do a lump sum. ​Arguments in favor of Dollar Cost Averaging are the following ​1) When you're unsure of your entry zero Value investing skill atm2) When you have a low risk profile/adverse to high volatility3) When you simply don't have the budget4) Etc.​My professional recommendation is to do lump sum investments automatically; unless the arguments for DCA apply to you. ​I'm a pretty avid investor and investment specialist, working for an FA. If you're looking for options where you want strong- return-risk ratios or if you're looking to beat the market, you can always drop me a message or follow my Facebook. I post regularly about investing, especially on Monday.​Good luck. ​​0 comments2"
2,"Tang Ching PangLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 09 Jun 2018as a beginner (myself), I do averaging cost because it required lower cost. It means that if something really happened, I lose money but lose the part that im afforardable. Probably by the time my investment knowledge is sufficient, I would like to try lump sum investment because it give better result compared to monthly distribution.0 comments0"
3,"Adam YamLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 09 Jun 2018I tend to favour a DCA approach. I came across the research on Vanguard myself and, after much hesitation, did a lump sum investment in REITs and other equity ETFs. This was in January 2018, just before the market dropped.​In the 2 out of 3 times that you do a lump sum investment and you do produce better results, you'll be happy of course. The question is: Can you stomach the sharp losses incurred after your lump sum investment if the market turns south for you? We are talking 8-10% here, more than what your REIT would pay you in a year or two. If you are not prepared to face this, then psychologically you are better off doing the DCA approach. So personally, I feel it's important to factor in how you would feel based on a negative outcome from doing a lump-sum investment.0 comments0"
