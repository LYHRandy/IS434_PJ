1,"Albert TanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 02 Jul 2019Based off your timeline, it seems you are aiming to purchase your house at age 40+. In reality you probably will require this capital much earlier. There may also be other current and future financial commitments such as study loans, marriage. It would be good to start off with a systematic way to budget your expenses, save an emergency fund, and then invest with the surplus.Most people use their CPF savings to pay for their property purchases (public or private) in SG. Perhaps at 20, you should also be looking to build up your human capital (increasing your income). Unless you have other financial resources such as inheritance, income will be your most important financial asset. Without a regular stream of income, you have nothing to invest with.It is definitely heartening to see one start as early as you. As rightly pointed out by Siow Nan, DCA will be a more assessible way to invest for the young and just starting out. MoneyOwl offers $50/monthly investment amount to get started.There is no guarantee in investment returns. CPF interest rates are almost risk free. As a rule of thumb riskier assets generate higher returns but it's not the only factor to consider in investing. High risk tolerance therefore, should not be the only consideration in investing as well.MoneyOwl's robo will align your need, ability and willingness to take risk before recommending a suitable portfolio. Being bionic, there is also a team of client advisers on hand to answer the who, what, when, where, and hows of your investment.0 comments8"

You can always diversify your investments and see how things turn out in a year time and review accordingly.
And in fact, I would also explore in terms of funds and other investments to make a good mix of everything.0 comments0"

They will help propose a suitable portfolio based on your risk assessment etc.  Not all of them will guarantee high returns and in the short term there may even be some paper losses.  Important is to stay invested and DCA over time.
Personally I have been trying out Stashaway and Autowealth.  May try MoneyOwl too in future. There is no issue having multiple robo advisors at all as they each have their own balancing algorithms and investment strategies.
For Stashaway:If you use my referral link below, you can get up to $10,000 managed for free for 6 months.  At least for first 6 months you can try out with a smaller amount without management fees.

1. Investing algorithms 
2. Fees

Companies like Autowealth do publish gains on their website albeit over the short term. And all platforms offer very good support in finding out more about their products.0 comments0"
