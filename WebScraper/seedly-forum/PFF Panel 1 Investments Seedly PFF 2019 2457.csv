1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Hi Shang! For short term goals, bond funds are most appropriate as they historically have provided the best yields and returns for short-term periods (1-3 years). Money market mutual funds are also rather liquid and safe which makes it a possible investment to meet short-term goals, although yields and returns are lesser than bond funds. For long-term goals, equity funds are best to build wealth.0 comments0"
