1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 29 Mar 2019Interesting point to note- in the '08 Financial Crisis, a similar argument was made as to whether Credit Rating Agencies should be liable since they gave Credit Default Obligations triple A rating which should be reserved only for the safest securities.This included over three trillion dollars of loans to homebuyers with bad credit and undocumented incomes through 2007. Subsequently, Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of these triple-A securities were downgraded to ""junk"" status by 2010.In short, the Credit Rating System is not foolproof as well.Also here's a pretty good article imo https://www.theedgesingapore.com/portfolio/total-compliance-financial-reporting-was-it-misleading""Make no mistake: Hyfluxâ€™s audited and unqualified financial statements are in compliance of all prevailing accounting standards. The use of perpetual securities is allowed and gaining in popularity. But I believe there is a strong case here that they must be better represented in financial statements.""Would a Credit Rating System really have made a difference? I doubt so.0 comments4"
2,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019I don;t think its fair to say that the whole Hyflux saga was due to the fact that Singapore doesn't enforce credit rating system and like you mentioned, less than 50% are rated but yet the amount of defaults in Singapore is very low. While many may argue that the lack of credit rating systems compromise the due diligence process, many of the bond holders in Singapore are actually accredited investors who should have their due diligence processes in place.I guess to not lose money in the future, perhaps you can invest in companies/bonds that are rated.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019People who lost almost everything at Hyflux were making quite a lot of mistakes.First is that they shouldnt have gone all in and should have diversify their investmentsSecond is that Hyflux financial like their debt to equity ratio and cashflow were looking pretty bad when they launched the bond in 2016 and it was pretty risky alr.Third is that an unrated corporate bond giving 6% is alr counted as risky in my opinion.Fourth is that some assumed that they were backed by government through friends, experts and think it is safe easy 6% returns even though there were no official statement that stated so. Remember its your money, dont assume that people will take responsibility if you lose everything. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Do your own research and not just believe what others say. Dont put all your eggs in one basket. You can invest in bonds but dont go all in on a single one. You can get bond ETFs or bond unit trust instead if you want bonds diversification but do not have the capital to buy multiple bonds.0 comments0"
