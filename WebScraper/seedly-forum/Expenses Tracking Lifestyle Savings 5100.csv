1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Nov 2018I've been asking myself this same question. In 2017 I clocked over 400 hours of work for 2 of the 12 months and it almost killed me. I fall sick at least 8 times a year and I'm over 10kg heavier than when I left the army 4 years ago. I've been saving a lot because I want to retire early and marry my girlfriend (of course also for my family back home, my niece and stuff - but short term objectives). She's Thai, broke and is not in the least bit interested in my money at all. The first time she almost died in a flood, I started saving almost 90% of my income so that I could give her - us, a better life. But you know girls: its not easy for them to understand why you'd rather put aside a few dollars more to compound rather than spend another day with them: so that the compounding dollars can mean comfortable years together in the future instead. At the same time, especially when work is bad (Reservist makes it very hard to maintain clients), I miss her tremendously. I would trade all the money the government is giving me for Make Up pay to spend just one day with her. Or an hour.  I'm planning for the future - quite dilligently and discipline-ly, I might add - but I'm pretty miserable. To answer your question - I do think there's such a thing as being too frugal and saving too much. Hoarding is quite unsatisfying in the long run - it doesn't create any benefit. Not for you, not for anyone you love. As for how you balance out - I think you remember that you're doing it for you, or for them, or whatever reason you're saving that money - and you have to love them more than the money itself. As a Financial Consultant, I love money. I think passive income is a magical, wonderful, societal and economic miracle and I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been born in those times. But I notice there's a point that when I zoom in about the money, the hoarding - those are the times I am most miserable. Those are the times where the richest people will take their lives or experience depression. They forgot why they worked so hard, why they saved or made that money. All the wealth in the world means nothing without someone worthwhile to spend it with or on - friends, family, wife, nieces or nephews, whatever. It really means nothing because life is about those relationships. So save away for the future, and save joyfully knowing that there's a light at the end of the tunnel (please get yourself insured so it remains there). But never put the money over the people. If your children are growing up, leave the work for the morning or when they're asleep. If your wife asks you to come to bed earlier, just do it. Simultaneously, don't enjoy life more than you need to. Treat yourself occasionally, but never make allowances unless its for the goal or its for them. Priortize those goals, so you always know - if the criteria is met, focus a bit more on saving money. If its not, take that time out to love the people in your life. I hope you figure it out - I'm still learning as well, but this is the approach I've taken the last year or so, and it seems to work for me. There are some things I feel I could do better - especially in regards to my niece and sisters, but I feel purposeful and content. I'm sure you will too. 0 comments1"
2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Nov 2018I think the way to approach this is with a goal in mind. Make a plan towards the goal. With a plan and a goal, I don't think  there's such a thing as being too frugal. Some examples of goals are as follows:Retire by XX years old - how much would your expenses be at that age, and how much would you need in order for you to not work and still maintain the same amount of expensesTo save $YYYYY in X years to buy house/get a kid/etc. How much would you need to save per month then?etcDo take into account the quality of living you'd like to have, and don't compromise it. 0 comments0"
