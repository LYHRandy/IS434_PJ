1,"Ivann FokLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 03 Mar 2019What you’re describing is “timing the market”. Ever heard the saying, time in the market is better than timing the market? There’s actually wisdom behind this. If you do the math, there is no 13 year period where you can ever lose money if you buy the S&P500. This means that even if you’re the unluckiest person in the world and bought the S&P 500 at its peak in 2008, you would not have lost money if you held your ETF for 13 years. The S&P has now way surpassed its peak back in 2008. Hence it’s better for you to get invested ASAP rather than trying to time the market. If it makes you feel better, you could split your savings in a couple of smaller pots and invest one pot every month to spread your risk across time via dollar cost averaging. Happy investing!0 comments0"
