2,"Henry Hoe Yong Zhi, Co-founder at Cantley Lifecare Pte LtdLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Mar 2019It depends on your needs. But the enhanced integrated shield plan is the most important plan that you should buy. The cost of premiums is so low because government already subsidised it with the base shield plan. Most people call it hospital plan but it does cover a lot more than that. It can be paid by Medisave, hence you may not even need to pay any cash at all, but the coverage is critical to everyone. Look into the different plans by different companies then decide from there.Next is personal accident plans. These exists in the form of health insurance or general insurance. The coverage is usually very similar, however for health insurance PA plans, they usually have higher premiums but with general insurance PA plans, if you have too many claims, the insurance company can choose not to renew with you.If you have a car, vehicle insurance is a must have, otherwise everything else is optional and needs to be custom to your disposable income, risk level, and retirement lifestyle plan.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 19 Mar 2019The one that covers all your needs for the best price.Buying insurance is not just getting one plan and be done.It's a whole financial plan that requires reviewing when life events occur. You'd most likely keep buying insurance until your 40s or 50s. It's just that the products might change a bit.0 comments0"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Mar 2019Personal insurance - I'd say you need a shield plan or a similar medical plan in place. This is to protect against outlandish hospital bills if you need to get admitted. If you have dependents, look into term insurance with critical illness and tpd coverage as well.Home content insurance, if you can. Helps cover costs of content replacement in your home should something like a fire break out.0 comments0"
