I'm guessing it just means that you are looking for a brokerage who can do that and trade?To answer the second part of your question. It simply means that you are looking to contend with the USD/SGD exchange rate fluctuations. For STI ETF (Nikko AM and SPDR) they are SGD for obvious reasons.For Overseas ETFs (eg Vanguard or SPDR world) they are USD. Best seen in Robo-advisors where you invest via SGD but the trades happen in USD, so sometimes you lose out to the exchange rate losses.0 comments0"
