ProdigyAnswered on 01 Jun 2019Hi there, I've 3 key points to suggest to you on the best PA planFirstly, some plans have unfriendly policy definitionsFor example,1) How is the ""accident"" defined. 2) How soon must you file for claims from the date you have incurred the injury.3) How much you must information (like doctors statement, original bills) you must provide before claims is assessed.Secondly, some personal accident plans have sub-limit cap when it comes to an individual claim.I've learnt this the hard way.There was a claim for a particular MRI scan for a private client and the bill was a thousand dollars plus.When we filed for claim, we only received $750 because of the sub-limit cap for outpatient treatment even though yearly limits were $4,000.It was in fine print.Thirdly, most personal accident plans do not cover for HFMD.It is common these days to get HFMD. Even for adults.I've a suggestion here for you https://www.theastuteparent.com/2018/03/sompo-pa-star-personal-accident-insurance-for-family/Premiums are $295.48/y for the middle plan if your occupation is deskbound.​0 comments1"

Honestly all of them are pretty similar.I do like Aviva's My Accident Guard a little more due to the fact that you can purchase it till age 98 unlike others who normally end at age 75 or 80.0 comments1"

Grand MasterUpdated on 03 Jun 2019I only want to avoid incidents that cause catastrophic that will casue me financial ruins, so I am not keen in those that cover small bills and incidents that a small savings can cover.I will only buy the cheapest personal accident that covers death and dismemberment, that is all. Anything frill is not as useful for me.So usually i go for General Insurance companies' personal accident plans.like this type of general insurers https://hmconsultancy.com.sg/personal-accident-covered-benefits-necessary/0 comments0"
5,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 31 May 2019I would think you might want to see how much PA coverage do you need. If you hold a deskbound job and your lifestyle does not seem to be to active, you might want to find a PA that gives minimal coverage and buy it for a just in case thing.0 comments0"
