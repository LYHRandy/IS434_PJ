1,"DeleteEditElijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 28 Jun 2019I will answer the question with a few additional pointers to address any one else's concerns on the same topic.The things to consider are:1) What is your time horizon? In your case, with 15 years, it is long enough that you may consider holding some defensive equities. For shorter time horizons, equity holdings may put your investment capital at risk. Equity funds (UT) maybe an alternative to direct investment in equities as well if you are not certain what equities to buy or are only able to allocate a certain amount monthly to build your capital. Fixed income can comprise the rest of your portfolio so as to balance things out.2) What is your risk appetite? This will determine your allocation of equity/fixed income. The less risk you are able to take, the more your portfolio should shift towards fixed income. Fixed income options may include short duration bond funds, or Singapore Saving Bonds, or bonds such as Astra V.3) Would a guarantee on part of your funds give you a peace of mind? Then a suitable endowment plan with decent guaranteed returns would form part of your portfolio, ensuring that you have a certain amount of funds ready for at least the school fees, regardless of market conditions when your child commences university. The endowment also has the advantage of having a minimum return with potential upside. However, for these to work well, the duration of the endowment will have to be more than 10 years. Alternatively, short term endowments may be an option.4) Liquidity. Another consideration is the amount of liquidity that you need to have. One of the on-going costs of university are the daily expenses. To that end, ensure that the portfolio constructed has ample liqudity if your child needs an injection of funds for purchases such as textbooks or laptop. Stocks/UT can be liquidated within days, SSBs take up to a month, and endowments are meant to be held to maturity.Combining all these together will yield a blended portfolio that should adequately address your concern. Re-balancing to take profits is also an important part of the strategy.
As an example, an endowment plan can form the basis for ensure funds for the bulk of the school fees, defensive blue chips may provide dividends for daily expenses and unit trusts may provide potential capital appreciation to take care of anything else, expenses wise. The allocation will depend on the 4 factors mentioned above.4 comments10"
2,"See all 4 comments EEva28 Jun 2019You have mentioned defensive equities is relatively a good option for 15 yrs and equity holding might not be a good idea for the same number of yrs. 

For equity fund, does time horizon matter? 

Also, you have shared a few options. For starter, is there any recommendation for which one to start with or lean towards?Elijah Lee28 Jun 2019DeleteEditBuying into an equity fund would be indirectly buying into equities. So you do need to be able to have the same investment horizon as equities, except that a fund helps to diversify your risk.

Your final selection of which options to go with will ultimately depend on factors like your time horizon, risk appetite, etc.

Speak with a consultant to ascertain your profile before you start. Setting the foundation correctly will save you from a lot of unnecessary stress later on."

GeniusUpdated on 14 Jun 2019No perfect answer but here are some choices(or alternatives).. of something you can put in a Low risk portfolio. Please DYODD1) Phillip Money market funds (currently 1.2874%pa)2) UT- short term bond funds UOB United SGD- 3 year returns 1.9466%, you can buy lump sum on poems with zero commission (some place charge 1-2% sales charge)3) STI ETF - Singapore bluechip exchange traded fund. (This probably is higher return with higher risk) about 3% dividend yield4) Maybe a bit of Astrea V bond- 3.85% coupon5) short term endowment plan eg. 3 year Aviva 2.25%, 3 year China taiping 2.28% 6) Singapore Saving bonds 2.13%pa if you hold 10yearsMany choice.. and possible combination.. Better to rebalance the portfolio every 2-3 years to minimise risk and maximise returns because market is ever changing. I can recommend you a Financial advisor from Phillip investor centre Jurong east branch if you need someone to help you.1 comment6"
4,Mujimoro14 Jun 2019Thanks. And I think rebalance every few years is good advice
5,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 26 Jun 2019For low to moderate risk options.You can look to build a moderately Conservative portfolio with about 30% in equities and 70% in bonds.Or you can purchase an endowment plan made for education planning which already invests in such a portfolio through the participating fund.Pros, you get a minimum guaranteed floor unlike an investment option, and you have smoothing of bonuses throughout the policy. This means you may not capture some years' 10% return, but in times of bad, you will not lose money.Capital guaranteed plus, can't lose money if held to maturity, plus participating in the smoothen out market return of a moderately Conservative portfolio.1 comment5"
6,Eric Chia26 Jun 2019Agreed that insurance savings will be a better option. You won't want to risk losing your children's education fees ya?
7,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Jun 2019I contributed some viewpoints on warriortan's blog before (in the comments section): https://investforyourself.blog/2019/05/13/retirement-insecurity/Having read and did research on singstat - the inflation on university education is expected at 3%. So I will rattle my thoughts and pray the insurance agents dont chew me up.To be honest, if you have to handle 3% inflation, SSBs aint cutting it if the average 10 yr yield is 2+%. Heck even cpf oa might not with its 2.5% risk free guaranteed interest.As for endowment plans, I reserve my opinion that they wont either because they tend to be low risk and deliver 2+% returns (not factoring the insurance cost, so the true return is even less than 2% probably).Sounds like a problem folks. And I haven't thought of good solutions to be honest. In my mind there's only two that will cut it. 
1) keep ploughing through the Minimum Sum Top Up and have it earn 4% on 7k each year. You can use the excess over your FRS to lend to your kid assuming your sa will be more than FRS when you turn 55, and your kids go uni after that.2) if option (1) sounds like too many ifs, then a decent portfolio that can deliver a good return. It prob has to make 6% expected given you are taking additional risk.To be honest, I will probably do both if I were in your shoes. I thought about srs, but there aint less ifs compared to option 1.0 comments0"
