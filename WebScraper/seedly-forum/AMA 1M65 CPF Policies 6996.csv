The interest rate of 2.5% for OA, 4% for MA and SA could also drop. Anything could happen and there is why you need to diversify your risk. Nonetheless, it is still better to build up your CPF because the risk is lower compared to other investment instruments. Just my humble opinion. 3 comments0"

Leverage is Risky when you do it the wrong way, Not levering is even more risky because you confirm will not be able to hedge against inflation. "

WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I took a loan of $200,000 from CPF for my 5 room HDB in 1995 for 25 years after I sold my 4 room HDB for a profit of $180,000.Use the cash to buy a 2 Bedroom in 2006 with the cash 20%.You can take the CPF out by selling your HDB and buying another but now you need to give back 50% of the profit before they loan you.This way you reduce your CPF holding too much of your Money.2 comments0"
