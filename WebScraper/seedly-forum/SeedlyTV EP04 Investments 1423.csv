1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 May 2019Dear AnonymousThank you for your question. I agree with Kah Hwee and Jonathan. While it would be good to be able to guess when a recession is coming and when markets will crash, data tell us that it is impossible to get it right most of the time. I wrote an article regarding this on the Sunday Times last month and you might want to read it here: https://advice.moneyowl.com.sg/do-not-use-short-term-information-to-make-long-term-decisions/MoneyOwl is also holding an investment symposium on the 25th of May and you may like to join us.

2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 May 2019There has been speculation that recession is about the happen, for the past few years. If you had waited from then till now, you would have missed lots of opportunities.Point is, you shouldn't wait. If a recession happens after you start investing, then you average downwards, if you think the company is resilient enough to tide through the recession.0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 May 2019No one has a crystal ball. Not even my mentor. For me, I'll just treat it as business as usual and chug along with my options port. Adjust along the way when necessary.If you are concerned, don't invest in lump sum quantities but dca into a strong stock counter. You can take a look at Maybank KE where they have a great programme that allows you to do this from $100 a month0 comments1"
