1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019I have whole life for 1-2 year annual income coverage, and a term for 5 years annual income which include CI.I do the base WL, and a term top up for high liabilities (between age 30 to 55, where your kids etc are still depending on you).For your case, it depends on your situation.0 comments1"

I however gotten Whole Life policy when I first started work around the same age as I was looking at policies that provide some returns upon surrender after holding for at least 35 years. Eventually I gotten Term Life policy via MINDEF insured under AVIVA in my 30s. Premium for 500K was relatively cheap as compared to others in market despite the rates would increase following your age increases.0 comments0

But how much term and how much whole life.But even before all that decide, how much coverage you need and for how long. If you want coverage for life (especially for illness cover), then there you go, there's a plan with its purpose in the name.0 comments0"
