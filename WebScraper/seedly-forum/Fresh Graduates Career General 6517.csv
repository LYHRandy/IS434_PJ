1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Sep 2018I was a ex Kent Ridge Scholar with NUS! :) So coming from someone who got through the vigorous process (actually it's very doable)...​Here's a plea to you... try to get a Scholarship! Most are bond-free nowadays... and you should look at the NUS, SMU or NTU websites (if you are going for local university to apply there!)​Often I know many friends who are actually pretty bright and interesting people who did not apply for scholarships because they are too afraid to get rejected. But here's the truth, the assessment varies and has been changing recently. They now look for other things outside of Academics... make your self interesting and hustle to get it.​Here's the truth, by spending 1 to 2 months applying for Scholarships... you are saving yourself 3 years of Tuition fees ranging between $30k to $50k (which will take you a further 2 years to clear when you first start working.) So why not try to take a chance... and so what if you get rejected! Don't waste this chance to save a big amount of money... for you or your parents! ​All the best!

Alternatively, depending on your field of study, you could sign a bond with the company in exchange for a scholarship.Take teaching for an example, MOE offers 4-5 years bond for you to complete your degree and gives you an allowance as well!Basically you just have to do more research on your own, to find something that caters to you!​Hope this helps!0 comments0"
