question,"SeedlyTV EP04 Investments Smartly Autowealth Endowus MoneyOwl Stashaway Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 May 2019Value Investing Versus Robo Investing?Historically, value investing has proven itself to be the most lucrative. One just needs the discipline to park an investment into a company for a long time. With my limited understanding of the ecosystem today, it does seem like specific tech giants are here to stay. Wouldn't putting my investment with them for 5-15 years give much better returns compared to robo investing or trading? Where one's portfolio is restructured based on the whims of the irrational market.2 answersAnswerBump0"

(A) Value investing - DIY methods pick your own choices of suitable quity, requires good understanding of financial statement, requires good enter and exit strategy. Best to go for classes to learn all details and points to watch out for. Returns can be xxx%. (B) Robo investing - For the busy or not keen to ownself actively manages own equity portfolio types. Allocation based on your age, income and risk appetite. Focus on time in the market rather than timing the market. Each company deploys their own strategy, usually a mix of part auto and auto balancing (thus Robo) and part human. Invest in a range of different risk instruments from bonds, golds, index and ETF. Returns ranges from 6-15%. How one knows and stays with a tech company 5-15% is the best strategy? If one enter at peak timing and faces and storm in the 5-15 years? What is the guarantee that it will out perform the Robo? If one have the time to read and notice the news and development, actively manage the equity that one pick actively, then value invesring would be the way to go. Cheers. ðŸ˜ƒ0 comments0"
