If not, it would be purely according to the valuation of a acquiring company - which may not be a fair valuation. The market is seen as a more efficient and fairer platform of ensuring that you get your money's worth on the piece of pie you are currently holding onto, and if it comes to a point in time you wish to leave the company you can always liquidate relatively easily in the public exchange as compared to private equity negotiation and valuation.0 comments0"
