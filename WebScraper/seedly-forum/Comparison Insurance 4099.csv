question,"Comparison Insurance Asked by Huang YixuanAsked on 21 Sep 2018What is the difference in whole life insurance between GE's Supreme Early Multiplier plan and NTUC's VivoLife?My agent from Great Eastern suggesting the Supreme Early Multiplier plan, I'm looking to put about $100 a month. What attracts me is that it is a whole life policy that covers for early stage critical illness as well. Or is there any other similar Whole Life Plan that has better payout?1 answerAnswerBump2"

ECI policies can be quite complex and each company has its limitations. NTUC has quite a comprehensive amount of conditions covered a total of 121, though only 101 of them are for the core plan. ​I understand the need for Early Critical Illness as I'm a specialist in this area, and would love to help you with this. I've done a comparison between all of the companies quite thoroughly, and would love to best address your need at the lowest expense to you. ​​​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
