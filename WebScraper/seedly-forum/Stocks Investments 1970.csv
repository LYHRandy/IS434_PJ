1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019SNIP: (Bloomberg) — Big banks extended losses into a fourth day Friday, as 10-year Treasury yields tumbled, the 3-month/10-year yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007, U.S. manufacturing data missed expectations and Europe’s economic outlook darkened.The Fed stated they weren’t planning on increasing rates for the rest of the year. Banks often increase rates they charge as rates go up and the opposite is true when rates go down. Even though the Fed didn’t lower rates, the flow of money from stocks to bonds this year was instrumental in dropping yield. TLDR: The financial sector as a whole is especially affected when the yield curve inverts which historically signalled the coming of a recession.0 comments0"
