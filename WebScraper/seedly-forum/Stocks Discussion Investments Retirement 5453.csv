God of WisdomUpdated on 27 Aug 2019Hi there,Looking at your budget for DCA, you just need to be aware of the transaction costs (which would be low as a proportion of your monthly budget), so I would not say that there is a ""good amount"", rather, it should be an amount you are comfortable with, incur low or zero transaction costs, and not strain your financial situation. On top of that, ensure that you maintain a war chest for good opportunities where you can deploy more on top of your DCA amount.All the best!1 comment3"

3,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 27 Aug 2019The optimal amount for DCA is an amountthat minimize the transaction costthat you can afford to invest monthly for the foreseeable future.
Cost OCBC BCIP charges 0.3% or $5 per counter, whichever is higher. Obviously, the more you invest, the lower your transaction cost. Counters available are all the stocks in the STI.POSB Invest Savers charges 0.82% per counter. However, for POSB Invest Saver, you can only either invest in Nikko AM STI ETF or an ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund.
If you invest investing less than $600 a month, go with POSB Invest Savers. If you are investing more than $600, go with OCBC BCIP.OCBC has more security selection.
Note that I am just comparing OCBC and POSB. There are a lot more companies offering DCA services and their rates/selection may be better than what I have just mentioned above.
For S&P 500 ETF, you might want to consider IUSD ETF. For your brokerage, you consider Interactive Broker. One of the cheapest.As always, do your own due diligence. On a side note, I have just started my financial blog. Do check it out. https://theinvestmentblueprint.home.blog1 comment1"
