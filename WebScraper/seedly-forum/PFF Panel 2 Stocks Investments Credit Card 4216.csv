1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hi there! Yes, Visa has been outperforming and is expected by analysts to continue its strong growth. Visa is able to capitalize on the global conversion of cash into credit, international opportunities and digital payment. Visa's moat includes a high barrier of entry to the industry and the rise of e-commerce which is the main driver for Visa's potential growth. However, some cons to buying Visa is its low dividend payout, direction of global economy and data breaches. Visa stock dividend payout is currently less than 1%, at 0.78% much lower than its competitors. Since Visa depends on consumer spending, if the economy is slowing, consumer spending also reduces. Other economic factors that affect consumer spending and card usage are employment rates, wages, interest rates and prices. As with any technology company and the rise of the use of digital financial services among consumers, Visa has to tackle challenges such as data hacks and fraud.0 comments0"
