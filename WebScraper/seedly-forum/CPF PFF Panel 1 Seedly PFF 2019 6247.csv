1,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019Anything but investment linked plans. I believe in transferring funds from OA to SA to maximize the earnings and the interest rates is quite good compared to banks outside unless you're good with investments (I'm still learning!) Also you can consider passive income  generations. There are some retirement plans which our fellow forumers who are in the industry may be able to help!0 comments0"

You can also learn how to invest yourself. After u grow ur wealth, you can use dividends for your retirement.0 comments0"
