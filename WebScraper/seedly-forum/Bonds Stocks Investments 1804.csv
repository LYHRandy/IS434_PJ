MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Here's a simple way to look at it without all the economic/finance jargon.On the basis that we must be rewarded for the risk we take, equities give more returns than treasuries (which are usually risk-free).Favourable economic condition -- Outlook for stock performance improves -- Demand for stocks increase -- Price of stock increase -- Demand for bonds decrease -- Price of bond decrease0 comments0"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019When Treasury yields go up, the opportunity cost of money increases(more properly referred to as the risk-free rate). Therefore a investors expected return of his equities portfolio must go up to maintain the same market risk premium. And as what Yang Teng has elaborated about economic cycles, treasury yields tend to go up to mitigate inflationary growth. Newly issued bonds at par-value tend to follow prices of treasury yields closely. Therefore, in times of recession, the central bank will proceed to lower interest rates by lowering treasury yields. Bonds previously bought before would be priced at a premium as they offer a higher return than new par-value issued bonds.Thus, the nature of returns is such that bonds will outpeform stocks in bearish times and vice versa in bullish times.0 comments0"
3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Stocks tend to perform well when the economy is better. This means companies are earning more profits. This can lead to inflation and the central bank may step in to increase interest rate to reduce effect of the inflatory growth. When interest rate increases, companies which require funds by issueing bonds need to pay more in terms of interest when they issue new bonds. Investors will sell off existing bonds to purchase the new bonds with higher interest. This will cause existing bonds price to fall.0 comments0"
