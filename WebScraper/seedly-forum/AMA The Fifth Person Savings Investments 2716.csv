MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019If your risk appetite is more conservative, consider the use of ssb or high yielding savings accounts like what Nicholas has mentioned. Alternative would be a fixed deposit. There are some promotions ongoing now for close to 2%.If you are more adventurous, consider buying into some s-reits, especially those who have good sponsors or those with consistent pay outs. Yield can be from 5% onwards. Downside is that there may be price fluctuations so you may realise a capital loss at the time you need to exit your position. 0 comments1"
2,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Feb 2019The best option by a large margin would probably be p2p lending sites like SeedIn or CoAssets.I'm actually really surprised no one brought it up, since 100% capital preservation is not necessary.SeedIn currently has zero defaults over the last 6 years and depending on the bond that you choose on a first come first serve basis, you can yield 5 - 17% net of fees. The bonds are flexible and can last anywhere between 6 months to two years, again entirely based on your choice and preference. You can nudge me if you'd like a referral code for 'priority' queue. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
