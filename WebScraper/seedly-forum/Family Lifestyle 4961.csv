MasterAnswered on 14 Feb 2019If I were the one spending, then definitely the picnic.I think staycation everywhere would be overpriced, and I rather save up for overseas holidays.Unfortunately there are not a lot of places in SG where you can actually see the stars.That being said, if it were sponsored then of course I'll take the staycation, cos I'm a #trueblueSingaporean that loves free stuff too0 comments1"
