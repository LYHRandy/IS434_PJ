1,"Amanda PhuaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 01 Jul 2018Hi,​Did you manage to get the name of the staff who serviced you/made the errors mentioned? I believe you can escalate the issue with all the necessary information to the customer service officer or request to speak to managers or management level.0 comments1"
2,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 29 Jun 2018Hmm this is a tough one... I would think the best way for this is to call up the bank's customer service or look for the customer service manager to sort of share your feedback? ​Unless it is a clear breach of care, then I would recommend you to report it to MAS. I have done so before for a bank which was sort of misrepresenting the Effective Interest Rate for a loan product to its customers. And they responded within a week.
