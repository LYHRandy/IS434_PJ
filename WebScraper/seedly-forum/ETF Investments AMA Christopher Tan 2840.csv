1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi anonymous, this is how you can buy the SPDR S&P500 ETF:Open a CDP account Open a brokerage account with brokerages such as Vickers, POEMS etcBuy online You can't really ""RSP"" into an ETF as it is not a fund but a security that is listed on the SGX. Besides, as there is a min brokerage fee per transaction, if you buy small amount of say $1000 per month, the cost of transaction is too high and it will eat into returns.Hope this helps!1 comment8"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Not possible to rsp into S27 (stock code for counter) here in Singapore. With a minimum of 10 shares per lot (if I'm not wrong), you are looking at about USD 2650~ at a minimum for each transaction if you choose to buy through the sgx listing. On the US side (SPY is the US equivalent ETF), its minimum one share per transaction, but depending on your broker, fees can kill. Not to mention the 30% withholding tax on dividends. What's your objective for buying into the S&P500? 3 comments5"
4,"See all 3 comments Jonathan Chia Guangrong25 Jan 2019Annualised returns for s27 or SPY are about 8.99% since inception. If you can stomach some volatility and have a long term holding period, may be a good choice. Pair it with bonds to balance out your portfolio so that your downside poses less risk. For me, I'd rather not hold SPY but trade options on it instead. Much better returns compared to buy and hold. Question Poster25 Jan 2019Thanks for your expert views, Jonathon. "
