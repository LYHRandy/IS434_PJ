1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Not very sure about SG stocks but I did a research on the top 20 listed US companies with the highest revenue exposure to China.Source: Goldman SachsLooking at the performance of Nvidia (NVDA), we can observe that the recouncilation between US and China has brought about large gains in the month of March, where its share price rose from 154.33 to ~189 as of today, an approximate 22.5% upside. Of course, not all stocks are going to perform similarly and there are other underlying reasons (not just US-China trade war) that will cause the share prices of these stocks to move. This is just to illustrate how a favourable trade outcome can benefit companies with such high revenue exposure to China.0 comments1"
