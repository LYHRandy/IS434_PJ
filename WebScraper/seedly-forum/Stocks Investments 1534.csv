1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 22 Apr 2019First and foremost, an initial public offering (read: IPO) allows liquidity for early investors and shareholders of the company.While it is true that founders usually see the benefits to maintaining private ownership (and not be privy to public scrutiny as compared to private companies) - they would still need to consider what the private shareholders want.Secondly, share issuance is a means to raise capital quickly for the company.As you can see with the recent IPOs, the amount raised is sizeable. Not only does the company amass funds, it also gains publicity which would be important for the business as well.Prestige attached to listing on a major stock exchangeYou probably might have seen those photos where a company lists on a major stock exchange and the smiling exec team is there to cut the ribbon/ring the bell etc. There is still the vanity value to listing on a major stock exchange.0 comments4"

MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019I think Enk Loui has provided a rather comprehensive explanation as to why firms would want to issue shares, but I would also like to add on the reason why so many firms seek to do IPOS: it materializes their piece of the pie, and puts a quantifiable value to their company. While companies remain private, exit opportunities for these private equity shareholders are painfully little and it is very hard to cash out on their hard work, but when you offer publically to the exchange, you get to easily increase the liqudity of the shares, and since each share are traded on the open market with a particular monetary value attached to each share you get to easily see you net worth, holdings value etc. This is why when firms IPO, the leaders become millionaires!0 comments1"
3,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019This is because there are some benefits associated to issuing shares.1) Provides cash flow for the company, especially if the management believes that the business requires cash to see it through future down cycles in the economy, or other issues that will constrain its cash flow. Moreover, this cash flow can also help to fund its projects and expansions in the future2) Less costly than debt financing as the company does not have any fixed monthly interest payments to make. This can be particularly helpful for firms that have high capital outlays and have negative cash flows. Moreover, companies issuing shares are not obliged to give out dividends to common stockholders.3) Majority shareholders can also bring expertise and connections to the company, assisting with strategy and key decision making. There is more freedom as compared to the strict debt convenants that companies must abide by when seeking debt financing.0 comments1"
