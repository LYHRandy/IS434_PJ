1,"Sin Ting So, Head Of Client Experience at EndowusLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Aug 2019Dear Anonymous,
It's a good question and something all investors should think about. Your security is a priority to us at Endowus, and I can share with you on how we safeguard client assets.
When you create an Endowus account, we will create a trust account in your own name at UOB Kay Hian, Singapore's largest broker. This trust account will handle your assets and process the transactions you make on the Endowus platform, so we never handle your money directly.
We are a licensed MAS Financial Advisor, and we can only execute transactions that you have instructed on our platform. When you withdraw funds from your Endowus account, the funds can only go to the linked bank account in your own name that you had indicated during the account opening process.Hope this helps! Please feel free to reach out to my team at support@endowus.com if you have any other questions.
