MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019Tough questions, which no one can answer for you.But generally, if you are worried about outliving, CPF Life is better because there is no risk of outliving your monies after age 91.RSS has the risk of you outliving your savings by age 91.if your focus is on gains, then it's debatable and no one has a good answer. the best is to look at Kyith from investmentmoat article on IRR for CPF LIFE.
