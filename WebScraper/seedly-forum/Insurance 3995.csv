2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 03 Oct 2018First thing first,​You can't get vitality until your kids is of legal age (18 or 21, need to check it out). Why?​Because once any policy is transferred, vitality benefits is lost to the plan (and hence you are able to deduce that vitality cannot be bought with a kids policy).​Your agent should have highlighted that to you. (of course, 1-20 years old, AIA current premiums are lower than GE, whereas after, GE is cheaper once you hit age 30).​Also, AIA makes changes to vitality quite often (yearly at least), so it may start to get less attractive. Do take note (and you also need to submit a vitality cancelation request if you want to discontinue vitality).0 comments0"
