question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Mar 2019Should I leave a job at a stable company for potentially greater job satisfaction? If yes, should I consider doing internship(s) first to avoid competition from fresh-er grads?I prioritized company stability for my first FT job. Hence, I joined one of the bigger enterprises here.I regret it. I hate the corporate culture. I haven't done active dev work with modern tech since Uni, and I don't care for learning about outdated tech I won't use outside of this job. I have zero energy to pursue any interests or self-development outside of work; I am a zombie.I feel like I've regressed since graduating last year and recently I've been having thoughts about leaving.1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Huang YixuanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I think job satisfaction is definitely one of the biggest reason for choosing your job! You will spend most of your time for the next 30-40 years working and to me it’s Super important to love your work. I think you should just go ahead and apply for jobs, no matter what you have more experience than a fresh grad so you don’t have to worry about competition there! All the best and I sincerely hope you’d be able to find a job you love (:1 comment1"
