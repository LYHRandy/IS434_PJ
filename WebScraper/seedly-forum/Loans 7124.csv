MasterUpdated on 23 Jun 2019Licensed money lender in my opinion is just loanshark with a better name.Usually for foreigners you can still take out a loan/credit card; just that they would have higher income requirements for you. I do not think a guarantor is necessary; but please provide the necessary documentations.6 comments0"

Most of the time, foreigners will need to will need to meet a higher income requirement or show proof of legal residence in Singapore. However, they may need to apply with a guarantor if they do not have a credit score.0 comments0"
