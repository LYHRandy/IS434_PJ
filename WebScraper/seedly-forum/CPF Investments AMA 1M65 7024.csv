1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018Good question.  It is always easier to see looking hindsight in life. Have the guts to search and discover your passion.  Don't be hold back by norms, culture, your parent's expectations, money or girl friend.  You will know it when you find it.  If you havent discover your passion, go and try out different things in life and keep searching and dont settle for anything else. Learn and personalise the power of compounding.  Realise that it is the 8th wonder of the world.  internalise in your heart that this is what make you rich and you need to be patient and wise to make it happen. Your insurance agent is not the one that will make your rich, they are not good advisors when it comes to invesments, they are good for insurance.  Be careful of Investment Linked Policies. 0 comments3"
