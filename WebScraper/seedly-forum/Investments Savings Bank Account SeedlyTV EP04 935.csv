1,"DeleteEditElijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 17 Jun 2019If your horizon is one year, consider factors such as your ability to take risk. If you invest for a year, the likelyhood of the markets moving against you are high. Investing works better when your time horizon is longer. You might be better off parking money in something safer.1 comment10"

Maybe for a start put your savings in a high interest rate savings account first while you explore various options. Your 1-3 years investment horizon is pretty short and you need to weigh that against your risk appetite5 comments1"

5,"Sebastian SieberLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 18 Jun 2019I think a Robo Advisor / Digital Wealth Manager is still a good choice for you.I agree with the other posters that a 1 year investment horizon is very short, therefore you have 2 options:1) Invest in a portfolio with low downside risk (e.g. 5%) and therefore lower volatility2) Increase your investment period, leaving Singapore doesn't require you to close your account here. Note: if you move somewhere else, you need to make sure you comply with local tax regulations (e.g. you most likely will need to disclose this investment in your tax declaration)I think digital wealth managers are the best option for long-term investing if you don't want to build an ETF portfolio yourselv (and avoid the high cost of mutual funds or unit trusts).0 comments0"

I’m not a roboinvestor so don’t know the info. You should check if you can keep your investments in the account even if you don’t stay in Singapore. Definitely don’t suggest you to invest if you die die must remove your money immediately when you leave Singapore. You should only invest if you have the flexibility to leave the money there, should you need to leave the country during a market down turn, it will at least gave you an option to cash out later at a better time. Do note that leaving investments in another country might result in other situations like if you need to keep a local bank account for them to transfer your investments to, can you even keep your local bank account, min sum in bank, transfer fees etc, so you need to do your homework.1 comment0"
