1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Apr 2019Saw a bearish comment online which was trendingI will let you guys do the rationalizing yourself if its fair and apt in your opinion. I myself see great truth in many of the statements. I myself believe the whole promise of the business model innovation was good, but many of the details that made the model attractive(legally not employing drivers) is now being picked apart by countries govt regulations and unions. Costs therefore are not as low as ridesharing companies like Uber would like to be. As much as worldwide growth and horizontal growth into other side domains(food delivery) is what Uber is looking at to eventually make turning profitable easier, there is a limit to its current growth potential seeing how the global ridesharing and food delivery landscape has grown to saturation in pretty much every country.The fact that Lyft is specialized on ridesharing alone just makes its prospects more confined to current situation of the battle of ridesharing against regulation.0 comments0"
