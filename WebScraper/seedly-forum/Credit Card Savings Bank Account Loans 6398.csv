question,"Credit Card Savings Bank Account Loans Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Sep 2019How do you choose the right banks to ""bank"" with? (Deposits, insurance, investments, loans)?Given that there are so many banks in Singapore offering nearly the exact same products and services. I am wondering what makes a bank ""better"" than another? (e.g. what makes you want to Bank in DBS more than Maybank?)1) How do you know and tell if a bank has your best interest? 2) What makes a bank ""safer"" than another? 3) How do you know if a bank is more efficient than another at handling your request? Appreciate it if you can share your own experience with the bank you are with today!1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 15 Sep 2019I honestly doubt there's much loyalty with banks, and that's why they had to create the high-interest savings accounts to incentivise people to bank with them.And your choices may differ depending on the kind of banking you want to do with them.If it's just personal banking, choosing a bank with ample ATMs and branches could be a priority. A decent communication channel via their app and iBanking portals would also be helpful.But if you're a business owner or own multiple real estates then choosing a bank with better credit facilities, loan options, SME funding opportunities, would then sway you to choose the banks that focus more on those aspects. You may also have a personal working relationship with a particular banker that you like and choose to patronise that bank more through that banker.And lastly, if you're a decently wealthy client and have access to privilege or private banking, there's a whole nother choice with different perks, lounges, investment advice and products such as structured notes or bonds or boutique funds that different banks may offer.Overall, you'd most likely bank with a couple or even up to 5 or 6 banks over your lifetime, so you really don't have to worry so much. All of them are regulated by MAS as well.0 comments2"
