This would give you an increased expected return, but of course that's no definite. This would mean concentration over diversification (owning 30-50 stocks instead of 500-1000), investing in small cap and value over large cap growth stocks, increase exposure to emerging market equity and fixed income which would mean buying High yield bonds.Reinvest all dividends, buy more every 10-20% dip, take an active instead of passive approach. On top of this, you can look to incorporate derivatives trading, forex trading, leveraged positions. All the best.0 comments3"

WonderkidAnswered on 25 Jun 2019Hey there anon, by yield that could mean 2 things, do you mean dividends alone or dividends + capital gain?For dividends, realistically 9% is pretty high, and the risk that comes with that high return is pretty high as well. Sure you can go for companies that offer divdends that high, but please do some research and make sure the dividends is sustainable. 1 example would be Starhub, when they offered high dividends but it wasn't sustainable, and ultimately, they had to cut it down by a huge amount.If dividends + capital gain, go for stocks that are undervalued and hold for a long time. That is literally the best advice I can give you that I know of personally.Lastly, if you don't mind waiting 5-10 years, you can just buy great companies, that pay increasing dividends year on year, and just stay invested in them, buy more when they dip and hold. Based on past statistics, if you held onto REITs such as MIT or MCT since 10 years ago, your dividend yield would have doubled, and easily reach double digits!
Good luck on your investing journey anon !0 comments2"
