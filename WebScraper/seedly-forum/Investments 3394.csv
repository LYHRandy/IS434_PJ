Imagine you put your warchest in SSB and you have to wait at least 1 month to get it out, you would have miss out on the profits. Also if you have a warchest too big, you are wasting the potential compound interest you can earn. If warchest too small, you wont profit much during market corrections.0 comments2"

If you are young and have no bills to pay for, you can afford to put more of your money inside stocks/bonds/etc. Conversely, if you are at the stage whereby you have housing loans to pay, parents and children to feed (ie many dependants), then you might want to consider allocating a larger part of your portfolio towards your warchest in case of rainy days!0 comments1"
