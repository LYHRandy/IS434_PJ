question,Investments Savings Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) Bonds Asked by jiajing wangAsked on 02 Aug 2019Why is SSB's interest rates getting lower and lower just when I decided to buy it? Should I wait it out?I have $15k cash sitting in my POSB saving acc and I want to play around with it to earn more by next month. I deposit $200 in StashAway and $200 in the DBS RSP (STI/Nikko) monthly. I do not want to put all eggs in a basket but still want to earn some interests for 1-2 months before I start spending on my marriage. Should I start buying the SSB bond now instead of waiting for next month then?4 answersAnswerBump1

Grand MasterUpdated on 29 Aug 2019Have you considered other types of bonds or corporate loans?Got this corporate loan that is backed with PARF value from LTA, which I assume is also similar to government assetshttps://timelyenterprise.com.sg/better-returns-than-singapore-saving-bonds-similar-risks/
(for those who don't have cars, PARF value is like a sum of money you pay to LTA for a new car, LTA will only refund you when you deregister your car)1 comment3"

GeniusUpdated on 03 Aug 2019In short, the US Federal Reserve just lowered its federal fund rate from from 2.25-2.5, to 2-2.25.All major central banks around the world including Singpaore, take cue from the US.And no, you should not wait it out. Nobody knows for sure when the rates are going up.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-instantview/fed-cuts-rates-for-first-time-since-2008-idUSKCN1UQ2FChttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/explainer-us-federal-reserve-rate-cut-does-it-matter-singaporeans0 comments3"

Have you maxed out to the max sum for each of those accounts ?
The current SSB returns are not fantastic and time frames are long.0 comments0"
5,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 04 Aug 2019If your time frame is only two months, why do you need to consider SSB? Granted the transaction fee is $2, but what you end up getting is 1.68%2/12  say 10000 = 28. Minus 4 total transaction costs - that's just 24 of interest for 10k of SSB for 2 months...What are your plans for life after marriage? Or at least for financing the wedding? I would suggestif you don't have a joint account, but am planning to have one in future, go for a high interest rate account like ocbc 360, dbs multiplier or the cimb 1+% one. Have your wedding budget here, then it earns decent interest while your cash is going out bit by bit for the wedding. But this also means opening the discussion on combined finances. When it becomes a common pool, it becomes easier and more transparent about family finances, not his or her money.or just compare yout current account interest versus any of those suggested earlier. The returns are not that bad compared to the ssb for short term.In my honest opinion, that's a better use of your time and effort.2 comments0"
