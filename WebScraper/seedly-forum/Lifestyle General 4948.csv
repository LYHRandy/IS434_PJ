1,"Leona GohLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 24 Feb 2019As someone who lived alone and abroad for the past 5 years... Winning the draw would be an absolute dream. For starters:Save 20% of it in a savings account Allocate 20% for a down payment for a house 30% for overall living expenses (comfortably of course) final 30% for investments I once managed to win $5000 in a lucky draw and used the money in the following way:Saved 20% for a rainny day Spent 50% for living expenses (over a span of 2 months)Spent 10% for lifestyle expenses final 20% placed in an ""locked"" savings account I would say what's most important is that you allocate certain % of the money in a bank account that prevents you from withdrawal. One such account would be the OCBC Bonus + Account! 0 comments2"

Just enough income for basic needs, while growth stocks is more to beat inflation and to increase your wealth preservation power.3) Actual split, good luck since everyone's needs is different.0 comments1"
