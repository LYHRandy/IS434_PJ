1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Nov 2018If you still have 1k, i strongly suggest that you first save up to 6 months of expenses in a bank account as a rainy day fund.If you have already done so, perhaps you can spend more time on your own personal education to have a deeper understanding of investments so that you are able to utilise your money better. With prices tumbling down since the start of this year, it may be a good opportunity to start picking out undervalued stocks when the crisis do come!0 comments0"

Savings is the mother of all investment. Save up more, then with more capital you can reduce your investment cost too1 comment0"
