Just make sure you're new to bank (never own any card from the same bank or at least cancelled the car one year before you apply ). Besides Singsaver, GoBear also does similar but offer cash or voucher or prizes.0 comments0"

Basically if you apply for a card through SingSaver, the bank will pay SingSaver some money for bringing in a customer. SingSaver will then pass you some of the money/reward they get from the bank.0 comments0"
