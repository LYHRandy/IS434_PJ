WizardUpdated 3w agoUpdate: I just saw this in my Revolut email (7 October)!Looks like they are planning to do this as well here in SG:As someone who has been pretty active on Revolut lately, did you know that you could be putting away up to Â£5.00 everyday by setting up a Vault?
Itâ€™s incredibly simple. Whenever you make a transaction with your Revolut card, weâ€™ll round up your payment to the nearest whole number and place the difference into your Vault. Alternatively, you can even set up a recurring payment or make one-off payments into your Vault.
Better yet, creating a Vault only takes a matter of seconds. So if youâ€™re planning on booking a holiday or upgrading to a new car, Vaults are a simple way to effortlessly put away for your financial goals. ðŸŒ´ ðŸš˜Â Make sure youâ€™ve updated to the latest version of the appTap on theÂ More tabÂ in the app and then tapÂ VaultsSelectÂ Add new VaultÂ and then give your Vault a name (e.g. Holiday Fund)Select how much youâ€™d like to save and in which currencyTapÂ spare changeÂ if youâ€™d like to round up your spending or otherwiseÂ Create VaultHaha funny thing you ask. If you go to Macdonalds, there is a similar thing there. When you auto checkout at the machine they will ask if you would round to the nearest dollar and donate it to the mcdonald charity fund.If it was me i may use it if my original card gives me some cashback or miles (thats the current and main game in town still)RSPs from banks now are also pretty popular with the younger tech savvy generation.2 comments2"

For Acorns, it makes sense for the user to be as profitable as possible i.e. get as much perks as possible from this such as cashback/miles on roundup change.

For Macs, it makes sense for the user to see his/her impact in giving for a charitable ... (more)Kenneth Lou3w agoDeleteEditHey Brandon! Yeah thats a fair point haha. Actually looking at the fintech space, I think there are definitely still some companies who are going to do this spare change investing thing (eg GRAB and Revolut) quite sure of it. stay tuned!"
