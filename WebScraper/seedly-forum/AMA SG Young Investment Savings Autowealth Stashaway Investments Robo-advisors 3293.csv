question,"AMA SG Young Investment Savings Autowealth Stashaway Investments Robo-advisors Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Sep 2018I want to save about $370,000 in 10 years' time and stop work. I can start putting aside about $2400 towards savings and investments. But what's the best way to do this? Also, I've got a 3 room flat that I can continue to rent out after I stop work but I don't want to rely on it for an income. I took a HDB loan and I'm paying for it via my CPF. I'd feel more comfortable putting the rental income into my CPF.10 answersAnswerBump2"

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 30 May 2019Gosh, I have saved that amount a few years back, but still don't feel like stopping work. But that's probably because I don't want to stop working for as long as I can, to keep the mind and body active. But I reckon you already have things you plan to do with your time!That said, the easiest most straight forward way to do this (not taking into account any kind of returns, and inflation) is to save S$3k a month.But we all know we have to factor in inflation in 10 years time, and for that reason, should look at investments.I would still look at getting income from the 3-room flat, and also put my money to work right from the start in equities and bonds.And with the free time, still pursue something you have always wanted to do! It's easier to do when you have 'F.U.' money.0 comments1"

3,Leong Wen Fong03 Oct 2018What's your experience with Autowealth? Is it a good platform to use?
4,"Chen QijianLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Sep 2018Basically given the situation, you need a annual rate of 5% to hit your goals.​Cash earns you close to zero (granted some accounts gives you 2% and more but that caps off after 50k)​Given that its unrealistic to keep a zero cash allocation, that means that your investments have to yield above 5% - depending on your level of familiarity as well as luck it can either be an easy cap to hit or really tough.​I would distribute it across a mix of equities and fixed income products - no ILPs or whatever nonsense cause that yields too low. ​Probably something like 60% global equities and 40% fixed income0 comments1"
5,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Work backwards. $370k/10 years = 37k/year = about 3k a month in savings.​So based on this calculation, you need another 600 to top up to your 2400 a month. 2 comments1"
6,Leong Wen Fong11 Sep 2018I guess if he invests the wait can be shortened by about a year?Gabriel Tham11 Sep 2018depends what is the rate of return. And investment also carry risk of loss unless is FD or SSB
7,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018To achieve that you need to save at least 3k/month. So use your 2400, half of it in SSB and the other half in a robo-advisor. Alternatively, you can look at areas of your expenses and see where could be cut down. So that you can save/invest more and hit your target earlier than the projected 10year.0 comments0"
8,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Few assumptions on your questions. $2,400 mentioned is on a monthly basis, S$28,800 a year or US$20,000 (plus minus a bit) a year. Also gonna assume you roughly know about the choices of investment vehicles I will mention. Lesser risk / easier to stomach in Singapore context vehicle is a basket of reits. Set aside every month and invest in one lump sum, or consider doing dca via platforms like maybank ke. Depending on sector, you may be looking at between 5-7% yields on the ones with strong sponsors. Reinvest the distributions back into the selected reits. Alternative to this is robo advisory, maybe stashaway since they do not have a minimum amount and can take in US dollars. Now if you are less risk adverse, you can consider creating a portfolio of options on stocks in the US market. Sell put options on good stock counters and generate income. Benchmark for returns is around 30% or more per annum. You should hit your target by around year 7 or 8 using this method. I'm personally using this to fund my retirement, looking at a timeline of 3 years or so. All the best! 0 comments0"
9,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018FIrstly, you can start tracking your expenses. Download an expense tracker (I personally use the seedly app as well as ClevMoney), and input a transaction in everytime you spend/receive money. Sounds troublesome, but trust me, it will go a long way in helping you reduce your expenses :)​After you start tracking your expenses, you can then review it monthly and cut away expenses you don't need. For me, that means no drinks other than plain water during meals (good for health too!), walking/cycling instead of taking the bus, etc.​As for investments, you can start by looking at regular savings plans. Seedly has an article talking about it, which can be found here: https://blog.seedly.sg/regular-savings-plan-the-piggy-bank-for-working-adults/ .​Good luck and all the best!0 comments0"
