God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You're unable to contact your advisor to help you with this? You're paying for his expertise through the plan structure.But what I may suggest, because the plan has a high cost structure, I would suggest you go for a 100% equity position and invest elsewhere for a more balanced portfolio.Definitely look at Fundsmith Equity Acc fund. It's a global equity fund with an insanely good track record and one of my favourite ever fund managers. Terry Smith.2 comments3"
2,"Question Poster13 Nov 2018Hey. Thanks for your reply! I didn't contact my advisor because of past issues and it was actually my own personal choice to get this investment plan. I was thinking of contributing to robo-advisory platforms such as Stashaway.  Would like to have your opinion on that. Thanks! Hariz Arthur Maloy13 Nov 2018You can take a both strategic and tactical approach to your portfolios. Setting up a globally diversified portfolio on both platforms are possible. But with the available funds on Axa's platform, you can use it as a tactical approach and choose your investment allocations and options.

For robos, you just accept their choice. And there's no chance of beating the market at all. You'll always underperform in each category but remain positive due to prope... (more)"
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Nov 2018I believe Pulsar is without life insurance (just something like a death benefit)? Personally I never like investment plans with insurers as the cost structure is very high. You would really be better off in the long run if u move to a much lower cost platform. If u are an accredited investor, it will be the same that u can access your said funds using other platforms. Which funds are u refering to? the jpm small caps fund? Add me on facebook if we can discuss further. If u need advice on where to get the most cost effective insurance, and investment strategy. 0 comments2"

WonderkidAnswered on 13 Nov 2018Off-hand, it would be disadvantagous to you to surrender the whole policy after 2 years. Effectively all you would get back is the partial value of the contributions made from the 19th month onwards. The first 18 months will be fully surrendered.You may consider reducing your contributions down to the minimum but your fees will still be based on your initial contribution amount (this amounts to a higher TER).Taken from their brochure:Early Encashment Charge (EEC): Account value of first 18 months premium x EEC% EEC% = 100% for first year: the rest is with reference to number of years in remaining premium payment term years.Do contact me via LinkedIn if you would to discuss this further. https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-fong-sjp/0 comments0"
