1,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 31 Jul 2019Hello!It would be a great help if you could understand how to read financial statements, such as income statements, balance sheets and cashflow statements. These statements can be found in the annual report of companies listed on stock exchanges. These statements form the basis for quite a good number of investments, as they tell about the financial health of the company! Companies can smoke investors by saying that they their company has performed very well over the last few years, but numbers don't lie. More importantly, asset classes such as stocks, bonds, ETFs and REITs all utilises financial statements to understand what kind of investments to develop. You can read more about financial statements at the following sites:https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsbegfinstmtguidehtm.htmlhttps://www.thebalance.com/guide-to-understanding-financial-statements-357512https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/certifications/financial-modeling-valuation-analyst-fmva-program/Video:https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-statementshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkse-Wafe9U1 comment1"
