1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 01 Aug 2019Just get the Krisflyer AMEX first for their sign up bonus.After which, get the Citi Premier Miles and/or DBS Altitude Card.Pros:1) AMEX usually has better sign up bnous and they are easier to achieve.2) Citi PM and DBS Altitude Card points don't expire so you can transfer when you reached the points needed.3) Citi PM can transfer to other airlines' loyalty programCons:1) AMEX directly credit the miles to your Krisflyer account so the 3 year expiry starts immediately2) CITI and DBS has a fee when transferring over the pointsDon't mind me for being straightforward but If you accumulate miles just for redemption on economy class, getting a cashback card might be better.2 comments3"
2,"Valentina Tan01 Aug 2019Hi, could you elaborate why you feel that getting a cashback card might be better, if we’re just accumulating miles for economy class redemption?Aik Kai01 Aug 2019Because redeeming miles for economy class seats represents poor value.

Take for example a flight from Singapore to Tokyo via SQ. For simplicity sake, let's assume the cheapest flight SQ offer is $650/person, round trip, all in, for a grand total of $1.3K

1-way economy seat cost 25k miles, meaning round trip is 50k miles for 1 person. 2 ... (more)"

4,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 17 Oct 2018Get the krisflyer amex first for the sign up promo. Then sign up for the citi prem miles for the promotion and for future usage.I use uob ppv for pay wave for the 4mpd. And citi rewards for 4mpd on shopping (if pay wave not accepted). For dining, online shopping, etc I use BOC family card for the super good rebates. Anything else I use uob prvi miles for 1.4mpd. I hold a dbs altitude card for its free priority pass. You can make use of its sign up promo too. Within 2 years I have at least 100k+ miles. 0 comments1"
5,"Sa RahLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 06 May 2019THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU APPLY FOR CITIBANK CREDIT card especially if you are always travel and can't keep track on the date. Secondly, there isn't many perks. The customer service is based in Manila which take at least 15 minutes waiting time to speak to someone and line is absolutely lousy.  NONE A SINGLE ISSUE will be resolved even if you speak to them. Go for DBS & AMEX for overseas and daily used! HIGHLY RECOMMEND DBS & AMEX!!!!0 comments0"
