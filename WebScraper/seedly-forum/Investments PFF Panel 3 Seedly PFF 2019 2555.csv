WonderkidAnswered on 20 Jun 2019I dont think theres an absolute rule, but check for times of global market stress / consumer staples industry stress and see how the management responded in terms of dividend declared. Also, check that the dividends are less than the earnings (some companies ensure a dividend yield by paying more than their earnings, dipping into their cash, which is not sustainable)0 comments1"
