1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Mar 2019I agree with Richard that this is one of the lessons that we can learn! You will most likely not be always right when investing in, and investors usually make mistakes along the way. I think the key is to focus on being right more times, and being wrong less times, since it would almost be impossible to be completely right all the time. Something else we can learn is also not to blindly follow our idols when they invest, but to also pay attention to our own investment strategy and goals, and to have a reason to make an investment in the first place.  Buffet has his own reasons to continue holding the shares, but we ourselves also need to do our own due dilligence.0 comments0"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019That everyone makes mistakes! However, the greatest lesson here is not that the great investors are fallible, but they learn from their mistakes, and look back to see what went wrong. In this interview Buffet talks about how he had initially viewed Kraft Heinz, views on the future .( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEP7RUKuI0U )Buffet has still maintained Bershire Hathaway's stake within Kraft Heinz, which still shows his commitment to his investment strategy of the long term - he bought in because he thought KHC will grow, and he still believes so. for him, he doesn't get emotional even when he lost millions on this deal, which should be a really important trait to pick up for investing!Keep cool, trusts your analysis and the numbers, and learn from mistakes made to make your strategy better!0 comments0"
