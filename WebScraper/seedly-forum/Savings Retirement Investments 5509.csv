1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 03 Apr 2019The way I see it (which is also the reason why I'm starting my investment journey now) is that at every stage of our life, we need to have some sort of financial planning and objectives to meet our immediate and long term goals. For me, its not really a matter of planning for retirement at this age. Rather, it is a matter of planning financially for the various milestones from now till retirement, so that I wouldn't need to worry much during retirement.For example at our 20s, we should plan on how to accumulate wealth for investing while simultaneously clearing our liabilitiesAt our 30s, we are going to plan how to best allocate enough money to support our parents, have a semi-comfortable life and plan for your child(ren)At our 40s, we are going to plan on how to have a sustainable nest egg while at the same time, reaping the fruits of our labour from the cyclical 9am-6pm years.Hence, if you were to break down ""retirement planning"" into milestones in life and think about it, its never actually too early to start.Hope I don't sound too preachy but this is something that I really believe in!0 comments3"

Currently a uni student, my plan is to probably start saving for retirement once i manage to find a full time job post graduation. By starting to save earlier, it would mean that you would be able to have more time to grow your money, and that is where the power of compounding would come in to help you to accumulate your wealth! With that said, while saving for retirement is important, we should always consider the stage of life that we are in when it comes to what we plan to do with our money.0 comments0"

The power of compounding helps in this area for people who started investing/saving money at a younger age because time horizon will be much longer than those who started later than you.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Here's the thing, we know for a fact, that we will, and want to retire some day. 100%.It's actually one of the only reasons we go to work and even consider making money. So that we can live, and one day not do it anymore and still live. I would argue, that we need to plan for retirement from Day 1 of our working life. But at the same time there are so many other things we need to plan for as well. Planning is holistic. You have to take into account all milestones and events that will happen. Do it all together.0 comments0"

You will still be able to retire even if you start later but it will be tougher as well.This article is an example on how starting early with compound interest will help you a lot.https://blog.seedly.sg/easy-way-get-rich-compound-interest/0 comments0"
