1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Jun 2019You need a CPF investment account to buy gold etf. But buying gold with CPF money is not a very good choice. This is because CPF gives a minimum 2.5% which is already beating inflation numbers. Plus, it is guaranteed. Gold on the other hand can fluctuate in price. It will not payout dividends nor interest, this means when you hold gold, your CPF OA invested in gold will not compound at 2.5% every year.0 comments1"
2,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Jun 2019I dont think it makes sense. Modern gold prices seem to have lost their ""oopmh"", and dont seem to stack vs inflation. Cpf oa itself gives 2.5%, and thats already better than most ssb 10 yr average yield. It would be more useful to adopt a minimum rate of return, after considering the additional risk vs safely earning 2.5%.I set my minimum expected return for cpf oa returns at 5% otherwise its very easy to end up worse than if you had not tried to do anything.0 comments0"
