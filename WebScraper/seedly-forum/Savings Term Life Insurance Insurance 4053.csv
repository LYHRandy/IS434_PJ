1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Oct 2018Yup! what Kenneth mentioned is correct!As for alternatives, price-wise at $41/mth for S$1M coverage, nothing beats that. But there are some downsides you should also take note of:1) Premiums increase drastically from Age 66 onwards.2) Premiums are non-guaranteed, meaning Aviva can choose to increase premiums if they find the plan unsustainable3) You do not own the policy, which may affect you when it comes to legacy planning in the futureIf you are also considering the riders, do also note the the riders for Early Critical Illness only covers 10 conditions.Hence, would suggest that you consider other alternatives for coverage for early critical illness. PM me should you need more clarifications! I may be reached at www.facebook.com/brandan.chen0 comments0"
