1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Mar 2019Building on what Zann mentioned, there are also other forms of valuation availible such as the Discounted Cashflow analysis. Another form of valuation is precedent transactions. An investment banker might analyse previous IPOs of companies that are similar and work some form of multiple there.0 comments0"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019Hello! IPO is valued based on the demand of the company. A strong demand for the company would likely mean that it has a higher valuation. It does not mean that the company is more valuable, it merely means that it has a higher value. Another way that an IPO is valued is by industry comparables. If the IPO candidate is in an area that already has comparable publicly traded companies, the IPO valuation may be linked to the valuation multiples that are being assigned to competitors. IPO valuations also depends heavily on the company's future growth projection. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
