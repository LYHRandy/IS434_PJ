Maybank (Highest base interest of 0.3125%)OCBC 360 Account (high bonus interest if you use their services like salary crediting, credit card spending and monthly increase of your account balance)Honourable mentions:UOB One accountDBS Multiplier account/ POSB SAYE account (With salary crediting, investing and also credit card (DBS live fresh expenses), youâ€™ll be getting 2.2% interest for your first $50k, neat!)Standard Chartered BonusSaverPro & Cons of a joint accountPros:Useful for managing coupleâ€™s shared bills/ home expenses (simpler and faster than holding on to your bills and trying to split them all later)Two pairs of eyes for oversight (Easier to keep track of finances because all expenses come out of one account)Cons:Conflict (issues like student loans, credit cards, alimony, child support and other debts might make the other spouse feel responsible for paying the debts with the joint funds so communication is important!)Danger in case of messy breakup (if the relationship ends, funds can be messy to separate)Whatever you decide, the most important thing is being on the same page with your partner from the very start.Hope the above helps a little! ðŸ˜Š0 comments3"
