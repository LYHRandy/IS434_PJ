1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Mar 2019I've stopped using TA because of the number of times false breakouts happened.FA is dependent on the type of stock, the industry it is in, and what I'm buying it for. My screening criteria for dividend vs. value stocks are completely different. Also for growth stocks - for eg, I use P/E as a consideration while analysing value investments, but it falls flat for growth stocks so I don't bother.0 comments1"
