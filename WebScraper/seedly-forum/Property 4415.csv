question,"Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Jan 2019Will I be able to afford a resale Maisonette worth 750K?I will begin working in May 2019 (job in government sector with ~$4600 salary (gross income) while my fiance is already working since March 2018 with a salary of $2800. We are looking to get a HDB maisonette worth 750K as my mom is willing to pay 100K for the downpayment. On top of that, I have around 15K in CPF while my fiance has around 10k. Is it wise to get a maisonette near the MRT with 67 years of lease left if I'm not planning to move? Or stick to my BTO at fernvale and move in future?2 answersAnswerBump0"

ProdigyAnswered on 06 Jan 2019If your HLE should comes out to be around $450k-$500k, this mansionette at $750k may be out of reach.  Home buying is a very personal choice. As to sticking to your BTO, you may read this post why I like BTO for a different opinion. Good luck!0 comments0"

My monthly mortgage is $1,250 combined with my wife.For your case,. It should be roughly double of mine. 
Your monthly mortagege should be $2,500 a month, (includes CPF payable). How you split it between your wife and you is entirely up to you. Do you think you can afford it? I think that the question.I have yet to dive in the specifics of housing depreciation etc etc. 0 comments0"
