question,"Bank Account Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Jul 2019Should I put money into the MSA since it has better interest rate as compare to the 'normal' savings account?Hi all, I am taking a look at my accounts and realize that the annual interest rate is not stated unless I have to do some online searches for it (if anyone knows how you can view it in the ibank, please do tell me ^^ ). Currently I have an Ocbc Plus account (debit card) and Ocbc MSA. Likewise the same for Posb, one that was created back in Pri. School days and a MSA too. Between these 4, would it be better for me to park the money in the MSAs? P.S I am a student.1 answerAnswerBump0"
