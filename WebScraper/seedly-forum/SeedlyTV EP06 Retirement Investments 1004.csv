1,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Jun 2019Right now I think there are no specific roll out dates. The news was from 2016 and it didn't state any specific date that it will start the program. However, you can explore more on funds and stocks currently with your CPFIA instead of just waiting for the new program to roll out.0 comments0"
