But there are quite a few cons on relying just on a group insurance policy.First and foremost, you don't own the policy. Terms and conditions can change at anytime. Also, for the mindef term, the ECI rider is lacking. It doesn't cover barely enough conditions to make it worthwhile. I'll probably only use half of all my coverage needs with a group policy if I'm budget concious.0 comments0"
