God of WisdomAnswered 4w agoI would say you are ahead of most people who are at the age of 35. However, I am not sure how much your properties are worth, and I would also want to highlight that if most of your wealth is in properties, you would want to look at boosting your liquid assets.To put things in perspective, if you had to choose between 2 options: A) $2m property and $500K cash vs B) $500K property and $2m cash, which would you choose?Still, you are doing great! Definitely ahead of most peers of your age.3 comments5"

Unless your possession of a car generates income for you or greatly enables your ability to generate income. Don't keep up with the joneses, you'll live a happier life that way."
