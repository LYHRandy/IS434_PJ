1,"Douglas Chow, Chief Enlightenment Officer at Empower AdvisoryLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi Junyuan, Douglas here. 2nd keynote speaker.Reits are fine. U just have to be selective too. Not all reits perform and some do pretty badly like ESR Reit and AIMS AMP. Analyse a reit just like any stock, understand the assets they own and manage and the risk these assets face. Time your entry in and out the best you can. All the best.​​​
