WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi, Douglas here. 2nd Keynote speaker.The main difference between the two is that SIBOR is more steady while SOR (Swap offer rate) is more volatile.SIBOR stands for Singapore Interbank Offered Rate. It is simply an interest rate that banks in Singapore charge to each other. So it's pretty Stable.If the SGD strengthens against the USD, there will be a downward pressure on SOR, decreasing its value. The opposite happens if the greenback strengthens against the SGD. As the SGD/US exchange rate fluctuate, you can expect SOR Rate to fluctuate in tandem.If SGD weakens against USD (to boost Singapore's export), you can expect SOR rate to go up. Of cos, with the trade dispute between US and China now, it's impossible to predict with accuracy how the USD/SGD exchange rate will play out since MAS pegs SGD to a basket of currency.For more stability and peace of mind you can opt for SIBOR which is what i did for my first property loan more than 10 years ago! And u can refinance when the circumstances dictate.​​​
