1,"SWShaun Wq LimLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Apr 2019I usually use the manual Cash Wallet function to track my expenses that I have paid with cash and also to set a cash budget. Meaning I pre-fill the amount in the wallet and the expenses will draw down from that amount. For the rest, itâ€™s automatically assigned when you sync Seedly to your bank accounts. For example, in my OCBC accounts, I would have 
1. A savings account entry (OCBC 360)
2. A credit card entry (OCBC 365)
3. An investment entry (OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan)
4. A loan entry (OCBC EasiCredit)You can also set up manual(self-created) accounts for each of the categories too. I have used 
1. A manual Loan account to track my CPF Education LoanManual Insurance accounts to track my CPF Special Account and Medisave Account Manual Cash account to track my emergency fundHope the information is helpful!0 comments1"
