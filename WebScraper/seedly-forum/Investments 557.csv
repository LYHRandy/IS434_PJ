Grand MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019Read up a lot.(take a course if you want to learn it faster)but I will suggest read a lot. The best way to learn trading is to read through the numerous option books on it, find a strategy that fits your character and test it weekly, daily on your trade (with small capital) and grow together with your knowledge.Took me 15 years to reach my current trading status.I will suggest go to the library and search for ""options trading"" or ""option selling"" and find a book you like.. OR google for it.tons of good stuff. free stuff as well as paid premium stuff. you will learn lots of different tactics.Friday day trades, all the different shorts and longs of options...0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Apr 2019Assume you are looking to trade options in the US market. You need to open a brokerage account with either Td Ameritrade or interactive brokers. You will also need to pass a SIP test with SGX I believe before your account can be approved.You may also want to find a mentor to teach you on options trading or on options portfolio management. This is due to the amount of risk involved and losses may be unlimited if you are not sure of what you are doing. Also to help you get started quickly and correct mistakes. I went down this path and did not regret it. 30% returns or more is very achievable on an annual basis if you can manage your portfolio well. Hope this helps0 comments0"
