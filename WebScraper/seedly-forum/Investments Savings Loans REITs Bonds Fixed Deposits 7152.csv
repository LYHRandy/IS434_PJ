I'd clear anything higher than 4% per annum.For your HDB loan, instead of trying to clear it quick, just switch from paying with CPF to paying with cash. Btw, Bonds and FD will only give you about 1.5-4% return. Clearing your loan would also give you a similar ""return"".2 comments2"
2,"BBesey10 Apr 2019Interesting about paying with cash instead of CPF for hdb loan, why so?Hariz Arthur Maloy10 Apr 2019Because you earn 2.5-3.5% interest on your OA. So you lose out on this and have to pay it back to yourself when you sell your house."
