You can use this tool which we built for people living in Singapore (there is no seperation between locals or expats!)Savings account calculator: https://seedly.sg/tools/savings-account-calculatorNext you can actually find out which suits you best from this article we wrote as well. We are not sponsored, so what you find is really what we think is best for our users... likely to be DBS or OCBC or UOB (some of the larger banks in SG)https://blog.seedly.sg/best-savings-accounts-singapore/0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Depends on what you mean by ""best"".1) If you're looking at interest rates, consider the higher interest savings accounts offered by many of the banks. You will get higher interest rates just by getting your salary credited to that account.2) If you're looking at the ease of transferring money abroad with better exchange rates, the multiple currency accounts (such as the one by DBS) would be suitable.0 comments0"
