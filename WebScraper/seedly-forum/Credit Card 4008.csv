1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 28 Aug 2019Your question a bit too many parts and too vague ah.Break down a bit:Utilities, incomes tax, telco bills: Typically 1.2mpd. S&CC transactions typically don't earn miles as they are excluded by most banks.Local spending: What categories? Using the right card for each category can give you up to 4mpd so this one you need to do homework. But let's assume 1.2mpd as this is the average.Example of monthly spending converted to destinations like Taiwan and Japan on any airlines: What cabin? I am assuming Business. Different airlines have different award chart so let's use SQ.SQ charges you 47k miles one way to Tokyo and 30.5K miles one way to Taiwan on their business class cabin. Round trip is x2 so 94K for Tokyo and 61k for Taiwan for 1 person. Assuming you earn miles through cards that have 2-year expiry for the miles earned, you need to spend $78,334 within 2 years for a round trip to Tokyo. Break it down into 24 months and you need to spend $3,264 per month on cards that give you 1.2mpd.I am just painting a general and sort of pessimistic scenario here but it would be good to share more details so we could work out a more feasible plan.Cheers1 comment0"
