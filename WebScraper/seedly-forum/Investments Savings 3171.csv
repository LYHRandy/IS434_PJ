The rates should be out in the link below tomorrow.http://www.sgs.gov.sg/savingsbonds/Your-SSB/This-months-bond.aspxwhat's the interest rate you're getting at CIMB now? compare it with the ""Average return per year"" on the second year, since you are withdrawing in 2020. if it is higher than the interest rate at CIMB, i would say go ahead..Do take into account the $2 fee for each ssb transaction though (buying/selling)0 comments1"
