1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018Leave money inside and let it compound! I will leave to funds to snowball and grow all the way beyond 65, 70 - and I will withdraw it only when I need it. The interest rates are very high and CPF is very stable. I will keep the funds inside for as long as I can to let it grow exponentially.  0 comments0"
