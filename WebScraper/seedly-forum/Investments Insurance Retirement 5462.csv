God of WisdomUpdated on 10 Aug 2019The rules of thumb are:10 X Annual Income as coverage in the event of death + any liabilities owed5 X Annual Income as coverage in the event of illness + upgraded hospitalization insuranceInvest a minimum of 20% of whatever you earn for RetirementSave 5% of whatever you earn for Children's EducationHold a year's worth of expenses as emergency cash. You can afford to invest everything else.I'm not sure what other assets you are holding, but if you are planning to save 2m in 10 years, it would be quite difficult. Even investing 100k/yr, you'll need a constant 15% return.I would suggest sitting with an Independent Financial Advisor to go through the above and create a portfolio that would allow you to realistically achieve your retirement goals.I can go through a plan for you that would include your accumulation years to compound returns and then a switch to a distribution strategy to start living off dividends from your nest egg.0 comments4"
