question,"Lifestyle Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Nov 2018I was offered a job in Singapore, and in UK. It was always my dream to work overseas, and I chose that job over the one in Singapore. However, it is a nightmare and I hate working here. What do I do?I don't hate the company, but I just don't like the way things are in London. I felt like I made a bad decision, because the job in Singapore was actually better and higher paying. Now I feel like I'm stuck here..5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 20 Mar 2019I once was in the situation where there was a job prospect in New York, but I turned it down despite a much higher salary because of several reasons:1. Savings: After deducting tax, rent and general living expenses, I would have no savings at all. This did not make sense to me, as my goal was definitely wealth accumulation. 2. I had no desire for the NYC lifestyle: Unlike my peers who probably thought it would be glamorous, I had zero desire for the city life in NYC. In fact, when I saw so many homeless people sleeping on the streets (and even outside the Apple store), I immediately thought about home. 3. Being close to loved ones: I do remember that when I flew to NYC for interviews, I could sense that my parents weren't too excited about it, even though they did say that they were supportive/I should go for such opportunities. So, I would say to consider the following factors:Have you given yourself enough time to settle in? It could be a temporary feeling of regret, and you might grow to love London. Have you given yourself a timeframe for London?What are your options when you come back to Singapore? In any case, Singapore will always be home, so there is some comfort in knowing that.Perhaps you can find a Singaporean society in London, and you never know, that might reverse what you think of London!All the best!0 comments1"
2,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Nov 2018Weigh the options of coming back! Do you have a job here ready for you when you return? Wouldn't want to come back and get stuck in limbo. Something else would be to consider the costs involved in moving back, depending on how long you've been in London and if you have already settled down there with lots of things to send back. Perhaps give it awhile more to try and accept more of the place, try to see things differently. If the feeling that you've made a bad decision still remains, plan your options out and make a choice. All the best!0 comments1"
3,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Jan 2019What is it that you hate? Is it something that definitely will not happen if you’re working in Singapore?There’s bound to be some cultural differences working overseas, have you given yourself sufficient chances to adapt to them?Also, do you think you’d be able to just bite your tongue and work the needed hours then just spend the remaining time for self-care? Even in Singapore I know there are people who absolutely hate their job, but are just in there for the money or stability. Do the necessary then live your life however you want after office hours.But if after some time (maybe beyond 6 months) and you still feel really miserable, maybe you should come back. And if you need a constant source of income, pls make sure you have a job offer in SG before returning.Really nice to have you on Seedly even while you’re overseas!0 comments0"
4,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 Jan 2019Are you sure you really don't like the way things are, or are you just homesick? If home sick, give it some time for yourself to adapt. There's actually pros & cons to both options, as you mention, you don't hate this current company, just the situation in UK, what's to say that you will like the company of the Singapore based job, even if it has a higher pay? How's your work life balance & lifestyle in UK? Will you be able to get the same in Singapore? You don't have to regret your decision, it's not all that bad, having worked overseas before can actually boost your portfolio, and make you more employable, but you do have to work for at least 1-2 years min to have an impact, so try to tahan at least that long. Is your company a MNC? If it is, you can try asking for a transfer.  Whatever decision you make just make sure the employment opportunities are available before throwing in the letter.(If you are facing discrimation in your company, start searching for job opportunities and try to get out ASAP, but highlight this issue to a neutral person before you leave, nicely, of course. If you are facing it outside, try to get some advise from the nicer people in your company)0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 27 Nov 2018You should check what are your available options in Singapore right now if you were to move back.Also how long have you been in London? If it's only for a couple of months, you may be selling it short. It could grow on you. Undoubtedly it could be a once or twice in a lifetime opportunity to work overseas. Maybe you could try being more involved in the community? Just suggestions to hopefully make it easier to stay there for the time being. You could also suggest to your company to set up an office in SG, and hopefully you can head it or be in the startup force for it. But last but not least, you can always quit and move back, I'm sure that's never not an option. 0 comments0"
