WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019To 'hang out with friends and go out occasionally' might not need as much money as you think, or at least it should not have to thwart your savings plans!Coming from someone who has been a saver since my very first internship, I have always been looking for creative ways to spend time with friends and family. Assuming you are based in Singapore, I personally feel Singapore is a great place to have hangouts that usually don't cost much (unless your definition of hanging out has to be an atas one - Champagne Brunch, anyone?'Activities you can do with friends:1. #my10ktoday: Work up a sweat by taking a run along the Marina Bay route. Many people do it in groups, and it's essentially free. Same logic goes for hiking/cycling/etc. at the various Nature Parks in Singapore. 2. #sghawkerculture: Skip atas high teas and fancy brunch places and get a $1.50 drink with friends at local kopitiams! Support local hawker culture ;) 3. #theatresonthebay: Catch a free performance at Esplanade. They tend to have something good every weekend - so if your friends are arts lovers, that could be an option. Honestly there are so many free things you can do in Singapore with friends. Even though I know I can spend $20-30 on overpriced eggs and sitting on my ass for two-three hours talking to friends, I get alot more satisfaction having some kick-ass teh halia for $1.50 at the local hawker, and then go for a stroll with friends along the Marina Bay route!I am a millenial and I am cognizant of how peers might like to go to 'nice' (read: atas) places on the weekends, take a bunch of pretty photos on cafe hopping adventures and spend upwards of $30-40 in a day. Of course, to each their own - but if you are looking to save money, then you would need to think about cheaper options along the way!1 comment3"

It will really save you a lot of money than buying outside or using Grab delivery.2)When you hang out with your friends, you don‘t have to go to expensive places!3)Shop only when you need it not want to buy it. You can do window shopping!4)Get an investment account. Allocate your money well. At the end of the day, you control what you spend. Don’t get influence by your friends to purchase impulsively!0 comments0"
