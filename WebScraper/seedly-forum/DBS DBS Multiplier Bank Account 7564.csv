question,DBS DBS Multiplier Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Jul 2018How does the calculation of interest work with DBS Multiplier? Does the balance from the other DBS savings account included?I have a POSB Savings and DBS Multiplier; and wondering if the amount in POSB Savings will earn the 1.85% interest as well. I use the POSB Savings as a spending account and hope to transfer monthly budget (few thousands) into it but am afraid it will lose the 1.85% interest3 answersAnswerBump0

WizardAnswered on 23 Sep 2018No. POSB and DBS accounts all works separately as indepedence.DBSM (DBS Multiiplier) accounts interest were only given for the $ save in the DBSM a/c, not including any other a/c and those other a/c will have their own interest. ​So to earn the 1.85%, transfer all you savings / $ into the DBSM a/c.​See DBSM account T&C: https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/deposits/multiplier-programme/DBS%20Multiplier%20Programme_FAQ.pdf​Interest calculation is at page 8, section C in the T&C above. ​On the other hand, I also recommend to read up this hack between POSB Cash Back bonus saver + CIMB Fast saver 1% hack shared by Seedly  members.

An alternative would be to use a spreadsheet to keep track of how much you can spend0 comments0"

However, salary need not be credited to Multiplier account. You can credit your salary to any DBS/POSB account will do. 0 comments0"
