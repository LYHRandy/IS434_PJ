1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dear Anonymous and JohnThank you for the question. Just to clarify on what Samuel from Endowus have shared regarding the use of 2 equity funds that MoneyOwl uses versus the 1 fund that Endowus uses.The 2 funds MoneyOwl uses (the Global Core Equity Fund and the EM Large Cap Core Equity Fund) has a combined total expense ratio (TER) of 0.37-0.38%, as compared to the 0.43% of the World Equity Fund used by Endowus. Also, the 2 funds that MoneyOwl uses track the MSCI World and the MSCI EM respectively, and are a cost effective way of getting diversified equity exposure. Our 88%12% Global/EM split reflects the MSCI All Country World Index, which is typically used to represent World Equity exposure.This is not to say that the DFA World Equity Fund used by Endowus is of lesser quality than the one that MoneyOwl uses. We believe that all 3 funds can give investors a good investment experience at a cost that is efficient. We just wanted to clarify that it is not true that the World Equity Fund used by Endowus relative to the 2 funds MoneyOwl uses is the most cost effective way in implementation from Dimensional. At the end of the day, it is how each company wants to execute the asset allocation for their clients in the best way where they think it will give them the best investment outcome after taking cost into consideration.  In this regard, both Endowus and MoneyOwl use funds that are considerably lower than what is offered elsewhere.With regard to Fixed Income, MoneyOwl’s philosophy is that the fixed income portion of the portfolio is used for diversification across asset classes and for its negative correlation to equities, effectively acting as a buffer to the equity component in a portfolio during times of volatility. As such, we focus on high investment grade (A and above) bonds that are stable and are fully hedged to SGD so that the returns are not eroded by unfavourable currency movements. The fund has a TER of 0.29% and does not have emerging market bond exposure, but instead has a well-diversified portfolio of about 180 issues (bonds) across 16 countries that make up a large part of the global bond market. It is designed to be part of a total return portfolio to capture and improve expected returns from both yields and capital gains based on information readily observable in bond prices today, without having to forecast what may happen to yield curves around the world in the future. Our goal is for fixed income to provide a high level of portfolio stability during times of market stress to allow our clients to remain invested in their portfolios to capture long term equity returns.In addition, I would like to clarify that iFAST does not own Providend contrary to what was mentioned by Samuel from Endowus. While it is true that iFAST is a corporate shareholder of Providend, Providend is majority owned by individual shareholders and most of them are employee shareholders of which I am the biggest individual shareholder of Providend. And although iFAST is a corporate shareholder of Providend we are not obliged to use them. Our corporate governance would not allow that. In fact, we had relationship with Navigator and also currently have a relationship with another platform, FAME by Philip Securities. We are also free to use other platforms such as Havenport, Saxo and the like. Some of these platforms have approached us and we have also approached some of them before. But having spend the last 2 decades working with various platforms, and having managed end consumers' money through various crises especially the GFC in 2008, we have come to realise that besides cost, factors such as quality of platform, especially in terms of client service, accuracy in reporting and experience serving large number of advisory clients are very important, especially when markets become difficult. While we try to keep cost efficient. We are mindful that we need to balance it with having a safe, secure and experienced platform/custodian as that is the place where we ""store"" our clients' hard earned money. As MoneyOwl's asset under management becomes bigger, we will always try to bring this custodian and platform cost down for our clients.In my personal opinion, both MoneyOwl and Endowus are good companies that investors can trust. Both companies serve clients with different needs and preferences. Both companies try to be as cost efficient as possible for our clients and to do the right thing. Ultimately, investors should decide who to use to build wealth based on which company can better serve their needs. I would be happy if Singaporeans use either Endowus or MoneyOwl to build their wealth. I think their money is in good hands.4 comments17"
2,"See all 4 comments Chuin Ting Weber25 May 2019MoneyOwl is an NTUC social enterprise and a Joint Venture between NTUC Enterprise and Providend. As part of a well-established corporate group, we adhere to high governance standards, which are also required by the MAS of regulated entities. Even if you were right, Sam, that iFast owned Providend, which it does not, it would be unthinkable of Providend (given its reputation for strong ethics for decades)  to pressurise MoneyOwl to choose iFast for any other reasons than the most objective and in our client's interests. Equally, it is absolutely unthinkable that MoneyOwl would give in in any such hypothetical scenario to agree to compromise our clients' interests through preferential treatment to any third company because of a shareholder relationship. Even a 100% shareholder cannot require its subsidiary to do things against client and company interests-- this is basi... (more)Question Poster25 May 2019Great clarifications. Agree with MoneyOwl's justification on the usage of 2 funds with the lowest TER, though it is ironically higher in total fees to consumer. If Endowus could allow consumers to have those 2 funds in our portfolios, it will be a true win for consumers. :)"
3,"Harry Chng, Cfo And Svp, Investment at MoneyowlLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Anonymous,Thanks for your question. At MoneyOwl, our fees range from 1.15%-1.21% p.a., depending on your portfolio. This includes 0.65% p.a. advisory fee, 0.18% p.a. platform fee, and between 0.32%-0.38% p.a. for the fund expense ratio. You can learn more about our fees here: https://advice.moneyowl.com.sg/the-right-portfolios/#our-fees EndowUs has a tiered fee structure, so for amounts $200k and below, the all in access fee is 0.6% p.a., however for a like-to-like comparison with MoneyOwl, you should also include their Fund level fees (total expense ratio) which is stated as 0.50%-0.56% p.a. This gives a fee range of 1.10%-1.16% p.a., which is not too far off from MoneyOwl. We may not be the lowest-cost adviser - we do not aim to be so, and in fact the lowest cost option is DIY investing. Rather we aim to keep costs low enough to give investors a good return on their investments, while adding value through advice. Our advice is firstly, bionic, i.e., not just digital/robo but also human, and we have a team of advisers who can help clients especially through risk coaching to stay invested when times are turbulent. Our advice is also not just on investment, but comprehensive - we already have insurance and will-writing and soon we will integrate CPF planning in our comprehensive planning offering. Finally, we are confident to bring our services to our clients not just because we believe we have the right investment philosophy and process to deliver results to our clients, we also have the right people and resources behind the technology — as a JV between NTUC Enterprise and Providend, we bring a unique combination of mission for the ordinary man in the street and long-standing expertise in financial advisory, to journey with you into the long term.We are doing an investment symposium on 25th May morning and you might be interested to attend. You can sign up at link below and look forward to seeing you there: https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/moneyowl-investment-symposium-registration-60702740531Hope this helps!1 comment13"
4,Samuel Rhee25 May 2019Harry just to clarify that Endowus fund level fees are 0.43%-0.55% and thus the total fee range is 1.03%-1.15% for Endowus vs 1.15~1.21% for Moneyowl. Almost the same! This is because the World Equities Fund level fees have come down from 50bps last year to 43bps this year as a result of greater scale and cost-efficiency which is being passed on to our clients. This is why Endowus and Moneyowl love to use Dimensional as they are completely aligned with our values in returning as much to the clients as possible. Thank you!
5,"Sin Ting So, Head Of Client Experience at EndowusLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hello! I just wanted to elaborate on some of our fees below. We agree with Harry that you should look at the all-in costs when you are thinking about fees. Our fees can be separated into (1) Access Fee, (2) Fund-Level Fee(1) Access Fee: paid to Endowus for investment advice, portfolio creation and rebalancing, brokerage, and transfers. Access Fee per annum based on assets under advice (AUA):
0.60%   S$200,000 and below
0.50%   S$200,001 to S$1,000,000
0.35%   S$1,000,001 to S$5,000,000
0.25%   S$5,000,001 and above(2) Fund-Level Fee (fund total expense ratio): charged by the fund manager out of the underlying fund Net Asset Value (NAV). Fees range between 0.43% to 0.55% per annum depending on your portfolio. The fund-level fee is similar to expense ratio of ETFs.4 comments10"

7,"Samuel Rhee, Chief Investment Officer at EndowusLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 25 May 2019Hi Anonymous & John Doe,Just to clarify a few things on top of Harry and Sin Ting's comments, the fund level fees are not determined by us but the fund manager such as Dimensional and PIMCO. Both Moneyowl and Endowus share the philosophies of investing through Dimensional products that have broad market exposures but are tilted towards the proven factors of returns. The only minor difference is that in building the portfolio, Moneyowl chose to use 2 Dimensional funds. 1 Developed Market and 1 Emerging Market funds. Whereas Endowus use the single World Equity Fund. There is a lot of overlap between the two equities portfolios and Moneyowl's equities portfolio has in absolute terms a slightly lower fee structure where as the World Equities Fund is slightly higher because it gives exposure to a more broader global market exposure. To clarify, the World Equities fund is the most cost efficient implementation of the diversified total global market exposure that Dimensional implements in a single fund.On fixed income we will agree to disagree on this as Moneyowl uses once again a Dimensional fund. The Short Fixed Income fund, which exposes itself to the factors in fixed income such as Term, Credit and Yield which are great. We agree with Moneyowl's views that diversification is an important and key determinant of allocating to a fixed income portfolio. However, we are also cognisant of the fact that some investors prefer to invest in a 100% bond portfolio or a heavily bond biased portfolio and in such a case, we feel that the PIMCO portfolios provide a better risk-adjusted return and yield enhancement compared to the other offerings in Singapore especially at the lowest cost we can access them. We completely respect Moneyowl's views on the diversification benefits which the Dimensional Short Fixed Income fund offers the portfolio.Finally, so the bottom line is that whereas the platform fees are slightly lower at Endowus, the fund-level fees are slightly higher for Endowus vs Moneyowl. Net net, we do not feel that there is a meaningful difference between us in terms of the actual total fees. 1.06-1.15% at Endowus (Harry - you used the old numbers!) vs 1.15%-1.21% for Moneyowl. Both are extremely low and cost-efficient especially compared to other channels of access. We just have slightly different portfolios and slightly different composition in the make up of the fees that's all.What is more important to know is that we both work with partners like Dimensional who will continue to bring down the fees as scale economies allows them the room to cut their fees which we will pass on to you immediately. For example the World Equities Fund was 50bps in fees last year but it has come down to 43bps this year as it improves scale and efficiency. And we hope it keeps coming down as it directly drops to your bottom line. Less cost just means higher returns for you. These are some of the benefits of working with great partners like Dimensional. Endowus and Moneyowl are both also working hard to increase and improve our product and service offerings so we would love for you to keep watching out for the value added services both firms are working hard to provide to the benefit of individual investors in Singapore.Hope this helps to clarify more. Thank you!Sam0 comments4"
