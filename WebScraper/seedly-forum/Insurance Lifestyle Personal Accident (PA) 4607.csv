question,Insurance Lifestyle Personal Accident (PA) Asked by RxAsked 3w agoIs it worth it to subscribe to AIA Vitality?I bought a basic Personal Accident insurance with AIA and added on AIA vitality membership which cost me a total of about $32 per month. Iâ€™m getting back $20 per month in terms of vouchers ($5 per week). Do you guys think itâ€™s worth it or itâ€™s just a marketing scheme to allow the agent to sell you more plans in the future?1 answerAnswerBump0

ProdigyAnswered 2w agoPersonally speaking, it's a programme designed to keep you on track for your fitness and keeps you accountable for your health.How it does that is through awarding you points for health checkups, vaccination shots, fitness workshops, and buying of healthy food. Not to mention additional benefits like weekly vouchers, premium discounts on Vitality integrated policies, and even cash back on Emirates tickets of up to 50%.Whether your agent upsells you or not should depend on your current needs and requirements through comprehensive financial planning. So just focus on the benefits and enjoy your health while you're still young and active! Have fun with the programme.If there's a need to upgrade plans, let the agent advice and consider whether you do need to take it up or not. No one should force you to do anything you don't want to ðŸ™‚0 comments2"
