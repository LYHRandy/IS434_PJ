Try this, invest your money and don't look at it until next year. Absolutely no looking at all. You're investing for the long term, not for a few days.Gabriel Tham22 May 2019Markets go up and down. If you are so worried about the down, then perhaps this investment vehicle is not for you. Maybe a lower risk one like Singapore savings bond is more suited."

Then when you deposit back you lose on exchange fees from sgd to usd. You might be better off investing in forex if you can time and withdrawal and deposit right. 2) if you withdraw your ""earnings"" in the short term, then you are defeating the purpose of compound effect of having your earnings reinvested for longer term gains. This is a long term savings plan and if you notice the predicted chart for your portfolio, the bulk of the gains will be at the latter years where your gains over the years are compounded to greater effect.0 comments2"
