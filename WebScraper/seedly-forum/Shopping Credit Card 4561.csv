1,"Dexter Tiah, Founder at Whatcard.sgLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 20 Jun 2019Depending on whether you can hit the minimum spending of the credit card, you can get from 1.5% (generic spend cashback) to 10% (boc family card, cimb platinum) in cashback. Ocbc titanium reward has the highest miles rewards at 4mpd.However, theres a lot of terms and conditions with these cards, so to simplify all these research, i suggest (shameless plug here) that you consider using www.whatcard.sg right before you transact at your merchant, just to double check you know?0 comments0"

For me personally, I'm a user of the OCBC365 Credit card.It offers between 3% (weekend) to 6% (weekday) cashback for the dining portion itself.So I suggest that this is a really fuss free kind of card for people like you which gives you cash rebates.I think you should use cashback cards vs miles cards for pure beginners as it's alot easier to understand for beginners.Hope this helps!
