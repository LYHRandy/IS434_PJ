RookieUpdated 5d agoHi!Real estate investment trusts (REIT) are a basket of securitised real estate assets and are considered to have shown strong returns over a period of time. A REIT exchange-traded fund (ETF), which holds baskets of these securities, offers a liquid, low-cost way to invest in the real estate asset class.Based on quality and assets under management (AUM) as of April 6, 2019, hereâ€™s a curated list of the top five real estate ETFsVanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ)Avg.

3,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019Hello! The three S-REITS ETFs are Lion Global S-REIT ETF, Phillip APAC SGX REIT ETF and Nikko AM Straits Trading Asia ex-Japan REIT ETF. Here is a quick chart comparing the three REITS ETF. As of Oct 2018, the 1-Year Returns (including distribution) areLion-Phillip S-REIT ETF: -0.30%Nikko AM Straits Trading Asia Ex-Japan REIT ETF: 0.75%Phillip SGX REIT ETF: -0.74% The dividend yields are: Lion-Phillip S-REIT ETF: 0.96%Nikko AM Straits Trading Asia Ex-Japan REIT ETF: 1.08%Phillip SGX REIT ETF: 5.01%S-REITS ETF are relatively young, listed only for 1-2 years, thus it is hard to determine which ETF will yield stable dividends. To determine which REITS ETF to invest in you could consider the diversification of the REITS ETF. For instance, Lion-Phillip only invest in Singapore-listed REITs whereas Nikko AM only has 60.5% of its portfolio listed in S-REITS. However, I would like to bring up the point of high recurring management fees. All 3 REITS ETF have recurring management fee, with Lion-Phillip and Nikko AM at approximately 0.5% per annum annualised. To put this into context, the popular S&P500 indexes and Vanguard's S&P500 ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.1% and 0.05% respectively. This management fees are in addition to the fees charged by the REIT manager. By investing in a REIT ETF, you not only have to pay fees to the REIT Manager, Property Manager and trustee at the REIT level but also the fund manager and the trustee again at the ETF level.0 comments1"
