1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Erm, not sure if i got you correctly at all. Are you trying to say that you require a revolving loan to pay a loan that you took?Hmm, you can try to take a policy loan for one of your life policies (if you have any) as the interest rate is lower than a normal loan.But seriously, are you facing some situation that you require to pay a loan with another loan?4 comments0"
