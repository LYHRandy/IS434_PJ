1,"Jonathan NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Mar 2019I think that buying a car is definitely not an investment vehicle! It is actually a depreciating asset where it loses value rapidly over time. In fact, there is very little chance that automobiles will appreciate in value.Singapore is one of the most expensive places in the world to own a car, with COE costing $26,309 (Up to 1600cc cars) and $36,961(Above 1600cc cars) this month. The final average price tag of a car is actually more $110,000. We must also not neglect the necesssary expenditures after owning a car. These include road tax, car insurance, parking and ERP charges, petrol and car servicing costs.  Moreover, it maybe cheaper to take a Grab than owning a car!!
