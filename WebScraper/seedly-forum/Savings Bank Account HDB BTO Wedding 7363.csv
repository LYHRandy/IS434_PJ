1,"Josh NgLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 06 Jul 2019I think a good way to anchor this question on is to keep a checklist of items you need to get for key milestones (BTO, wedding, honeymoon etc.)An example for wedding would be what you need on the actual day (venue, decorator, wedding bands, flowers etc.) From there, you can see if there is a better deal from getting packages vs. single engagement from boutique firms. I think what most married couples will tell you is to have a rough plan and tentative budget, and work within it. The truth is you can do a lot with planning and executing so it is important to discuss what is essential for the both of you (which cannot be compromised) and what are nice to have (but can be given up due to budget constraints) such as having a music band at your wedding, installing zip trek for your balcony etc.Good luck!0 comments3"
