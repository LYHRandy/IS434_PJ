It's one thing to take care of your own finances, and another to take care of joint expenses (and this includes extended family say in-laws etc). For example, I have seen disagreements where recently married couples cannot agree on how much they should give their respective parents etc. BudgetReally examine what the expenses are to live together. Utilities, food, transport etc. Clearly, it will be even more with children. Understand how much it will be, so as to minimize surprises in the future. Both parents might even have different perspectives on what is deemed 'essential' for a child. One parent might think that chinese tuition classes at $200 a month is absolutely critical, whereas the other might not. More incomeLook at side jobs, and take on projects that leverage your own skillsets. P.S. I would probably not spend so much on a wedding, but that's my personal take.0 comments1"

Know yourself and determine what are some of the options you'll be willing to explore; but generates passive income.If you are planning to have kids all the expenses can add up quickly, explore sustainable options such as reusable nappies (from cutting expenses point of view), to early investment (robo adviser maybe?) or if you're more conservative, a good deposit account to fight the inflation.A good idea is to talk to each other, know your financial commitments and work from there to see what each of you can contribute.0 comments0"
