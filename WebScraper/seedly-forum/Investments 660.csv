question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Aug 2019Am having a hard time choosing between IBKR and IG Markets for investing (DCA) into ETFs. Has anyone tried both and what are the pros and cons of each?IG Markets seemed easier to set up as they just take info from SIngpass, IBKR seemed a bit longer in terms of onboarding. Haven't gotten around to funding either account yet though!1 answerAnswerBump0"
