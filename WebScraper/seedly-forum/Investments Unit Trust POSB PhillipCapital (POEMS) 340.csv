question,"Investments Unit Trust POSB PhillipCapital (POEMS) Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoWhat are the fees associated with DBS UT transfer out to Poems?I currently have some Unit Trust funds that I have bought via DBS. I enrolled via the RSP program to fulfil the POSB Cashback criteria. I also have a Poems account which I do RSP, with the end of 12 consecutive months of RSP. It will no longer fulfil the criteria of POSB Cashback. I want to consolidate the investment in Poems. Does anyone know any fees associated with it? And also, how can I go about doing it?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1) POEMS also carries the fund (else you can't transfer it in)2) The relevant paperwork is signed off (depends on the fund source, fund house)Just be aware that the transfer in the process would 'freeze' your UTs and you would not be able to transact in them until they are reflected in POEMS.You can drop me a message if you would like to know more about the process, timeframe, etc.0 comments3"
