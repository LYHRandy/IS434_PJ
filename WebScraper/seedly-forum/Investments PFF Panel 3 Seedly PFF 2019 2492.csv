1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Hello there,Just want to use the simple idea of ""support"" and ""resistance"" as well as a simple illustration to answer your question!Lets look at the share price of Exelixis Inc. (EXEL), listed on the NASDAQ as an example:In layman term, think of a stock price movement like the motion of breathing. One has to inhale, take a deep breath; exhale, removing the air in your system before inhaling again. In a sense, that can be said for stock price movement as well! They have to increase gradually, decrease slightly, and increasing again - in short, the long term stock price rises as the price makes higher highs, and higher lows - as seen in the diagram above.One easy way (not exclusive or by no means is this completely true) is to draw a ""trendline"", to roughly determine where the next lowest point, or highest point will be at. If you are bullish on this stock, your goal is to enter/buy this stock when it is at its 'new low' ie: I should buy EXEL on 10th Nov and 24th DecThis is just a general guide but i hope this helps in helping you get a rough sense of how you know when is a high/low of the company share price.0 comments1"
