question,"Investments AMA SG Young Investment Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Sep 2018How should I plan my retirement if I am self-employed, with an annual income of $150k?I am a self employed in my 30s, with annual income of $150k. I have been topping up my CPF to save up for retirement up to the max voluntary limits. And also maxing out my SRS yearly. I also have insurance and investment plans. What else should I look out for? Given that CPF rules can change every year. Is it advisable to rely on CPF for retirement, since as a self employed I can invest in other vehicles? I am partly doing it for the tax deductibles.4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If I may add.1) Keep 6 months of your monthly income as an emergency fund. This can be in a high interest savings account or SSB, but the point is pure liquidity.2) You have an investment horizon of about 30 years till retirement. You should be investing most of your money and looking to grow it at 6-10% per annum. Calculate your existing asset allocation growth %.3) You can start investing your CPF and SRS monies into globally diversified funds with a 70% equity and 30% fixed income split. Adjust your fixed income percentage with your age every 10 years or so.4) Invest excess cash after your CPF and SRS contributions into a similar portfolio.5) When you start hitting your 40s, move some of your money into guaranteed sources of income that pays out coupons or dividends like annuities or REITS.6) If you're self employed, your income may or may not be consistent, make sure you protect your downside as well with enough income disability insurance (70% of monthly salary), and Critical Illness insurance (3-5 X Annual Income).1 comment2"
2,"Angela Lau12 Sep 2018Thanks for your reply. I think it is very insightful ;) Where should I invest my money to get 6-10% returns? Actually I intend to retire in 15-20 years time, thus I would like to explore Reits and Options trading but have not started. I currently put some of my emergency fund into the new Nikki AM Corporate Bonds ETF and SSB. Should my emergency funds be only pure cash? Can I invest 40% of my emergency cash into this ETF? "
3,"Conor GanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 02 Nov 2018Hi it is great that you are contributing to CPF as its a good source for self employed people to secure a source of income upon reitrement. To add on to Hariz's comment, i agree with how you should keep 6months of your monthly income as emerngency savings especially as a self employed. Try your best to keep it in a high interest savings account as you will need the liquidity when in the time of need.Looking at the imput and the comments on the post, You could have your insurance and investment plans re-viewed every year. I myself review my investing clients every 6months-1year for I myself am invested in the platform in which my clients to ride the wave. Currently doing an average of 7.78% PA highest being 15.6% (depending on the time of entry).At the same time, you would need to access your risk along with your age as we grow into the later stages, we should be focusing more on sustainability then the growth of assets. Always rebalance your portfolio as and when needed to ensure your risk profile fits your life stage.Before you look into any investment vehicle, do make sure it is credible, the person you are or will be investing with knows their deed and you are able to entrust them in growing your money with them. :)0 comments1"

You should explore investing in stocks or Singapore savings bond. Its better than leaving your money in the bank account. 0 comments0"
