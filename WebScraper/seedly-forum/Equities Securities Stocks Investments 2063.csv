1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Mar 2019Personally I like to listen to Mr Aswath Damodaran's youtube channel. He is a highly accredited corporate finance professor who has written alot of books and other academic materials regarding valuations, and many people use his theories and formulas as benchmarks of the real world market.His youtube channel mainly focuses on going through the methods which he uses to value stocks and companies, and he really goes through his thought process of how he creates assumptions and why he thinks it will happen as such. I feel it is a great place for someone like you who want to understand more about analysis on stock better, and in fact further hone your own valuation skills so that you can become your own analyst.If not, a website to see what analysts have to say about SGX stocks is at sginvestors.io, which also provides huge amounts of data, analyst reports and opinion articles of the stocks that make up SGX. I feel it is one of the places that if you don't actually have access to bloomberg/thomson Reuters/ Factset, is an extremely good place to head to get info on our own home stocks. You can download the analyst reports there also, so its really helpful to see what JP Morgan/OCBC/Phillip Capital investors have to say regarding your target stock!If you are still in university, head over to your business school. I'm sure they have Bloomberg Terminals, Thomson Reuters that you can access as a student for free, as a academic. These financial platforms are the google of your financial reports, and provide you with so much information regarding the stock of your choice, from Financial statements, to the nitty gritty of who are their suppliers, their customers, and their market share.0 comments0"
