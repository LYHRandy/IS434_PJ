1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Mar 2019Yeah heard about them long ago.. This is good when the S&P500 goes up. But when down? Your returns goes down the other way by 3x.There are also inverse etfs that do exactly the opposite i.e price goes up when S&P500 drops and vice versa.Why not just use plain vanilla options instead?0 comments0"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Mar 2019Levered ETFs- ETFs which comprise of derivatives to increase exposure to underlying tracked index. Pretty interesting idea in my opinion- but I think investors need to be aware this carries much higher exposure and therefore market risk.
Just read a pretty interesting article over in mid 2017 when the SEC went back against approving an ETF set to replicate over 4x of the S&P index. Quite a good move considering newer ETFs as such were just going to get increasing levered which would ultimately hit people harder during a recession. However I am certainly curious whether such ETFs are present and regulated on other stock exchanges, especially in less regulated emerging marketsâ€¦0 comments0"
