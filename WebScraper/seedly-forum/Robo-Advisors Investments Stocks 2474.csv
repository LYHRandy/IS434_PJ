1,Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019I think this recent article shocked many. One would think that machines following emotionless algorithms would be able to outperform human judgement with emotions mixed within. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-01/one-of-wall-street-s-most-popular-trading-strategies-is-now-failingI think this really goes against the tide of what algo trading have been pitching and really shows that Machines at least at this moment- might not posess the capabilities or dataset to consistently outperform humans in making decisions.0 comments1
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Similar to Leonard, I also came across another article regarding this also. In essence, it disagrees that humans will be disadvantaged because we still have a value-add that these machinese don't. (https://news.efinancialcareers.com/sg-en/293432/human-traders-aim-to-prove-their-superiority-to-trading-algos-in-calm-markets)For example, the article says that algorithims and quants will struggle when the market isn't volatile, since they are better at high-frequency trading, and need steps to recognise if the market is going sideways or calm. Human traders would be better at recognising these signs and the signs that they represent. Humans can also rely on their intuition. You probably also need humans to negotiate block trades, which machines really can't. Humans are also much probably better at setting benchmarks for their trading strategy. Another article from the financial times also disagreed. Mainly on the points that machines don't know the true intrinsic value of a share, and that they rely on historical trends and may not be able to react to new occurances. Machines are also created by humans plus their trading strategies may erode each other out over time.0 comments0"
3,"Terence Tan, Finance at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 04 Mar 2019I have a fundamental scorecard website (https://www.fundamentalscorecard.com/) - It uses criterias to show if a company is undervalued or is a growth stock or has a moat.This reduces my bias when I look at a company and let numbers do the talking.However, at times, you will see companies, such as S-Chips, which are less desirable getting on top of the scorecard ranking. That is where you will still need human intervention to stop yourself to invest in these less desirable companies.On the other hand, less desirable does not mean you will not make money. Probably less desirable from an investment strategy standpoint.0 comments0"
4,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Yes and no. AI can do learning, can give insights. Some even now can compose music and create arts. However, AI cannot manage human conflicts, works well with counselling and manage things that requires human factors. In short, I believe God didn't create human then allow AI to take over human, AI at most is still helping human on any thing that can quantify, calculate and factors in some possiblities (against maths).  Anything beyond that, AI won't go beyond human. I always believe, the creations will never go beyond the creator in every areas, might be better in parts but never all.0 comments0"
