Sorry, I'm a total noob at this..Nicholas Chan29 Sep 2018Yes u can't buy while it is halted. If u see the price it just resumed trading yesterday. The price jumped to even higher than the offer price. "
3,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018You could only gain if you are currently holding the stock unless there is really no point to buy now. 0 comments0
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019How much can you stand to gain if you try to enter after the trading halt is lifted? Market will have raised the stock price to the offer price immediately once trading resumes. Possible way to gain is if you are already holding on to the stock before this announcement. 1 comment0"

7,"Question Poster27 Sep 2018But wouldn’t the price go up to match the acquisition offer price?Yong Kah Hwee28 Sep 2018Oh right, didn't read about the news. But I think it'd have been too late to buy after trading resumes! "
8,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I don't think so. I agree with Financial Horse. SG market is way too saturated and only Singtel is diversity enough , plus more international exposure rather than just SG focus. We're too small. ​Let's read this review: https://financialhorse.com/m1/within has review of also Singtel: https://financialhorse.com/singtel/ and Starhub: https://financialhorse.com/starhub/​Go follow this post and see what other say at his FB: ​​​​​2 comments0"
9,"Question Poster27 Sep 2018But wouldn’t the price go up to match the acquisition offer price?HC Tang27 Sep 2018Can watch the discuss to see how other predict, one more discussion at Seedly also about this. Go see by Justin Guan.    My own thought is that in long term, it is still not a very good choice compare to other tech stock that has more potential or the blue chips that is more diversify and not limit their biz only to SG only.
