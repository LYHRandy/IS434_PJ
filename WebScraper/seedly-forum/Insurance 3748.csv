1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 08 Jul 2019Some general guidelines:1) Hospitalization plan - for hospital expenses
2) Critical illness coverage - rule of thumb is usually 5 times your income, or a baseline for alternative treatment plus five years of expenses
3) Death cover - Ten times your annual income or based on your existing liabilities (e.g. are you supporting your parents?) If you have no liabilities then this is not strictly necessary.
4) Personal accident - for all the unexpected happenings
5) Disability insurance - A nice to have, this is for income replacement in the event you are unable to perform your current jobOnce that is settled, look at setting aside your funds for retirement via annuities/investments.0 comments3"

GeniusAnswered on 09 Jul 2019Hospitaliisation coverage - Integrated Shield PlanDeath/Total and Permanent Disability Coverage/ Terminal Illness Coverage - You should be looking at about 5 to 10 x of your annual income. It depends on how much liabilities you have too. Someone who has dependents and mortgage liabilities will need a higher insurance amount than someone who does not have these liabilities.Critical Illness coverage. Make sure to get a plan that covers early critical illness coverage. You should be looking at about 3 to 5 times of your annual income.Personal accident plan - I think this depends on your lifestyle and job scope. If you are holding a deskbound job, you can get a simple accident plan that cost less than $100 a year.
That will be all for your insurance coverage.0 comments2"
