1,"Ashley Wong, Financial Assistant at Multi Management & Future SolutionsLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 25 Feb 2019I would rather not invest in tech stocks as I find it risky for most investors. One of the major reasons for the same is failing to understand the technology industry. Also, with all the latest developments in technology industry, competetion is also growing like anything. Companies failing to match this competetion are likely to be doomed which really makes it difficult for people to predict which company will thrive and which won't thus making investment a difficult thing to consider. 0 comments0"
