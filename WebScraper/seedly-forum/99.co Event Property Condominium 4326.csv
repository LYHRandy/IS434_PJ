WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi, Douglas here. 2nd Key note speaker.From my personal experience as well as the clients I serve, a 2 bedder has the highest rental appeal as it appeals to both small families, and singles who dun mind sharing or a single who wants an extra room for visiting friends and family.​​​
