3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 31 Jul 2019TL;DR The firm has weak financials and poor valuation. This is probably due to Synagie still being in the early growth stage phase. Without a very compelling growth story, I would not bother with investing here at all.Source: Aspire Shares InvestmentBusiness ProfileSynagie provides e-commerce solutions in Southeast Asia (‚ÄúSE Asia‚Äù) in the Body, Beauty and Baby sector. They help Brand Partners to execute their e-commerce strategies by selling their goods or services to consumers online. They do this by providing one-stop services and integrated technology to manage their multi-channel e-commerce operations.Source: The Straits TimesIncome StatementFor 2018 itself, the profitability is quite low, where earnings were negative. These margins have seemed to worsen since 2017 as well, painting quite a bleak picture for the firm. Despite an increase in revenue, earnings have largely decreased as well.Balance SheetAll in all, the balance sheet of the firm looks pretty healthy, with fairly good liquidity ratios as well as no debt to pay off. Furthermore, these ratios have improved since 2017. In short, the balance sheet is strong.Free Cashflow AnalysisFor 2018 itself, free cash flow looks rather bleak, as it was negative. Moreover, free cash flow has also reduced over time. This is quite an unhealthy sign too. This was caused by a decrease in earnings as well as an increase in capital expenditures. Working capital management had improved, however, which helped to improve cashflows. The firm did not pay any dividends, most likely because of the weak cash flows of the firm.Efficiency MetricsThe firms are very inefficient in their use of assets, and needless to say, this is a very bad sign overall. Their very weak ROE is caused not only by weak earnings but also by a low equity multiplier.ValuationThe shares of the firm are trading at very low multiples. However, this could be due to the very weak companion variables which accompany these multiples. Hence, I wouldn't bet that the shares of the firm are undervalued at all.Cost of CapitalAs the firm does not hold any debt, there is no cost of debt associated with the firm. Without an estimated beta, it would be quite hard to determine the cost of equity for this instance. Regardless of the WACC, even if we give Beta a value of 0,1, it would be much higher than the ROIC because earnings are negative. This suggests that the firm is destroying value for shareholders.1 comment3"
