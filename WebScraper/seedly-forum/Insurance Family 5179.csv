question,"Insurance Family Asked by AnonymousAsked 4w agoShould I get the Great Eastern - Great Family Care?I am a single child and my parents are 68 with basic Eldershield and hospitalisation plan. Am planning to get this plan as a safety net to cover my parents.Was recommended to get GFC X 4 (50K) coverage for me (53 CI) and 4 x parent rider (15k) for them to cover Cancer, Alzheimer, Parkinson and Dementia. Premiums will be $253 x 4 & $304 x 4 respectively annually. Reason for 4 policies is to enable flexibility when claiming for either parent in future. Is this a wise move? Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump1"
