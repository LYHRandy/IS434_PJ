Investing in POSB invest saver, will take your money to invest in stocks and bonds which may be volatile in the near future. Therefore, you may want to consider sticking with the SSB option.1 comment1"

WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you have need for the money in 4 years time (considered a short time frame), then it is best to continue with your Singapore savings bonds.The products in the RSS are typically ETFs or unit trusts, which can swing up or down in value. You might make a big gain in 4 years time or you could be in the red in 4 years time.The safest choice is still SSB for a short time frame.1 comment0"
