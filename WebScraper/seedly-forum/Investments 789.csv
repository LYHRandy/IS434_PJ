1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 10 Jul 2019Firstly the ILP is just a wrapper. You're investing in the funds your advisor chooses that is available on the platform and not the ""product"".The ILP charges you a sales charge and an annual fee for using their platform. They also give you bonuses if you commit for a long term and also along the way with loyalty bonuses. Currently it's one of the only ILPs that allows for dividends to be paid out if you choose such funds. But here's the thing - you have to stay committed. Any early termination is HEFTY.And the fees you pay is for the advice of your advisor, the constant monitoring of your portfolio to reach to your changing risk profile, rebalancing, and responses to market outlooks.If your advisor is not going to do all that, then you're paying for nothing. Because you can DIY the funds available for free. And even if let's say you want a broker to do all the above for you, you can do so with lesser fees than paying the ILP. I myself have a managed portfolio and charge lesser than the ILP. I can't give you bonus units, but you're not commited to any long term plan. Your funds are not locked up and you can choose to invest and not invest anytime you want. So even though the product is not bad, you can get similar access to funds without a long term commitment with lesser fees, with the same advice.2 comments5"
2,"Hariz Arthur Maloy10 Apr 2019My total portfolio fund charge are below 0.5%. This is paid to the fund managers in the portfolio. My annual advisory fee is 1% for the first 500k invested. There's a tier. I do not charge a sales charge for cash investments. This is negotiable if client also explores other business with me. This would be similar to some of the robo advisors available and even advisory firms like Providend.Hariz Arthur Maloy10 Apr 2019I use mainly Dimensional Fund Advisors. Their funds are low cost institutional class funds. They charge 0.3-0.5%. This is paid to the fund managers. The 1% is the advisory fee to me. I can work on a fee based model for investments. No sales charge. Stanley why not you email me, we take this conversation offline from seedly. :) Hariz.Maloy@promiseland.com.sg or message me on Facebook by searching my name."
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Is your agent the one to monitor the funds on your behalf and/or is competent on the funds selected or in general? FYI there are a LOT of funds available under Invest Ready, 50+ or more. So does your agent know the ins and outs of all these funds and is able to select the best ones based on your needs? Were the fees outlined to you and is the stated return net of all fees?If point 1 don't hold water you may be better off buying the funds outright via dollar dex or ifast. Less fees involved.Personally I won't touch ILPs due to uninspiring returns. Opinions stated above are personal and are not representative of any organisation I am part of.0 comments1"

Manulife InvestReady is a wealth/investment centric ILP. This is different from a traditional ILP, where it is a mix of protection and investment. That is, units are deducted to provide insurance coverage, and the cost of insurance increases as you get older.
Other similar products in this class are
Prudential's Pru Select Vantage
Manulife's InvestReady Wealth
AXA's Wealth Accelerate
It's basically a wrapper that's NOT meant for insurance purposes, even if they call it investment linked policy.
It has varying minimum investment period, which means if you terminate early, you will face a hefty charge. But the good news is that there is no upfront charges, and in fact, you get bonus units (For example, I believe you get 60% bonus units or $7200 for first year if you commit to $1k a month for 10 years)It has a wrapper charge, which is broken down into 0.7% + 1.8%, making a total of 2.5% per annum over the first 10 years, and subsequently 0.7% per annum, which is not too bad for a wrapper.It invests into unit trusts, including dividend paying ones, so you could technically receive dividends, even though you are not allowed to withdraw from the ILP.To me, if you are able to fulfil the investment quantum, and the time horizon, it actually makes sense. Reason is that the welcome bonus more than makes up for the annual charges, even if you invest directly into unit trusts. If you cannot hold for the minimum investment period, then it's best to invest directly into the unit trusts.0 comments0"

6,"See all 3 comments Alan Kor04 Apr 20191) High fees
2) Useless for insurance protection
3) Lousy returns

If you want to invest, just invest directly in the market or low cost options like ETFs.

If you want to insure yourself, get a no frills insurance protection only product which gives maximal protection coverage with minimal costs.Ng Kwok Fei04 Apr 2019Thanks Alan"
