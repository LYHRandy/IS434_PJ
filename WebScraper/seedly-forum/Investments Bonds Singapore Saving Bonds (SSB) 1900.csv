1,"Ernest Yeam Wee LeongLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Use age as a factor of percentage to put into bond.eg. age 25, 25% into bonds
age 40, 40% into bondsThe rationale is that as you grow older, it is ideal that the value of your investment does not fluctuate too much due to the need to use the money. By putting more money into bonds when you are much older, you are most likely to risk losing less of your money2 comments4"

3,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 201920% bond allocation for early 20s is alright. As you get older, you can increase the bond allocation. 30s, 30% bond, etc1 comment2"

GeniusAnswered on 08 May 2019In order to answer that question, you've to ask yourself, how much in emergency funds do you have, and how much are you willing to put in higher risk instruments.There's no definite answer to this, though many will tell you the % you should put in bonds should be equivalent to your age.0 comments1"
6,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 02 Jul 2019In my case, bonds and endowment plans was the only investment I had in my early 20s and know nothing about investment. As your knowledge get better and your confidence grows. (And you have more money) You will adjust accordingly.There’s a lack of information here. Is your 30% based on what you have now or your plan for what you plan to save for investment in the next few years. If it’s what you have now. Depending on the amount, might not be worth diversifying now. E.g for good bonds I personally will not subscribe less than $10K. (SSB except, cause I treat it like a high interest fix savings account.)Don’t be too fixated on the percentage, until you have a sensible pool of investments and need to balance out, maybe do a review of all your investment every half a year or annually. (Usually the percentages are based upon a fairly large sum of money, so might not be relevant to beginners who only have a small sum to start with) IMPORTANT. Don’t die die buy bonds because you need to put 30% in. Look for what is suitable. Similarly to your other 70%.(Ignore my comments if you are looking into funds and their proposed allocation. I am assuming you haven’t bought anything so your first purchase will actually be 100% of your portfolio minus savings, and I’m assuming you’re not given a huge pool of investment funds by your parents.)3 comments1"
7,"See all 3 comments Pat02 Jul 2019What are past examples of good bonds?Serene Toh02 Jul 2019DBS perp (still available but high entry level), Genting (over), the recent astrea IV and astrea V. Temasek bond & SIA, but feel their rates too Low. SSB is the safest, if you don’t like CPF but still want government backing. Basically you need to judge that the companies are strong enough pay the money back. They are borrowing to improve their cash flow, and not because they need the money to operate (eg Hyflux) Look for “a” ratings, good bonds typically will pay to get their bonds rated. The higher the rating the less likely it will default."
