God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Yes, what you're looking for is better risk adjusted return and diversification for capital preservation especially when you're closer to your retirement year as well. I'll also look at building up annuity payouts to form a baseline for retirement needs.0 comments0"
