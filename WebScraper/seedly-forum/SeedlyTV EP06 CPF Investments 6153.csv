1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Jun 2019It depends on what you're planning to invest into.2.5% for CPF OA is pretty decent. However, if you're using it to invest in an ILP or 'typical fund', you might even make a loss. SA has 4% interest (up to 5%) rate risk-free. This deal is very very very hard to beat and you should defintely not use the money there for investment.Index fund can normally outperform 2.5% annually, but you still have to look at the fund's past performance.Edit (Clarification): Funds in CPFIS have the potential to beat the minimum 2.5% interest given by CPF. However it is better to use cash since realistic interest rate achiveable by the high interest savings account is about 2.4%. Also, the bonus interest rate has cap limit and SDIC only protects up to $75,000.6 comments6"

- the first 20k in OA should earn 3.5% risk free interest, and you cant invest any amounts if balance is below 35k.

- if you have > 35k, do you intend to pay for your HDB or property with cpf?

The idea that it is very hard to beat is simply not true.

MasterUpdated on 13 Jun 2019The articles you read were during 2016 and earlier. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/most-members-in-cpf-investment-scheme-made-a-profit-in-2016https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/78-of-cpf-investors-made-returns-higher-than-oa-interest-rate-in-9255434Tomorrow I'll link you up with viable data that proves that your CPFIS funds are more than capable of beating OA, and even the STI ETF. For a three year return, 65 out of 84 funds in a higher risk category (which is appropriate for outperforming CPFIS) beat the OA. On iFast, out of close to 50 available funds almost all of them beat OA. These are all net of fees, and someone who says otherwise needs to show significantly higher evidence than speculation. You can invest in fund using your OA, amongst countless others that beat OA returns across a long time horizon - which you should have anyway. Do seek professional advice from an investment professional.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.543 comments1"

Do read up more and some interviews done with gurus instead of salesman.Luke Ho13 Jun 2019You realize that salespeople get their cues from the investment firms, right? 

Writing off an analysis based on source rather than facts is a pretty poor argument."
