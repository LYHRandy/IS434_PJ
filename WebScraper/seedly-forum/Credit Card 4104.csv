1,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Jun 2019Personally prefer cashback because I only travel once a year hahah and I don't mind paying for air tickets during sales. If you don't want to read too much into TnCs or to fulfil some bank's affiliation with an insurance company, I recommend the UOB One Card for cashback.-requirements: min $500 spending in one month with min 5 transactions (food, transport, insurance, shopping, utilities etc)-in the event that you are looking to purchase insurance and have a multiplier acc with some bank, I wouldn't suggest focusing too much on the cashback or step up in interest rates if you buy through the bank tbh... look at the policy and decide.For income tax, I believe most cards/banks exclude payments made to government organisations so I don't think you should focus too much on that!0 comments2"

Are you a frequent traveller and a miles collector?If you are a frequent traveller, miles would be good. If you are currently collecting miles elsewhere, then yes its better to add on with tax or insurance payment miles.If you are not a traveller or a current miles collector then stick with cashback.0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 20 Jun 2019You can check out this article from MoneySmart that helpfully lists all the credit cards that give rewards on insurance premium payments. The insurance exclusion clauses are usually buried deep in the T&Cs of the individual credit cards so checking each one yourself would take some time... https://blog.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/credit-cards-insurance-premiums-singapore/
Personally, I would go for miles (Amex Ascend for insurance) simply because with all my other spending I am also collecting miles. I prefer miles because it rewards me for both small as well as large lump sum spending and also do not mandate any minimum monthly spending0 comments0"
