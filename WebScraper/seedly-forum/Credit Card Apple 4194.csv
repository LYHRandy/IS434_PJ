1,"Huang Yixuan, Industrial Design at National University Of SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019When I first started using Apple Pay I was amazed at how seamless it was. That day I forgot to bring my wallet, but I realised I could go about my whole day because I'm able to pay with my phone! Especially with paywave becoming more and more popular, it's super convenient having Apple Pay in your phone. Also, you still get the same perks from the banks using any of your credit cards. It's even more seamless if you have an Apple Watch!0 comments0"
