God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoMost insurers offer various plans to cover CI, so you will want to consider what sort of plan you'd prefer. To help you understand the market better, I will share my own experience with my clients. From what I have been assisting clients with so far, the most commonly obtained type of plans are (in no particular order):1. Term plan (covering death/TPD) with a CI rider (Rider can be for late-stage CI, early-stage CI, multi-pay CI or a combination)Usually level premiums, which you pay for the duration of the planYour coverage is for the duration of the plan and will be a level amountOnce the plan ends, the cover stops. No claims mean no payout.Multi pay rider will allow recurring claimsNo cash value2. Pure CI plan (can be multi-pay or a single payout)Usually level premiums, which you pay for the duration of the planYour coverage is for the duration of the plan and will be a level amountOnce the plan ends, the cover stops. No claims mean no payout.Usually negligible death coverMay have a cash valueMulti pay rider will allow recurring claims3. Whole Life Limited Pay with CI Rider (Rider can be for late-stage CI, early-stage CI, multi-pay CI or a combination)Usually level premiums, which you pay a certain number of years (5,10,15,20,25 years)Your coverage is for life or till 99/100 and will be increased over time by the bonuses declaredOption to boost coverage during your prime working years with a 'multiplier'For plans that cover till 99/100, should you be blessed with longevity, the plan will mature and pay you the coverage amount + accumulated bonusesMulti pay rider if added will allow recurring claimsHas a cash valueOther less commonly purchased plans include, for example, CI plans that are aimed at helping people with pre-existing illnesses get coverage.Seek to understand what sort of plan may suit your requirement so that you know how you are covered and what amount of payout you will receive under various scenarios. Once you have an idea of what type of plan may suit your needs, then you can narrow the search to the insurers that have such plans, and do a comparison across that particular type of plan.Most insurers carry types 1,2 and 3, so you can get quite overloaded with the information available. Also, there may be still minor differences between the plans which will probably require an independent financial advisor who is well versed with the plans to explain the differences to you in order to help you come to a decision. For example, for Whole Life Plans with a multiplier, some insurers pay an inflation-adjusted payout, whereas some don't. Understanding these features may aid you to decide what kind of plan will suit you.0 comments10"

But let me break down a few factors:1) Stage of conditions covered.You can choose between Early to late-stage (ECI), or Late stage only (CI), or Multiple Claim CI (see article above).2) Conditions coveredOther than the 37 standardised definitions of CI, insurers can add more definitions, cap payouts for specific conditions, etc.
3) Length of coverDo you want to temporary cover for a few years to a few decades or whole life?4) Length of premiums paidThere are limited pay options which means you can pay off your insurance premiums after a few years and get coverage to continue after that.5) Inflation-adjusted coverage, or level coverDo you want more coverage every year, or the same amount throughout the policy?6) PremiumsCompare apple to apple plans and see if the premium provides a fair value for the sum assured and coverage length provided.7) Special BenefitsSome CI plans give you a free health checkup every 2 years, some give you some money back if there are no claims, etc.These are the 7 things you can look at to decide what CI plan may be the best fit.But because these can honestly be a bit confusing, you may want to speak to an Independent Financial Advisor that has access to a dozen or more insurers to compare and pick from to help you decide with which plan may be the most suitable.0 comments3"
3,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2w agoMost insurers follow standard definitions for critical illnesses set by LIA, but the 2019 Framework would only be available in products next year (see here).To shop for CI plan, you may like to look at the definitions of early-stage CI, which varies from one insurer to the other, and also any peripheral coverage that comes with the plan, e.g. diabetic complications, osteoporosis, which are not included in the CI listing. Pick the ones which offer the definitions that you can accept.You should also size up how much coverage you need, and then check lastly if the premiums are within your budget.0 comments0"
