1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Hi,I don't think there is something that can disrupt conventional investing but I think that the method will evolve over time. For instance, in the past US market can find many net-net stocks to invest but right now there are little of them. Hence, investors evolve their method looking at quality company instead of net-net company.0 comments1"
