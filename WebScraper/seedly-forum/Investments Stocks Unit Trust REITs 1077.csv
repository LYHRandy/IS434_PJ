If you are only buying it now, its too late.Next, you will receive a letter from them. It will state how many are you entitled to. The offering is 31 shares per 1000 of holdings.The document will state the ways you can apply for it. iBanking or ATM is the most convenient. For ibanking and atm you just key in the amount that you want to take up and pay from your bank account. You can apply for excess, which will also be deducted from your bank account.Only after the results will you know how much shares you are being allocated and the refunds.4 comments0"
