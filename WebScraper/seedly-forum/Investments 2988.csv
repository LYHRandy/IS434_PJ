question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Nov 2018I'm currently a student without much savings. Should I save the money until I have a sizeable capital, or bite the bullet and sign myself up for an online investment course which intake closes soon?As I do not have much capital to begin with, I might not be able to practise what I've learnt from the course, hence leading to my hesitation. Which should I choose?8 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Tiffany SQLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Save and study at the same time.. there r many cheap or free courses by sgx, dbs vickers, maybank kim eng, etc.. u can also start readying some investment books for starters(just Google it and u will have a list).. while learning..  save n plan your finances.. U also need to plan other things like insurance.. learn how to build a finance portfolio.. n most important enter the market correctly so that u will build up ur confidence in investment and not get urself burnt and have the fear of investing after that..1 comment3"

5,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Nov 2018You should save up first before beginning your investment journey and only invest with money that you can afford to lose. So basically, set aside some funds for spare or emergency use first before starting to invest. Also, as per what Yang Teng has shared, it is not necessary to enrol for investment courses as you can find lots of free content online to read up and build your knowledge. 0 comments1"

Personally, I find it unnecesary to go for courses which may or may not be helpful compared to saving which is definitely helpful.0 comments1"

9,"Terng Shing ChenLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 12 Nov 2018I submitted this on Quora and think it can help. There are many ways to save money in Singapore that applies to anyone. Some that I can think of, include:Eating at hawkers or foodcourts instead of restaurants. Healthy options are available if you look for them.Public transport is awesome, so use the MRT and familiarise yourself with the bus routes - at most you’ll spend 3–4 bucks a day.Healthcare is pricey, so look for affordable options like GetDoc Plus, which gives you discounts when you go to clinics for a dollar a month, and if you’re a student, it goes down to 50c a monthIf you like to party, do it at your dorm room or a friend’s house. Clubbing and drinking in Singapore is very expensive.Mobile data costs can be saved if you use the free wifi that almost every single building and cafe offers. Circle’s Life also offers affordable data packages.0 comments0"
