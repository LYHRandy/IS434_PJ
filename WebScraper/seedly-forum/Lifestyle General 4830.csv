WizardAnswered on 24 May 2019For most of my travels, I like to use Agoda's 'Book Now, Pay Later' - just so that I can make reservations for the hotel + room I want, but still have the flexibility to cancel it in the window where it's possible, just in case I find a better deal!0 comments1"
2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 May 2019I usually pay when I book the hotel, because prices are usually lower than if you were to pay upon check-in (at least on sites like agoda, booking.com, etc). However, if your trip is not confirmed at the time of booking, you may want to choose the option to pay only upon check-in!0 comments0"
