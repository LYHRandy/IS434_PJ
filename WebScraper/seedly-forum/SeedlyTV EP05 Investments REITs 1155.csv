1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Hi! I feel it's a question of how much revenue can one make from the plot of land. It's very similar to hotels, would you want a higher occupancy or a longer staying guest?But personally I would put WALE as priority because having a longer WALE = securing your occupancy for a longer period of time and I prefer security in my investments whereas even though a building has high occupancy but if tenants move elsewhere / bargain for cheaper rents then it would defeat the purpose as well0 comments0"
