1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019You can invest into this via some etfs that track the index. Most popular one is SPY, which is listed in the US. You don't need a cdp account if you are buying into SPY. Popular brokerages to use will include Td Ameritrade or interactive brokers. Do note that this will be subject to 30% withholding tax for dividends.0 comments0"
2,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hello! You can invest in S&P 500 with or without a CDP account. If you do not have a CDP account you can invest through a brokerage (custodian account). Some reputable brokerages are Saxo Capital Markets and Standard Chartered. For amounts less than $50,000 Saxo Capital provides the lowest comission. However, if you already have a CDP account, some CDP-linked brokerages are citibank, CIMB, Maybank, OCBC Securities, RHB securities and UOB Kay hian. Citibank has the lowest commission for amounts $50,000 and less.0 comments0"
