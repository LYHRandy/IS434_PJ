1,"Jerome OngLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 11 Sep 2019For DBS treasures it's 350k, similar to UOB privilege banking. Whereas OCBC premier & SCB priority is 200k. Usually, banks that are not very hard up for clients(DBS & OCBC) will give fewer benefits such as fewer airport lounges, no special gifts when buying Products, less sign up bonus when crediting the minimum sum.0 comments0"
