question,Investments Savings Mortgage Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 May 2019What do i do with all my remaining money and counters since MIP is closing?I'm pretty new to MIP and only started using it a month ago. Bought 1 counter with 100 dollars but now that it is closing. Should i hold or sell (which means that i will make a loss instead)? Will dividends be given if i continue holding?1 answerAnswerBump0
