1,"AYAndy YewLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 10 Jun 2019You can open a poems trading account (young investor) in Phillip Securities, park your money in the trading account and get higher returns on money market funds(PMMF is the largest retail sgd mmf in the market).Current rates is 1.2712%pa for SGD and 1.9465%pa for USD. No lock in period, returns are calculated daily, no sales charge/administrative fee. This is unconventional for someone at 20y/o will do(because usually nobody tell them). But a lot of our older client with surplus cash do this and it is something I think is the best place to park my idle cash for higher returns, high liquidity(1 day to withdraw to your bank via online/mobile apps) and very very Low risk.

2,"See all 3 comments AYAndy Yew10 Jun 2019PMMF about 70% is allocate to fixed deposit, 28% is in Govt bonds (Mas bill, singapore Govt bonds, Temasek financial, HDB, PSA, CapitaLand treasury) and bank’s bond. 

There is a chance that you will lose money. That is when the Govt or Banks is going down. Which chance is quite lowJansen Ng10 Jun 2019Ahh okay thanks!"

For myself i decided to park my savings in Singapore Savings Bonds. I recently purchased them, can earn about 2+% interest a year, backed by government of Singapore and you can take it out anytime you want with no penalty.0 comments4"

Grand MasterAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Depending on how much your savings is.But if you are 20 and waiting for NS, I think CIMB Fastsaver will be the best account for you. No frills and offers up to 1.5%Alternatively Citibank Maxi Gain is a High Yield saving account and you will need 70k in savings for thatUOB one offers attractive interests rate that is tied with your credit card spendings if you can apply for one or your parents are good to apply one for you.
Make sure you are able to hit the card requirements without spending more before going for it too0 comments3"
5,"Jansen Ng, Business Student at NtuLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 09 Jun 2019Interesting answer from andy, compared to conventional way of parking in savings accounts, especially useful for those who either do not have salary crediting, or cant hit the requirements for high interests rates, or already maxed out the salary crediting bank savings account (and subsequent accounts may only give 1%)Im actually doing it without intentionally doing it. Cos im actually waiting for a good time to enter stocks, hence parked it at poems pre-fund account:)0 comments2"
6,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Jun 2019For a no frills, easy but high interest, you can go for CIMB fastsaver. First 50k already gives 1% for no requirements.There are other savings accounts such as DBS multiplier, OCBC 360, UOB stash but these have requirements such as minimum salary credit, fulfil conditions, credit card spend etc. I think in NS it will be hard to hit those conditions too.Another alternative is Singapore savings bonds. Minimum is $500 to buy in with a $2 fee.0 comments1"
7,"James Yeo, Founder at SmallCapAsia.comLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Can try a few things:

Singapore government bonds
High yield savings accounts like dbs multipler provided you can hit the tier0 comments1"

 If you are confident of not withdrawing your money for 10 years, put into singapore saving bond(SSB). This will maximise the your interest of up to 2.6%. If you just want to park for 3 years, it will only get you less than 2% interest. Read up more. If you just wanna experience, go ahead and put in the minimum sum. Go read up and do a fact checkOnce you have started NS which lasted 2 years. Put into SAYS. This will earn you 2.25% +a bonus yearly cash gift. Do note that this is a 2 year fixed deposit and need to commit to maximise the yield. https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/saysNo point putting into multiplier account as it is hard for NSF and students to meet the minimum requirements to earn the interest. Even if you do meet, you are losing more than you earn. At the meantime, u may want to learn investment. This can be easily be done by monthly investment plan, eg Posb invest saver, etc. Put into STI and hold as long as you can.
Note, it is not capital guarantee.

9,"See all 3 comments Alex Chua Cheng En10 Jun 2019If you are in NS, just sign up,  just follow the instruction. IF  you are not in NS, you would be signing up as SAYS. You then need to have salary accredited to your bank account as SAL.  You signing up in SAYS as NSF already awarded you with additional 2% so I don't get your questions.Alex Chua Cheng En10 Jun 2019For your second questions, I only know of CIMB fastsaver for non working adults. Otherwise u can try @andy suggestion. Anyway do remember to read up before making any decisions"
10,"Siow NanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Jun 2019Since you are talking about savings , not investments... I would recommend high savings rate bank accounts like DBS multiplier and uob one accounts.for salary credit, I went for DBS multiplier.. if you share a joint account with your spouse and both salary credit to that account, it will help both of you get into the higher interest tier in your individual multiplier accounts. Of cos would not apply to you in this case.uob one requires no salary credit but mainly a min spending on credit card of $500 + 3 giro transactions.0 comments1"
