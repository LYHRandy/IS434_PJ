1,"Soon XiaohuiLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 05 Oct 2018This is an interesting question.​Sometime even after we enrolled a course for it, we may still ask have we learn sufficient?​What I usually share with my friends & clients on investment - Always Learn to ask yourself questions. For example:what are the costs? are the costs transparent? Is this a purely investment tool? etc.You may be surprised that Some people cant differeniate what is unit trust & investment linked policy.how do I set up my account? is my account gonna be trust worthy? Can I withdraw easily?This is extremely important if you are investing into offshore products or a friend has introduced you into an investment scheme (which may be a scam). This step is extremely important as we do not wish to fall into scam while learning more about any form of investmentwhat are the concern(s) of this investment product/tool?Can I answer/address to my concern(s)? If yes, it means you actually understand the product/tool to a certain extend.Am I comfortable with this investment?If no, please avoid investing. Always invest only when you feel you are comfortable with and you are ready to lose this amount.​And of course if you have attended or going to attend classes, you must learn how to identify/apply what you have learned. Experience does help in investment. This is how we avoid being a risky investors.​Additionally when someone told you, it is a guaranteed high % per month or per year, you should learn to say no to it unless these terms are documentated legally, however in reality such products rarely exists.​Also if you have time, maybe you can read this post https://www.facebook.com/groups/seedlyfinance/permalink/1827146314243393/​I did a step by step how to read on a fund sheet in the comment section. Anything unsure, feel free to drop me a text.​Hope the above step by step questioning helps you in your investment journey. :)​0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 07 Oct 2018If you want to invest in stocks but have difficulty understanding fund sheets, an alternative would be to invest via a robo-advisor. In summary, you just need to open an account and fund it, and the robo-advisor's software will do the investing for you. You may refer to the following Seedly reviews to find out more:https://seedly.sg/reviews/robo-advisors0 comments0"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Fund sheet, for an unit trust? Stay away from this product unless you really like to pay lots of fees and earn paltry or negative returns. I'd apply the same logic towards retail wealth management products out there. You need to pay a lot to get to your desired financial goal. Let's say your desired goal is to attain a million dollars before retiring. Try asking your financial adviser to structure something for you and see how much money and time it'll cost. ​Do you really need to read a financial report before you invest in a stock?  Perhaps a simpler approach. You only need to know the right groups of stocks to invest into: dividend aristocrats and dividend kings. Find out which stocks these are, why they are called aristocrats and kings, what are the current sentiment surrounding them (hint: Seeking Alpha's analysis sections), and buy them at a discount to current price (sell put options). ​Ask yourself why you want to invest. For your retirement nest egg? Or to give your family a better lifestyle? Know your whys (reasons), then identify your hows (choice of investment instruments). Then focus on mastering your chosen one instrument to achieve success. Don't diversify. ​All the best in your investment journey. 0 comments0"
5,"Jay Liu, Sleepyhead at Land of Dreams Level 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Read and read. Maybe take an online course/youtube on accounting to learn how to read financial reports. The basic I think 1 should know will be the commission fees, fund managers managing the product, use fundamental analysis to determine whether is it good to invest in, is the price over valued. Most importantly is to read news on news article or simply at SGX to see their outlook/ acquisitions. 3 comments0"
