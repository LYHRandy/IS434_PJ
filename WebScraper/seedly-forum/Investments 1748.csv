You should be ready to put up at least $10,000 for wine investment. To get started,  you can focus on these wines for investment purpose - Fine Bordeaux and Grand Cru Burgundy. If you cannot invest in these, you can look out for flagship wines for investment. This is likely to bring higher returns on investment in future.0 comments0"
