2,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey there Kalpesh!​We just sent out a email regarding this issue via our support@seedly.sg :) look out for it and let us know if you have any questions. Always here to help!​But let me cover it in detail here:​After some preliminary discussions with the SCB team, we have not been able to reach an agreement with the bank, thus we are unable to allow users to sync as they will start to block our users who do that.​Hence there is no set date on when syncing can be restored. Thus, the SCB link will continually remained to be in a 'disabled' status we will definitely update if we have a fix. ​On that note, really thank you for your patience and understanding. Do trust in us that we are doing all we can to get to a better conclusion with regards this!​If you have any further questions or issues, please do not hesitate to hit reply! or reach us at support@seedly.sg.​Cheers and have a great National Day week ahead!Kenneth2 comments0"
