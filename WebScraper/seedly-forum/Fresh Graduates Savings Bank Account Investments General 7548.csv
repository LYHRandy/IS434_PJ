question,"Fresh Graduates Savings Bank Account Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Oct 2018What should I do with my $18,000 savings that is stored in my ePOSBkids Account?I'm 25 and have around $18,000 savings in my ePOSBkids Account. Recently read about what I should do with my salary (20-50-30 rule). I'm very keen on growing this small sum of savings, but have never invested before. Not even in the STI ETF / Robo-advisors, which I would be starting on with my monthly pay. What should I do with my $18,000 savings?Also, any tips on how a newbie like me should start looking at higher risk investments than the STI ETF / Robo-advisors?2 answersAnswerBump0"
