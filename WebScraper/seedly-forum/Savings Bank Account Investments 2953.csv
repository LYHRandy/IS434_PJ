question,Savings Bank Account Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Dec 2018DBS Multiplier vs SSB?My Multiplier give 2.2% PA.  While SSB usually give an average of 2.4 2.5% over 10 years period. Im just thinking to take out my SSB (less than 1 years) and just put inside Multiplier. So is it worth to invest in SSB rather than Multiplier? Any catch here? 2.2% is lesser but it seems to be easier to control cash flow.Any advice is welcome. Thanks1 answerAnswerBump0

Rather than keep in SSB and stuck and wait for 10 years, with DBSM, the liqudity not only gives you the right amount of emergency cash liquidity, it also a good way to accumulate war chest and strike go for a shopping sprea during the next downturns. Not to mentioned that DBSM interest paid monthly over the 7th of next month. I would always see as $ in my bank a/c / pocket NOW is better than SSB which is like 6 months later and to realized the full 2.4 / 2.5% I have to get stuck 10 years, that would means I'd miss a lot of good opportunity since a lot of things can happen in the 10 years period. I second your choice! Cheers !0 comments1"
