question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Sep 2019Any insurance agents representing Sompo/Aviva and selling travel insurance?Looking to buy an annual travel insurance cover and realised only Sompo/Aviva covers miles-related bookings based on a recent MileLion article. Am keen to hear from any agents representing the above companies if the prices differ greatly if I buy through you/buy online?Have checked online and realised Aviva's plans can be purchased for $242/$354 (Plus/Prestige, after discount) but think I would be more comfortable having an agent helping me with my claims.1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 20 Sep 2019Hey Anon, I'm from an IFA and we carry Sompo and Aviva but I personally can't sell travel insurance. However, if you'd like I can give you a recommendation to a colleague. If you're interested, drop me an email at Hariz.Maloy@Promiseland.com.sg and I'll pass you on to a colleague who does travel insurance.0 comments3"
