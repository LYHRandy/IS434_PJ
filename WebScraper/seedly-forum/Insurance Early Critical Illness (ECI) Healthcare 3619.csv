question,"Insurance Early Critical Illness (ECI) Healthcare Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoWill I be able to get ECI and will I need to pay more for less coverage or anything?Hi, male, late 20s, non-smoker. Previously saw sleep doc in SG (stopped alr) + going for surgery to remove inguinal hernia (groin area, was told non-cancerous). Dad is diabetic and had a stroke in late 2018. I just did a routine health checkup and found no major issues other than the hernia (not urgent, surgery planned in a few months). My agent is from GE, looking at Supreme Early Multiplier. Thanks!2 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomUpdated 2w agoHi anon,Seeing as how you are going for surgery, my best guess is that your case will be postponed, as you are in the midst of a 'transition' in your health status. However, once you have recovered and if your doctor has fully discharged you with a memo stating so, you'll be able to apply. However, the exact answer as to whether you can get early CI cover will depend on the underwriting outcome, as only the underwriting will have the say as to whether they wish to accept the risk. Terms, if offered, could be either standard or with exclusion (not covered), or loading (increased premiums), or a combination. Unless you are rejected outright, you should accept the terms.Depending on your father's age when he was diagnosed with diabetes, it is unlikely to have an impact on the underwriting if he was diagnosed later in life. The stroke, being a recent event, will also be unlikely to have an impact on the underwriting; again, only the underwriter can decide, however chances that underwriting is impacted are definitely lower compared to your planned inguinal hernia removal. I personally feel that there is a strong chance that you are still able to get early CI cover, the only question is whether you will get accepted with standard terms. You can consider doing a parallel submission to multiple insurers or through an independent financial advisor in order to maximize your chances of acceptance.0 comments6"

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoI suggest doing a preliminary underwriting with every insurer available.Also, since you're applying for a Whole of Life policy, the underwriting view on it may be stricter than a term policy due to Morbidity Risk.In the prelim form that you send in, also mention that you're planning to get a term as well and see what the underwriters say.Also, if they accept you and perhaps give you a loading (extra premium), I suggest you take it up, and in fact buy even more insurance cover. Since insurance is priced on risk, it just means you may have a higher chance to claim for the benefits provided than your peers or probably at an earlier age.So just send in prelim underwriting to 6-8 different insurers and see what they say. I carry every insurer except GE and Pru, so do let me know if this is something that you may want to try.0 comments1"
