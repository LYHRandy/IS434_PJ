1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 May 2019The points are stored in your card, so cancellation means good bye to the points. Suggest you redeem them before cancelling the card.Just a side note, Cit Rewards Card gives you ThankYou points while Citi Premier Miles gives you Citi Miles. Both are different, and they don't pool.0 comments0"
