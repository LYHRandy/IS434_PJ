The Commission pay out can be better than your base in some cases. If you grow yourself into a regional role you can travel around as well.You learn people management skills As well !

GeniusAnswered on 19 Dec 2018I think you should, just to get some experience of sales and of course the income that comes with it. But don't lose yourself-- continue to look for jobs that you like and go for sth you're more keen in when the opportunity arises. Do ask if there's a minimum period you have to be in this sales job though. It'll be horrible to have to sign a 2-yr contract or sth0 comments0"

If it does not suit your preference, at least you know you had tried. Also, it will reflect positively on your resume.Competition is very keen out there. Grab the opportunity as the next batch of graduates are coming out soon. 0 comments0"

I would say yes.Also depends on your fields market, if you think it was just a down turn and you should be able to get a job in 6 months, i would consider no.But consider part time to have some income. Unless not required.0 comments0"
