1,"Vinod DassLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It would be great if you could bring in Luke Ho (https://seedly.sg/profile/luke-ho). I‚Äôve been following his content quite a bit recently and I like how forthcoming and generous he is with his answers despite the fact that he‚Äôs an FA. He also has a blunt way of talking that I find pretty refreshing (after all the hedging language that I‚Äôve experienced with FAs). I haven‚Äôt seen much Govt policy talk in his Seedly answers but based on what he shares on Facebook, he can probably handle it just fine.7 comments28"

8,"See all 5 comments Kenneth Lou04 Oct 2018Yeah @Loh Tat Tian, the difficult one is usually the Tax Relief portions... even we get confused every year!Loh Tat Tian04 Oct 2018Tax Relief are generally based on criteria. Its quite easy to follow through if you download their Excel provided at IRAS page. Then go through which criteria do you hit, e.g most of the time, the relief comes on 3 subjects


1) Dependents spending e.g (handicap / parents relief / child etc)
2) Retirement Planning (SRS, retirement sum topping up)
