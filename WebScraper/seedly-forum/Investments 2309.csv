1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Mar 2019Hello!i feel that there are many areas of the company that can be looked at besides its debt to capital ratio to determine whether it is a good investment. You can also look at the debt to equity ratio, interest coverage ratio and the profitability ratios of the company. It is important to look at many aspects of a company and not decide on whether to invest in a company solely based on one aspect such as in this case the debt to capital ratio. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
