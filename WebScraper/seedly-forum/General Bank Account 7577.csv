1,"Kenichi XiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Jun 2018If we are talking about investing,​How much profit do you want $10k to return you before you need to use that $10k?​or​How much that $10k can be an asset that you won't be spending but used to generate income to cover your expenses or add on to your savings.​That will answer your Question.0 comments5"
2,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Jun 2018It is a decent amount for investing. Probably pick 1-2 counters to buy because 10k if you diversify too much, the transaction costs will eat a big chunk of your capital.​So be prudent and choose the right stocks or etf to invest in. Put into Singapore savings bond is another good option.0 comments3"
3,"Kenneth ChiaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018If you have outstanding debt eg. Student loans, best to pay them off first. Otherwise can consider setting aside an emergency fund as your cushion before considering it as investment fund0 comments2"
4,"Yap Chuen HweeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018I think it is a great amount, provided you don't have any outstanding debt or are going to incur any outstanding debt in the near future, and have a decent social support structure going, i.e. not the sole breadwinner of your family or something. Once you have skin in the game, you will be much more  'invested' in learning about investments, making money, growing them. Even if you do suffer losses, I think the knowledge gained from investing early would  more than justify going ahead to do it now. 0 comments2"
5,"Ling KohLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 11 Jun 2018I personally think perhaps it would be better to continue to save up more before you start investing as 10k sounds more like a rainy day fund to me, so if I were you, i would probably continue to step up my saving & earning efforts and meanwhile, do more readings and educate myself on investing and the different products in the market! :)0 comments2"
6,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018It is a decent amount for investing. But that should not stop you from saving more to raise more capital for investment,especially if there are opportunities around the corner. 0 comments1"
7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018Invest only what you can afford to lose. Do you have other savings set aside for emergencies besides this amount? If not, best not to plough the full S$10k into investments straightaway.​You also need to identify the reason for investing. Is it for an upcoming big ticket item? Retirement? Future travel plans? That itself will help to select the types of investments that are suitable for your time horizon.0 comments1"
8,"Adrian Goh Jun Wei, Product at NodeflairLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 17 Sep 2018I would start investing if I were you!​If you are afraid that you need it in the Short Term,  maybe you can consider those that are penalty-free and liquid such as:Savings accounts that give you additional interests if you do not withdraw for that month, such as OCBC's Monthly Savings Account or OCBC's Bonus + Savings AccountSingapore Savings Bond0 comments1"
9,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 17 Sep 2018No amont is too little to start investing. I started with nothing but just do monthly DCS into STI. If we don't start, we don't go anywhere.At least we start with something good, stable, grow more and learn more financial along the way, especially at seedly. ​Now after we have start up, don't forget to budget well so that you have enought $ monthly allocate into investment.

10,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018It depends on your risk appetite, but you can definitely start investing with that sum assuming that you have another sum of emergency funds. Low risk - Singapore Savings Bonds, Fixed Deposits Mid risk - Robo-advisors, ETFsHigh risk - P2P lending, stocks 0 comments1"
11,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018That is a good amount to start with.​take a look at what other bloggers are doing 0 comments1"
12,Phyllis PoonLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Keep saving until there is a crash in stock market. Markets are still overpriced now0 comments1
13,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 12 Jun 2018Seems a good amount for investment.  However, before you start investing, have you already set aside some money for the rainy days / emergency use which is recommended to be min. 6 months of your salary. If you have yet to start work, it will be appropriate to set aside a min. 6 months savings of your average monthly expenses first. 0 comments1"
14,"Gibson JunxunLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018I think it’s a good amount to start investing provided you paid off your student loans which  might have high interest rates, it’s good to start with 1-2 counters after doing your due diligence but don’t expect amazing returns when you’re starting out 10k. it takes time :) 0 comments1"
15,Alan SeowLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018Yes. It's actually a good amount to start investing. But focus would be on your style of investing. Growth. Dividend or leveraged investing and your risk appetite. As always read and start with a trial account where no money is involved first. 0 comments1
16,ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 11 Jun 2018Always good to start early (time in the market > timing the market imo).But make sure you know what you're doing and not enter sham investments! Also find out what your investment style is like: is it more of long term/short term? Dividend/share price investment? Are bonds okay with you which has guaranteed but trickle returns?  0 comments2
17,"Raimi JasmanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 17 Sep 2018If it’s  me I will keep saving the amount of money until I feel that my emergency funds are enough for my expenses up till 6-12 months. ​Read more ore to gain knowledge or if you don’t like reading like me, talk to more financial consultants at fb or ig. They are willing to share more. ​All the best! 0 comments0"
18,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Keep saving and while doing it, continue to read on investments. You can also start DCA as it's Low cost. For me, my 1st 10k is in SSB. 0 comments0"
