Close the DBS Remix Account.​Try to have as a few account as possible and focus on ur main account.​DBS Remix Account might not have  fall below fee for life but​1. $2 withdrawal fee if more than $4 ATM cash withdrawal in the month​2. Counter transaction $2 per cash withdrawal for amount within ATM cash withdrawal limit​3. highest interest rate is 0.1%​Just point number 3 is enough for you to move on and Pt 1 and 2 make life difficult for u when u need cash most.​IS better to be faithful to ONE then to have an affair.​Please upvote for me Only if you see Quality in my reply. Thank you.0 comments0"
