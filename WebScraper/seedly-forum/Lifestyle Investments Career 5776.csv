1,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Apr 2019Not sure what field you are in. But other than Salary, there are other things you can look at. Time-off, Annual leave. Subsidies for phone bills if you are expected to be out of the office & receive calls from Clients, Subsidies for potable electronic devices if you are expected to work out of office & the company don't provide. Basically if you already happy, with salary and benefits, it's actually easier.Try to counter from the angle of self improvement and can be read as a benefit to the company. Don't just look at the current situation, You can also ask him what he expects from you if you plan to move up the company ladder. Support for joining position/project you are interest in joining, overseas placement in future. Subsidies for enrichment courses, etc?0 comments0"
