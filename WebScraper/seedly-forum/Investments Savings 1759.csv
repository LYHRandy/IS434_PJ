question,"Investments Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 Nov 2018I'm a final year student with school fees of $38K but my father has paid for it first. Sadly, I only have about $1.5K in my savings now. What advice could you share with me that would really help?I'm conflicted as to what I should do better to manage my finances as a 24y/o.  Right now, I try to spend less on unnecessary things and am freelancing to earn on top of my $500 allowanceI know it seems I'm in a terrible financial state and I'm pretty sure there are people like me too out there who are looking to change their lifestyle or habits to prepare for the future so any help would be greatly appreciated!6 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Apr 2019It's really nice of your father to pay for your school fees. If extrinsic goals motivate you, maybe make it a goal to repay your father that $38k within a timeframe that you have set yourself. While you would be in a better position to save when you start working full-time! But meanwhile, it's already great that you are freelancing and looking to cut down on unnecessary spending :)Earn More X Spend Less X Invest Wisely Earn More: Given that you are currently studying (I assume full-time), this would probably need to wait until you have graduated and are generating a monthly income. Of course, you could decide to run a business as well, but that comes with its own risk/reward profile. Spend Less: You are already cutting down on non-essentials, which is a great start! Everyone's definition of 'essential' is of course different, so perhaps you want to work on that target amount you want to save (or repay your dad), and work back on how much you need to earn Less spend each month. Invest Wisely: Once you've amassed enough to pay for your own monthly expenses (instead of relying on a $500/month allowance), you can start looking at allocating some of your capital into investments. Many resources online that are free, start small and be informed.0 comments1"

Everyone started out that way, and we all started with $0 or maybe a little more. Based on what you have you are in a great financial position with no mounting student loans and other debts, and there can only be brighter outlooks in your life ahead. The fact that your school fees are paid off by your father and a $500 allowance, gives you more leverage to go ahead in life and sharpen your current set of skills to perform in future. if you really want to plan ahead for your finances, what i suggest is you complete your current set of studies and finish that thesis or whatever you have. That gives you the skills to survive and earn your rewards from being productive at work.Moreover, the basic skill of budgeting for your daily survival necessities are way more important than your wants in life at this moment. The rest are to be used for whatever emergency that you need. Your keep will come soon once you get that job after graduation. Freelancing is great; you get to experience and improve other skills that can otherwise help you in future.It is good that you are already thinking ahead of your peers. However, you must remember that you are still a student, and your first and foremost job right now is to  get good grades. To put it in a financial sense, you are earning knowledge to brand yourself and become more valuable.0 comments1"

While its quite normal to lead a pretty carefree life while studying, saving is something important to learn to curb the output especially before you start working, or else the sudden newfound 'wealth' might lead to lifestyle inflation. Things might snowball from there. I started by reading up on articles to save money (differentiating between wants and needs; looking at cost per use of items) + started with an expenses app. The beauty of the app is that you can categorise your expenses. At the end of the month/year, it generates a pie chart/percentages to give you an idea of what you have spent. This can help you see if you are spending disproportionately on certain items and also help with budgeting. From this, you can see how relatively small expenses add up. Its good that you are working. Work and save to build up some capital before you look at other forms of income e.g. investments. 0 comments1"

At least your father paid for you first so theres no need to worry about interest. Start setting a budget and track your expenses. Once you get a job, start doing a fixed payment to your dad for the school fees. Make sure you save your money for future as well at least like 20% if possible. (if you can save more also good for your own sake) You can also use the savings to invest but do remember to read up before investing.You can even automate the savings and payments so that everytime you get your salary, automatically put into a savings account and also pay your dad a fixed amount.0 comments1"
5,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Nov 2018It's good that your father could pay for your school fees first so that you didn't have to take up a study loan which would incur interest. As others have mentioned, focus on completing and excelling in your final year first before focusing on earning money. After you graduate and find a job, do your budgeting and you can discuss with your dad regarding a repayment plan where you can pay him a little every month. 0 comments0"

We all start somewhere and usually with $0.Focus on doing well for school, and find the best opportunity possible right after you graduate.In fact, I would recommend you to even spend some money to learn a trade skill. Something someone would pay decently for.Skills are way more important than the class of honours you graduate with.0 comments0"
