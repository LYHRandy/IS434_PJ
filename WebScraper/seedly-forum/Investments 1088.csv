God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Look at the pie chart as an example. 40% in property includes your residence. If your net worth is 1m and your property is already 500k, you may not want to invest in anymore property/REITs.You don't have to diversify across product providers so 1 robo is fine. And you don't have to buy 5 bonds, but have one bond portfolio/fund should also be fine as long as it's investment grade and global.2 comments4"

Bonds work better in an active management structure rather than an ETF structure."
