1,Jacky YapLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Hi there - im using saxo too. I believe it is a TT if your registered account is in USD. If it is a Singapore account it might be a giro transfer. Best is to just call the hotline. :)I remembered withdrawing from my USD account too and was charged a small fee.2 comments0
