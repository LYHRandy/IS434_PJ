Worst thing to do when investing.If prices are dropping and the investment philosophy is still sound, you should be adding in more money not taking it out. We're going through a market bump, nothing big yet but everyone's losing money. Time in the market is more important.In fact, I suggest you to not look at your returns for the next 3 years if possible.You'll only make money in the market in the long run, not in the short. Please make sure you know what you're investing in, what your portfolio comprises of before investing. If not, you'll make mistakes like this.0 comments0"
