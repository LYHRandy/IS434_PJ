To open a CDP account, you need to have a bank account with one of the following banks in Singapore â€“ Citibank, DBS/POSB, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank and UOB. ...Step 2: Choose a brokerage and open a brokerage account. I use CGS CIMB and DBS Vickers myself. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
