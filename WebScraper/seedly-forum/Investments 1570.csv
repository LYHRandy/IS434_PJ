MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Hi Anon,You could look at tactical asset allocation as a subset of strategic asset allocation.Strategic asset allocation is a target allocation of asset classes you expect to have in place for a long period of time, whereas Tactical asset allocation is a short to intermediate-term view that looks for investment opportunities in the market. In other words, strategic asset allocation is more concerned with the overall risk appetite and risk profile of the investor, and thereafter, decide on the asset class that the particular investor should invest in. For instance, an investor with an aggressive risk profile may want to be 100% invested in equities, as compared to one with a conservative risk profile, who could be looking at investing 60% in bonds and 40% in equities.Tactical asset allocation then looks at within each asset class, if there are favourable opportunities that the investor can exploit on to maximise his/her returns from that asset class. For instance, given the fact that we are at the late stage of the economic cycle right now, a wise tactical move is to allocate your investments to equities in the energy/healthcare sector. Also, it could be cases whereby you feel that this particular equity is undepriced/oversold and hence it would provide you with short term returns.0 comments2"
