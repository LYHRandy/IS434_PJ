1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019STI index advantage is local currency if you live in Singapore and no withholding tax. Disadvantages are subpar performances, low diversification at only 30 companies and  too much portion of the holdings are on the banking industry at around 40% (DBS, OCBC, UOB).0 comments0"
