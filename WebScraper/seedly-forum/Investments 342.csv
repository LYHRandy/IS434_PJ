question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked 3w agoIs it a bad time to invest in US index funds now (eg. S&P500)?I know that time in the market is more important than timing in the market, but a lot of Financial Analysts seem to talk about a market crash that is supposed to come and it doesn't seem to come in the end.4 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomUpdated 3w agoHey Anon, if you're starting a regular investment and plan to invest continuously regardless of market conditions, then no, it's not a bad time to start, because when markets do crash, you'll be buying low along the way.However, if you're looking to place a large lump sum right now, then we really don't know if this is a bad time to invest. Analysts have been predicting a market crash since 2016. And as you can see, that wasn't the case. I personally am still bullish and optimistic until about 2022-2024.But one thing we have seen is that even after a recession, the US markets tend to rebound. So as long as you have a long term horizon and do not require this money for at least another 10 years or so, you should be able to stomach the short term volatility.So something you may want to consider is also to diversify outside of the US, invest regularly instead of a lump sum, have a long term horizon, and make sure you don't exit the markets when things do turn south, wait for the rebound.0 comments5"

1. The return you want
2. Time horizon.Most people misunderstand the current situation.
Investing in US markets right now for the 10-15year time frame will result in pretty low gains because a lot of the future gains are already priced in. A recession may or may not happen - you should not worry about that because no one can predict it. As long as your required return is satisfied, you can still invest in the US today.
If you are looking at short term, then definitely there will be high gains in some pockets, but index funds are probably not what you should invest in, because they are just not volatile enough to give you that kind of gain.0 comments3"

Having said that, if your investment time horizon is more than 2 decades, then you should pray for a market crash as I do. Buy stocks like how you buy groceries. The cheaper the better.0 comments2"

Every year there is something bad or troubles brewing.I have been hearing crisis after crisis since 1998.  =)You are right, time in the market is more important than timing in the market. My father invested in 1996, just before the market collapse in 1997. He's fine ;)0 comments1"
