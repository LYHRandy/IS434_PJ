Unutilised donations can be carried forward to offset future income, up to a maximum of 5 years.But having said that, it's probably still better to spread out the donations than to do it in one shot, because you won't get your usual personal reliefs if the lump sum donation is sufficient to fully offset your annual income. 0 comments3"
