1,"Albert Tan, Fin Lit Trainer at MoneyOwlLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 15 Jul 2019Lifelong Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS) was briefly mentioned alongside the announcement of CPF LIFE Escalating payout plan. It was meant to be an in between option for people who were not quite satisfied CPFOA interest rates, but were too averse to CPFIS risk. The focus was on a low cost, long term, passive instrument. However it fizzled out subsequently.The difficulty lies in the implementation and sustainability. It's not difficult to find low cost instrument these days. The ability to provide a guarantee of at least 2.5% returns p.a. is a liability few want to undertake in the long run.It seems CPFIS will remain with 0% sales charge for the foreseeable future.0 comments2"
