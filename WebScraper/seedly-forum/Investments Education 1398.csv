1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 May 2019There is no need to. Finance taught in schools are mainly theory. There are no trading systems taught, so you will need to figure it out yourself once you graduate. You can apply the concepts taught, but it will take some time to build your own system. For me, I'd rather pay the money to attend an investment course to learn much faster. Much cheaper as compared to a formal programme in finance and you get results much faster.Of cos, what I said is moot if you intend to pursue a career in the finance industry.0 comments1"
2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 May 2019If you're not thinking of going into Finance as a career, it is not worthwhile taking a degree. You can learn investing just by reading widely and practicing. There are many articles, books, blogs available online for your peruse. Read a lot and a lot, compare the contents and try out the different methods. Over time, you'll find a methodology that suits you best.0 comments1"
3,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I won't say the major/degree is necessary, but taking 1-2 basic modules in finance is actually a good introduction if you are the type who needs ""forced studying"" instead of learning stuff on your own through books and web resources. The basic modules (level 1, 2) will allow you to appreciate the time value of money and how to read financial statements. No trading systems are taught, but hey, the actual trading process is always best learnt through getting your feet wet and developing instincts.0 comments0"
4,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019No highly not. I definitely agree with the other two answerers. Take it from me, i did Finance in NUS.But at the end of the day, alot of stuff you learn are things on Corporate finance. Not to say that the financial ratios and valuation models are not the same, but you hardly assess them from a Retail investor point of view.it does give you the basics but you can easily do that elsewhere Online or here on Seedly.i heard before, the best investors are usually engineering students, because itâ€™s a process and logical Flow, rather than gut feel. Hope these two cents help!1 comment0"
