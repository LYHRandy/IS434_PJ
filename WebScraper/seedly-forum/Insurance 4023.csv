1,"Josh Tan Jian LiangLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 15 Nov 2018I‚Äùve engaged with raffles shield before to cover for diabetes condition. It has to be raffles shield with RH option for him. You need to decide if buying private hospital coverage is worth it or just stick to B2/C under medishield life.  You check out the info in my post first. Take care üëåüëåüëå

I suspect it could be non-payment due to lack of funds. See if it's possible to reinstate without medical underwriting or some Ceveat to it. You can also login to his CPF to check (if your dad allowed). 2) You may wish to get a doctor to certify and try to sign up raffles healthshield if GE decline reinstatement nor reinsurance.3) AIA diabetes care (provided no diabetes related condition surface) could be bought for CI protection (though premiums will be high too).4) worse come to worse, fall back on medishield life, no choice. And start to buffer for higher medical bills. 0 comments1"
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Nov 2018Check your medisave deduction to see when was the last payment. Ask the servicing agent (if any) to enquire the reason for lapse. Otherwise you have to go down to customer service at  Great Eastern Centre. Unfortunately, reinstatement of policy back to standard terms is usually not possible. Diabetic will be a declined case for medical insurance. If all else fails, I might be able to help your dad to join a group medical plan. It covers as-charge up to $100k annually in private hospital. Premiums are about $2k a year. Add me on facebook if u require further help. 0 comments0"
