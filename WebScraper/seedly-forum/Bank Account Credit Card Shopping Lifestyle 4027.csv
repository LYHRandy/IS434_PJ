question,"Bank Account Credit Card Shopping Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Aug 2019Should I use OCBC 360 or DBS multiplier?I’m a young working adult w/ a take home salary of $2240 and bank balance of $30,000. My monthly expenditure is approximately $500-800 including insurance from GE. Will OCBC be better for me since I’ll very likely hit $35,000 soon and thus enjoy the better interest rates? Also, which credit cards will be appropriate for me? Leaning towards OCBC as there is the GE cash flow card to help me do monthly instalments. Please advise!1 answerAnswerBump0"

2,"Question Poster18 Aug 2019Hello, thank you for answering :) However, I noticed that the savings calculator does not take into consideration OCBC's above 35k bank balance rates as well as the step up interest. Which is why I'm writing a post here! :)Tee-Ming Chew19 Aug 2019Ahh understand now.. I don't really have the exact calculations now but I believe (based on a quick glance) that the difference will not be big for your case since you just hit $35K. Hope someone can jump in to answer this!"
