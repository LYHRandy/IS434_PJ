1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Nov 2018There is no right or wrong in insuring for your loved ones.What is important is, is it affordable for you? If not, choose to downgrade (and at least they still have medical coverage)If you can afford, best to keep it. The type of care you want is dependent on how luxurious you want the care to be (private), or more affordable yet not compromising too much (A ward).If cost is still a concern, the minimum is the standard plan offered by all insurers.0 comments0"
2,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Nov 2018Buy what you need. As long as you are employed and could afford the premium for your mum and yourself, you both may want to be covered for private hospital. However, if you are unemployed and could not afford the premium, it would be better to downgrade to public hospital. There is no right or wrong answers. It really depends on your needs and whether you could afford.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Oct 2018You pay for what you get.​But thankfully in Singapore, our public hospitals can be relied on well enough to provide quality care.​If budget is a concern, then a Govt A ward plan is more than good enough. Premiums will rise pretty quick from 65 onwards for your mom, so no problem downgrading to save a few thousands every year.0 comments0"
