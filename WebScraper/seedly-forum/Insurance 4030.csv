1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Nov 2018A quick search showed that AIA actually has insurance for pets. I'm not sure waht considerations you have, but being in the k9 unit, I can assure you taht dogs come with a mountain of problems (i still love them).One very common problem especially for dogs is skin care. many of them (especially long-furred) tend to have skin problems. They not only require treatment, but sometimes even the diet has to change. Which brings me to the 2nd thing that can happen- diet problems. There are actually feed that is prescribed by the vet that helps your pet, not just for stomach problems, but for varying reasons as well! And these also cost a bomb.Thirdly dogs also commonly have ears/eye problems, which usually last a lifetime and you will have to constantly pay for medication.Lastly, especially for big dogs, many of them will have joint problems. So please don't overfeed your dog, or keep giving them treats.Not sure how pet insurance works, but hope this helps you in taking into consideration the common problems that are prominent in dogs!0 comments2"
