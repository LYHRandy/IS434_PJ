1,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019By theory ""investing ALL"" sounds like a bad idea, as the context of ""ALL"" might differ from people to people.​With assumption your ""ALL"" is the amount you are willing to set aside and with other expenses/savings covered accordingly:​1) There is no ""best method"" , all suits to your personal cash flow. financial management, duration (tenure) , risks appetitate and many more. ​2) Typically ""professional"" says 110 - your age = To invest in equity. For example 40 years old, 110 - 40 = 70. So you get this magic number of 70% stock and 30% bond in your example.​3) Depending how hardworking you are, I would prefer NOT to RSP, and to invest from time to time, rebalance whenever I need to.​4) No best method to rebalance or time frame, because sad to say, market reacts in different ways and sometimes in wonders. If you want more certainity or stability, ETFs might be a good way to start.​Personally I rebalance about 2-3 times a year with no fixed duration, usually Q1, Q3 and Q4.1 comment1"
2,"Say Kiat06 Aug 2018Thks for answering. Appreciated. Correct me if I'm wrong: While risk profile remains same or changes due to personal circumstances So it will not be a fix amount from time to time when rebalance is done?  Can explain how do u do the rebalance part like for my investment assets stock n bonds if deviated >5%, start to sell the winners n buy the losers or do u consider market cycle too to enter? Any recommendations for reading or seminar to attend on this?"
