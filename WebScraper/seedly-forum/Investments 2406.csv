1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019Hello!I personally think that it is important to check on the quaterly earnings results of each of your portfolio companies. This helps to ensure that the investment thesis remains valid for each holdings. You should scan through the basic components of the company's profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement abd when the dividends were declared.Hope this helps!0 comments0"

I also make sure to look everytime there's bad news. Not to scare myself, but to understand the dip in performance and make a another decision to top up if there's a buying opportunity.0 comments0"
