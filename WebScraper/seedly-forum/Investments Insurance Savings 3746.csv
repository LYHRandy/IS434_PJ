question,"Investments Insurance Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Jul 2019Any advice for more insurance coverage?I'm currently in my late 20s, with an annual income of around 60k, and about 90k in ETFs/REITS/SSB. I'm not yet married and I still stay with my parents (both not working). I bought a direct purchase term plan (with 30 CI) for 20 years non-renewable, back in 2015, sum assured is $200k. And an Integrated Shield Plan (AIA HSG MAX A) as well. Just wondering if I need to add on more protection? Any advice is welcome, TIA!1 answerAnswerBump1"

If you are, then you will need some form of income protection. A usual rule of thumb is 10 times your annual income for death coverage, so you might want to look at increasing that.The standard list of Critical Illness since 2014 has 36 defintions, and in the past 4 years, early critical illness plans have become more affordable and widespread as well. You can consider if you might need more cover on this aspect.0 comments6"
