2,"HMHeah Min AnLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 6d agoMy humble 2 cents:I assume that you've set aside your rainy day funds.What is the goal that you want when you invest $200? Would it be capital appreciation, capital preservation, dividends or..? Choose 1 only for it simplifies your decision processI started my journey 10 years ago. Everyone was a beginner. Choose a tool that you understand the most because it reduces your investment risk. I invest in REITs currently because I want to receive my dividends0 comments0"

A beginner can consider ETFs for passive investing, stock picking is a skill and requires a lot of time and effort to read up which mostly cannot afford to unless it’s their day job. StashAway will give you global exposure to the markets. However, eventually, you might want to move away from robo-advisor because the fees can rack up quite a bit when your portfolio is huge like in 6 digits? And by then, you’ve learnt enough to decide what a good global ETF is to you.You can now consider investing in STI ETF for the local stock market exposure. After which, if you wanna bring down the volatility of your portfolio, you should consider buying into local bonds like A35 or MBH?0 comments0"
4,NNinjaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 1w agoDon’t waste cost money or expensive management fees on mutual funds. StashAway is western-based ETF so you can go to POSB and buy Nikko AM STI ETF with dollar cost averaging of $100. Exposure to local businesses is good0 comments0
5,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 2w agoI believe in diversification. I would not top-up into Stashaway in your scenario. Why not try doing some dollar cost averaging method for funds instead? This would help you to get exposure into different assets and at the same time diversify your holdings.3 comments0"

So let's say you found a fund to your liking and you decided to go into it. You can choose to invest $100 or $200 depending on your budget get it started.Vincent Tan Wen Bin2w agoPersonally I have tried using. Stash away monthly contribution. Funds monthly contribution. ILP monthly contribution. BCIP monthly contribution. BCIP is blue chips investment program. You can choose a blue chip stock and use a dca method to invest."
