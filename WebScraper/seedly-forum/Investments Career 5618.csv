Not sure if you read about the recent job cuts for Nomura. https://www.straitstimes.com/business/banking/nomura-axes-8-of-9-equity-research-jobs-in-singapore-in-us1b-cost-cutting-planI think people entering the industry need to really be a cut above the rest and have to find someway to differentiate themselves.0 comments2"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered 2w agoI've always wondered that as well - as to why university students are so interested in investment banking/PE related jobs. It could be a badge of honour, and being able to say one can work like s*** til ungodly hours.
When I was in JC, I asked a senior who was in IB, and after 2 years in the job, she said it was the worst decision.
Keep in mind, pre-2008, jobs in IB/PE was seen as very lucrative and prestigious. I do think that times have changed though.1 comment1"
