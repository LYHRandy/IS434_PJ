God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Apr 2019Good to do a up a full financial plan and check his current net worth, retirement expense and retirement funding methods.As long as all his assets and cashflow can provide him the lifestyle he wants to live without needing to go back to the work force then sure he can retire. Everything becomes way clearer once you have things on paper and tabulated. Do make sure to get both your parents to understand that they might be retired for 30-40 years, and they still have to adjust their expenses for inflation.It's very important now to not take much risk in their asset allocation and to start building passive streams of guaranteed income coming in.CPF Life will only start paying in 10 years time, so if he's stopping now, you need something similar asap.0 comments0"
