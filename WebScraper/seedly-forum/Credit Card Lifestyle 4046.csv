Credit score or rating is a rating assigned to you that allows banks and other financial institutions to determine if you are a credit risk. If you are a high credit risk. banks won't grant you new credit cards or loans. If you are a low credit risk, banks will approve your new credit card and/or loan application. Nothing to do with minimum spend.And yes, as long as you make a valid transaction on your card, you will be entitled to the flat cashback.0 comments1"

Credit score is affected by your ability to pay the credit card in full and on time.Cashback entitlement, Well this depends on what credit card you are refering to. If you refer to Standard chartered unlimited cashback then there is no min spend requirement. If you refer to other banks like OCBC365, then yes there is min spend required for cashback.0 comments1"
