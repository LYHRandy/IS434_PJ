1,"Leslie Koh, Associate Financial Services Manager at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 3d agoYou should consider paying in CPF first. Using cash to pay off your loan is not a good idea as your home is an illiquid asset, hard to convert back to cash when you need it urgently in times of need like medical emergencies or loss of job.Consider putting your money in other areas, like investments or bonds or even high-interest savings account.0 comments3"
2,Alvin TeoLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated 2d agoThe bigger question could be what is the best way to optimize my financial resources? If you can leisurely get >6% by investing then go ahead and invest rather than payoff quickly. This is just an example.Financial resources can be either CPF or hard cash.Cash is always king so donâ€™t be in a hurry to use it up.If you want to take a good hard look at this you can speak to an independent financial adviser such as myself to see how you can best put your money to good use.0 comments1
3,"KAKhairudin AliLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 2d agoIf can service and clear your loan by cash. Reduce the usage of CPF. Why?You will be accumulating accrued interest over the years upon using your OA which you need to pay back to your own self if you decide to move. Many does not see this as an issue but if you're in need of cash and your assets is not making money, then it is an issue. CPF OA generate 2.6% . It doesn't make sense paying for a loan which charges you 2.5% using an account which generate you 2.6%. might as well you pay using cash in you bank account which generate 0.05%.I hope this short answers aasist your queries.Cheers!ðŸ˜„0 comments0"
