You can apply for a BTO (Singaporean) but you will fall under Case 4 as elaborated on here: https://blog.seedly.sg/hdb-cpf-grants-bto-vs-resale-flats/You'll be considered under the singles scheme and are eligble for the Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) (Singles) â€“ Grant amount of up to $20,000. Half of the average household monthly income for the 12 months before the flat application must not exceed $2,500.You could also check out more information for non-citizen spouse scheme here.0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 20 Apr 2019The eligibility conditions for buying a HDB BTO flat are stated in this website link:  https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/hdb-flat While you can try appealing to HDB (email hdbsales@mailbox.hdb.gov.sg or visit your nearest HDB branch directly), it is unlikely they will grant an exception to your case because that would mean opening the floodgates for future similar appeal cases.You are better applying for Singapore PR for the foreigner (F) in the couple if you are planning to get married and go for the HDB BTO flat afterwards. Or build up more cashflow to go down the HDB resale flat route to save yourself the trouble and inconvenience of approaching HDB for an exception appeal that is unlikely to be granted.0 comments1"
