MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hey Linda!Answered a somewhat similar question here: https://seedly.sg/questions/do-you-guys-think-sgx-is-a-good-country-to-invest-shares-in I have to admit though, apart from the US and Singapore, I don't know much about the stock exchanges in countries such as China, Japan or the UK, which are popular countries where people buy stocks from the exchanges. Here's a list of some of the most popular stock exchanges in the world!  https://www.ig.com/sg/trading-strategies/what-are-the-largest-stock-exchanges-in-the-world--180905 I think for a start, maybe you could consider buying from a country that you are more comfortable and familiar with!0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Every country have its opportunity, you dont have to invest in different country individually. There are also ETFs that holds multiple stocks from various country. If you have the knowledge on how to pick a good stock, you can simply start with Singapore. Then slowly move to countries that you think will do well.0 comments0"
