1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Mar 2019There are 2 ways that you might take to take advantage of this IPO.Firstly, you can invest in shares that are currently investors in Uber. Alphabet, Blackrock, Microsoft and are currently investors in Uber. When Uber IPOs, the shares these investors are holding are likely to go up in value, and the shares of these investors will most probably go up in value also. Another way you can take advantage is to invest in shares of companies that are likely to go up due to Uber's IPO as well.  Or if you believe Uber will face legal and regulatory issues in the future as some people think, you could buy into companies that might benefit from Uber's downfall.0 comments0"
