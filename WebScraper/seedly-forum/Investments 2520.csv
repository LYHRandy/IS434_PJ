1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Highly doubt this. Private equity is big now all over the world. Less scrutiny and more freedom to operate.Looking at what happened with him and TESLA, it is highly unlikely he would want to consider the public route with another baby of his! Just some two cents0 comments1"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Have to agree with Kenneth on this! In fact Elon was unhappy with constantly having to pacify shareholders which was why he tweeted about taking TSLA private. Sadly for him delisting is an extremely complicated process. Moreover, SpaceX doesn’t suffer from a lack of private investors who believe and want to support Elon’s Mission of inhabiting Mars. It would be even harder to manage shareholders given SpaceX non cash flow generating operations.0 comments0"
