Grand MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019At the beginning when you know nothing about credit card, stick to CASHBACK credit card.then take the weeks and months slowly to learn about credit cards and various cards for miles or for cashback.I will say just go for any decent cashback card first, don't have to be the best card. Some choice can be Standard Chartered cashback or OCBC 360 cashback card.0 comments1"
