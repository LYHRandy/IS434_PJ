If you fall ill right now, you'll get treatment from a Singapore Hospital.The limits on Malaysian Medical Cards are usually about 100-250k SGD while an integrated shield plan here is easily 500k-1.5m depending on the type of benefit you want.You can get that shield plan as a foreigner from a few insurers. I suggest checking out NTUC, Raffles Shield, and AIA.Speak to an independent advisor like myself to understand how the policies work and get a comparison for those that offer their policies to foreigners. :)1 comment3"

Other than travel insurance, insurance policies should only be in force in the country of purchase. If you are savvy in insurance, you can check out the various comparison websites online for term life insurance. Otherwise, do talk to a financial consultant.For medical insurance, you should check what sort of coverage your company group insurance provides first. Then maybe look at additional coverage if you like to.1 comment1"
