1,"Arpita Mukherjee, Community Evangelist at Kristal.AILevel 5. GeniusAnswered 2d agoHello!Since this a new space you are entering, I'd suggest that the first thing you do is read up and try to understand the basics of investments. And then once you're through with that, go for a robo-advisory platform to do the job of assessing your current financial position and recommend a portfolio strategy after reviewing your risk profile. As for the ""catch"", I would say that Robo-advisors are still not very different from your ordinary financial advisors as both options will still have a management fee incurred for users. The difference lies with the amount, as Robo-advisors have lower management fees.
I work at Kristal.AI, and my mojo is to help people make the right financial decisions. If you think I helped you, do give me ""Thumbs up"". If you think my response was biased let me know, I will work on it.
I hope this helps you make the right decision.0 comments4"

1.investing $100-$500 per month use posb and Maybank
2.investing $500-$1000 per month use OCBC @3%,min $5 or Maybank @1%,min $5
3.investing $1000-$3332 per month use OCBC @0.3% ,min $5
4.investing $1000-$5000 per month
Use standard chartered,@0.2, min 10  For monthly purchase of A35, there are only two options, standard chartered and posb1.below 1k,use posb invest saver
2.above 1k,use standard chartered @0.2%,min $10  Due to me serving in national service with a paltry pay of $800, allocating $100 to Singapore bond index fund and $100 to STI ETF(g3b) is just right manageable hence I choose POSB invest saver. Besides, I am pretty sure everyone owns a Posb account from the first day you were born, hence convenient is also a huge factor here you can either pm me through fb or comment on blog or simply read more about POSB invest saver at my blog:http://sonicericsg.blogspot.com/2019/01/post-77week-59investment-project.htmlhope this helps!:)1 comment2"

WizardAnswered 2d agoPersonally as a fresh grad I was more extreme and would spend $800 a month on all expenses (disclaimer: at that time my office provided breakfast, lunch and coffee in between so I was able to save quite a bit) and simply had no time to spend money due to long work hours.
With regards to investments - start reading up and also deploy a small amount to investing. There are so many asset classes that you can invest in, so it makes sense to get educated on what your options are, and the risk-return profile.
For no frills savings accounts, there is CIMB. Re: multiplier accounts, get one that doesn't require a spending minimum that is above your usual rate of spending. Personally I have found Citibank Maxigain to be quite good as long as I don't touch the principal amount - and that gives me a few hundred in terms of interest a month.0 comments1"
