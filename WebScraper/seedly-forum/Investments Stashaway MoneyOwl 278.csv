1,"Asheesh Chanda, Founder at Kristal.AILevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 10h agoThe fees you mentioned are very high. You should evaluate platforms like Kristal.AI or even a self managed Saxo account. At Kristal.AI we have made ETF investments upto 50K USD completely freeFor 1K USD, you can get a good deiversification amongst ETFs and even REITs.I would suggest you evaluate a systematic plan into a balanced portfolio - which has a good mix of Equity ETFs, Bond ETFs and Gold. Systematically adding to such a portfolio every month can help build a corpus over time. You can also run the algorithm we have made available at Kristal.AI to see what is the suggested recommendation for your profile.0 comments5"

God of WisdomUpdated 2w agoHi anon, you have to give due consideration to your preferences, risk profile and time horizon. These 3 factors will give you an idea of what kind of asset classes will play a part in your portfolio.Personally, I do not do investments via an insurance policy. An investment should always be something that you can liquidate at any time, subject to the transaction charges, and of course, being able to accept the value of your investment at that point in time. It is not exactly correct also to say that UTs give lower returns, as we are not having a fair basis of comparison here.To properly provide you with an analysis breakdown of the proposed Manulife policy would be better if you can provide the policy illustration that should have been sent to you. Then you can understand the plan better.$1000/mth budget (you typed 1000K but I think you meant $1000?) would allow you to comfortably DCA into a portfolio of funds/ETF and also start a guaranteed annuity as a hedge against risk. Take note of the transaction costs as well. I'm presuming your motive to invest is to prepare to retire here, so for starters, diversify your portfolio across various asset classes in order to manage your risk properly. As your budget grows over time, you can start to look at adding shares to your portfolio. As always, speak to an independent advisor to get more clarity on the matter and also to understand your options before you begin.0 comments4"

4,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 2w ago1800 for fees is very expensive from what I’ve learnt so far. 
3x12 monthsx1k=36k
1.8k/36k= 5% of your investment amount. 
I know it equates to 0 net costs, but it doesn’t guarantee you will get your returns right?If I were you, I will just park it in some high yield savings account like DBS multiplier. At least it’s guaranteed earnings as compared to buying UTs or ETFs. UTs and ETFs need a longer time frame for better returns, no? And I just googled a little bit more. InvestReady is ILP. Do correct me if I’m wrong. ILPs are probably not the best way to invest your monies0 comments0"
