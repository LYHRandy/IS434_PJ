1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hello! There are a few ways that risk can be quantified, Richard has mentioned a few but I will just list a few more here.Alpha: It is a measure of how well a portfolio has performed relative to a certain market index. The difference between the two returns over that of the index measured as a percentage can be measured as Alpha.R^2: It is measure of the correlation between 2 variables, can be used to measure how correlated a security is to a market index. The higher the R^2 is to 1, the stronger the correlation. Sharpe Ratio: This help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk and is a measure of the expected returns over the risk-free rate per unit of total risk (a measure of volatility). This ratio is an indication of how well a portfolio will perform if it takes on more risk.Value at Risk: This is measure of the maximum loss that you can bear with given at a certain confidence level.0 comments0"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hi Anon!There are basically 2 types of risk - systematic and unsystematic risk. Systematic risk is known as the market risk, or the risk that all companies within the market are exposed to - for example in Singapore's STI, though DBS and Mapletree REIT is in different sectors of the market, market risks such as Singapore's political landscape and trade wars with other countries are all risks that affect all firms within Singapore. These risks cannot be diversified away, and are somewhat your ""base risk"" - meaning that no matter how diversified your portfolio is with no matter how many stocks in different sectors, you will still never be able to remove this risk exposure, unless of course, you don't invest at all in the market.Unsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk, is firm or industry specific, and affect just that individual firm/industry. For example, a scandal in the accounting practices of perhaps say, Bank ABC, is a firm-specific risk that affects Bank ABC, but not the entire banking industry, nor other industries such as Energy, Automotives etc.These risks add to to form your portfolio's total risk - determined by standard deviation. Essentially this measures the volatility of the price of the stock. Big S.D = Big price changes. Another determinant of risk (in this case only systematic/undiversifiable risk) is  Beta, or the sensitivity of the firm's performance to the market's performance. Portfolio's beta can be determined by taking the weighted average of all the betas of the stocks within your portfolio, and the standard devation is determined through formulaic calculation regarding standard deviation of each individual stock within your porfolio and their correlations with one another. I will not explain further as I believe there is alot of materials available like Investopedia that explain this concept much better than I can over here.I hope this helps you understand a little bit better about risk, and feel free to correct me if I have made any mistakes.0 comments0"
