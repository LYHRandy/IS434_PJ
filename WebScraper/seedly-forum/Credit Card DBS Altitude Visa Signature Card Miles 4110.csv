question,"Credit Card DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card Miles Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Jun 2019Is anyone familiar with DBS Altitude Card? I have a few questions. would appreciate if anyone can help. Thanks!Is there any other difference between the VISA and AMEX one other than the fact that the VISA one has complimentary lounge access?Could someone explain how the card works? Like if i purchase a $50 item, is it i will get DBS points AND miles? Or just points that i will have to convert to miles?Understand that there is no expiry date, but is it for the DBS points or after convert to miles also no expiry date?Oh and is the 1 additional mpd worth it for 2.2% fee?Thanks in advance! :)1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 15 Jun 2019The Altitude Visa, other than lounge access via priority pass, also allows you to earn miles via SimplyGo! when you take public transport. You also get access to various other Visa exclusive privileges.You will be awarded 3 DBS points for every $5 spent, rounded down to the nearest number. The points will be converted to miles when you transfer them to a partner airline.Once the miles are credited to the frequent flyer program, the clock starts ticking. If they are still in the form of DBS points, they do not expire.Think of the 2.2% fee as buying miles for 2.2 cents per mile. Your valuation of a mile will determine for you if that is worth. Personally, my upper threshold is 2 cents, so I would not pay the 2.2%.0 comments6"
