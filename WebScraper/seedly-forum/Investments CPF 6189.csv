question,"Investments CPF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 May 2019Where does dividend made for investments with CPF go?This might be seen as a stupid question. Earlier this year I made some investments using my CPF OA. My CPF investment is through DBS. My investment will be receiving dividends this month. Where will it go to? Directly into the CPF OA? Or into the DBS CPF investing account?In addition, DBS will charge quarterly fees. How will they deduct this cost? Directly from my CPF account?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dividends will go back into your DBS CPF-Investment account first. After 3 months in the CPF-IA, it will auto transfer back into CPF OA. Same process with selling stocks. The money goes to investment account and sit there for 3 months before auto transfer to CPF OA.You can manually initiate the transfer back to CPF-OA. This will mean you get to earn interest on the dividend or capital gains for a longer time period.Quarterly fees will deduct automatically from CPF-OA.1 comment1"
