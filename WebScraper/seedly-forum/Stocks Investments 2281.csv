1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Different people use market values and book values. Creditors or lenders to a firm may look at book value because they may look at the repayment capacity of the company while equity investors may look at market values and compare it to book values to look for under or over valude stocks. Generally, there are a few challenges of book values, is that they are updated only on a quarterly basis, but market values can be updated on a regular basis based on shares trading on the exchange. Market values can also capture certain elements of the firm which can't be captured on the ""books"". For example, human capital can't be reflected in the book value of the stocks. Also, market values could be in some sense more ""forward looking"" because the market can value earnings potential which may not be reflected on the books.0 comments0"
