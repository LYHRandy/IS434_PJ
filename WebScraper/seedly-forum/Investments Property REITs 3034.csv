5,"See all 5 comments Lok Yang Teng15 Nov 2018 REIT ETFs offer a convenient method to gain exposure to multiple sectors and geographic regions with just a single fund holding without having to transact each REIT counter of different sector or region individually and incur high transaction costs in the process. REIT ETF fund manager rebalances the holdings of the ETF on behalf of the ETF holders according to the investment objectives of the ETF and index benchmark criteria . Weaker REITs will be replaced by better performing REITs, which will in turn benefit the overall performance of the REIT ETF.Question Poster16 Nov 2018Thanks"
