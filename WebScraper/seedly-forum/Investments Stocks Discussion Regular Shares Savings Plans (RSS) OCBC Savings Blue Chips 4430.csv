1,"Victor Lye, Founder & CEO at SquirrelSaveLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Sep 2019Do browse the online digital investment services now available. These are the alternatives to traditional investment services which charge higher fees and require higher minimum sums. You should also assess your own investment style.
After years of investing experience, I advocate steady investing and global diversification. Problem is that we sleep and we can't monitor markets all the time. Hence, using AI-driven investment services is an alternative.0 comments3"

God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Sep 2019I would suggest that you take into consideration the costs of investing, as Takingstock as detailed below, fees will put a dent into your investment. However do note that Unit Trusts have zero fees on POEMS, so you're basically investing every cent from the first dollar. You should examine if UTs are a suitable asset class for you first before proceeding, as there are many types of UTs out there.Take some time to gain knowledge first as you are still young and time is on your side. There's no right or wrong answer, but only what suits you best. For blue chips, I would very much rather wait for low prices to buy in, instead of dollar cost averaging (due to fees)0 comments3"
3,"Dhruv Arora, Founder & Chief Executive Officer at SyfeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Sep 2019Itâ€™s good that youâ€™re thinking of investing at an early age. But before you start investing, Iâ€™d suggest building up your emergency fund, having adequate insurance and minimising any high-interest loans like credit card debts.You can consider RSS plans if you want exposure to Singapore stocks. But if you want a diversified portfolio with exposure to global stocks and bonds, digital wealth managers like Syfe may be another option. (Syfe has no minimum investment amount.) Apart from investing early, diversification is one of the other keys to successful investing. Simply put, donâ€™t invest all your money in the same place e.g. in one specific stock. A diversified portfolio helps reduce your investment risk so that you wonâ€™t lose everything if the market underperforms. To diversify your portfolio, you would want to invest in different types of assets such as stocks and bonds. Next, diversify your investments within these asset classes. With stocks, this could mean investing in a mix of large cap, mid cap, and small cap stocks for instance.This is also the reason I generally advise against picking individual stocks. Instead, I recommend investing in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for quick, easy diversification since ETFs allow you to invest in a large number of stocks through a single transaction.0 comments2"
4,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 09 Sep 2019Am trying to answer something similar for a friend, but will share my thoughts if it helps others.A) For OCBC BCIP, the fees work like this - a minimum of $5 or 0.3%. So above monthly investment amount of $1700, you will start paying 0.3% fee charge, which is $5.10 for 1700. You have about twenty options to choose from under BCIP.B) For the POSB invest saver, I think you only have two indexes to choose from, but the transaction fee % remains fixed at 0.82%.For me, at about monthly savings of $600, there will be no difference between the two in terms of fees, because BCIP will land about 0.83%.The rule will be going for the lowest fee possible.
If you have no investing experience, then going for an index fund first is a no-brainer. You buy into the average, and you will get the same returns as the index for the lowest cost.However, if you have done your homework, and believe the counter you have selected will beat the index, then do that if your transaction fee % does not go above... well, I did say 1.3%, which would be at least 400 for BCIP.At 200 / mth, the fees work out to be 2.5% under BCIP, and it can really put a dent into the overall returns. Unit trusts used to have a sales charge of 2.5% or more, and it would take a while as you investment first tries to overcome the transaction costs before you see returns.3 comments1"
5,"See all 3 comments T@Takingstock @09 Sep 2019Bcip has three index funds, a: the nikko am sti index fund (g3b, tracks Straits Times Index), b: nikko am corp bond etf (like a bond index), c: lion philip s-reit etf (like a reit index).

Posb has the same G3B that tracks STI, and another ABF bond etf.

So between the two plans, you have about 4 options.T@Takingstock @09 Sep 2019If you dont have much knowledge, starting w index is great. You can't do above or below average, because you are already buying the average. 

But u get to experience the ups n downs, see dividends (i do think they ask if u wan to reinvest dividends).

Give yourself a year, learn more, find out what makes u anxious, happy, or content. Usually its a long game, and compounding takes even longer. Learn patience."
