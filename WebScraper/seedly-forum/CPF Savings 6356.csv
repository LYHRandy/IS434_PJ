MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi, in your case, I would suggest CIMB FastSaver which gives you 1% interest so long as you maintain at least $1,000 inside with no other requirements such as salary credit or minimum spending like DBS Multiplier in order to earn the extra interest. Moreover, you can easily transfer funds out instantly and for free via FAST into your DBS account for spending (withdraw/card transactions)2 comments1"
