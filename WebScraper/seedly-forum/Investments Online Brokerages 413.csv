question,"Investments Online Brokerages Asked by Serene TohAsked 3w agoWhat should we look out for when choosing an online brokerage?I'm looking to invest in some European stocks, which are not covered by SCB which I'm currently using. Was looking at Saxo. It seems relatively safe but fees wise lose out to interactive brokers, which has a less user-friendly platform (according to reviews- https://brokerchooser.com/best-brokers/best-online-brokers)What would be the key factor for you? Additionally, anyone knows if Saxo & IB have custodian fees & how much?7 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoIf it may help you, although POEMS has a custody charge, idle funds in POEMS account will earn returns in a money market fund, which does help clients offset their custody fee.As an alternative way to look at it, returns from a good stock will more than pay for the custody fee, so the custody fee helps you to be more critical of what shares to buy.1 comment5"
2,Serene Toh3w agoThanks. Unfortunately poems don‚Äôt have access to the market I‚Äôm interested in that leads to this question.
3,"Kishor BhagwatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 3w agoJust do an excel sheet and compare the trading commissions, fixed fees etc for the amounts you plan to invest and trades. Will take 15min to figure out the cheapest.
IBKR has another advantage - really cheap FX conversions. Add that to your sheet too.
IBKR has a PC version, a mobile app and a simpler Web trader option.1 comment1"

6,"MIModel InvestorLevel 2. RookieAnswered 3w agoI would definitely recommend SAXO, if you do not trade often, SAXO is having a referral promotion which you can refer here: https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/accounts/referral. The referral fees are more than enough to cover commission costs and miscellaneous costs for quite a number of trades.1 comment1"

ProdigyAnswered 3w agoHi,IB has really good low fees and no custodian fee but the downside is that you have to meet certain criteria to not incur the $10 monthly fee which is to either have over $100,000 in assets invested with IB or transact $10 fee worth of stocks. As for Saxo they don‚Äôt have the account minimum that IB has but they do have a 0.12% custodian fee which has no minimum, their exchange rate is also excellent. If you are an investor who purchases a lot of stock then IB would be better but if you don‚Äôt transact a lot Saxo would be better.Hope this helps.1 comment1"

11,"Serene Toh3w agoThanks. Actually they have something similar to poems‚Äôs custodian fee, they call inactivity charge. Which is a killer fee for me, cause I don‚Äôt make that many trades. I need to think about this carefully."
