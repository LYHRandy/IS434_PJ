MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019Ask for best fit for your situation.Best in terms of ROI (even for CPF Life) also differs.Hence do let us know what's your criteria for ""best""?Is it cost to coverage, cost to payout, cost to special conditions which you wish to get covered?In order for people to tell you what is best, you need some criteria.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Best is subjective.What you may want is highest guaranteed and non guaranteed payouts. Speak to an Independent Financial Advisor to get comparisons for your age, comfortable saving amount, and period. I specialise in lifetime annuities and are a big advocate for their uses. Drop me a message if you'd like a comparison.0 comments0"
