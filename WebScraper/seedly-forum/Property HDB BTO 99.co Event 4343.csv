1,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 20 May 2019This is a difficult question. Cause we have no idea what your taste and expectations are. If you check renovation websites, they typically recommend. $50K for a new BTO, but this is not for luxurious finishes.You can prob go lower if you go for the bare min only. Go check website like quavast, etc. There’s quite a good range of renovationwebsites in Singapore. If you are not touching the bathroom and kitchen, it will reduce the cost quite a bit, except for a few appliance.Do note that typically the cost and any cost quoted by the ID or contractor, will exclude all furniture, kitchen appliances, equipment and light fittings.Take note of the floor finishes rate. A Low per sq foot rate will be quoted for the most basic material. Typically, people won’t chose from this range of tiles, if they are paying for ID.The biggest problem with renovation is the over Budget that comes along with the upgrades that the owners decided on after signing the contract for a basic finishes. So do make sure that you are ok with the finishes before signing.0 comments0"
2,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Cindy!I think it really depends on the maturity of the estates and locality of the BTO as well. Tampines, Toa Payoh ($530k) could cost 100% more than a BTO at Sengkang / Punggol ($280k)Not sure if this is what you're looking for, but if you simply want a bare BTO from HDB, then you may locate the past launched prices here -- https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/new/bto-sbf1 comment0"
