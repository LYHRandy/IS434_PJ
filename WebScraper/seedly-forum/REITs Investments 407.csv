Find an entry point when the spread between nav and the current price is low.Another thing is the REIT sector. Are you comfortable with the outlook of the sector your chosen REIT is in?Look out for funky management decisions as well (case in point - OUE). Or is management prudent? Is the REIT DPU stable? Growing over the years?Some basic things to look out for before investing in a REIT. Hope this helps0 comments0"
