MasterAnswered on 14 Jan 2019When you say ""while studying"" do you mean during your holidays, or literally when you are still having classes and all that?I think that it's easy enough to find internships online. You will learn basic marketing tools and techniques that you will generally not learn in school.If you really want to steepen your learning curve, might I suggest that you join a start up, because there, you get to learn fast, and you get to learn a lot as well!Some companies do allow a part time internship- these can be tiring though!But I think all in all it's great that you want more exposure before you graduate, so that you can relate when you study to a more practical usage!0 comments0"
