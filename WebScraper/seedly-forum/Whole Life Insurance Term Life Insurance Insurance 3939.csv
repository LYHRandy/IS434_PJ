1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Jan 2019Depending on the insurer and current status of the condition, likely to be offered non standard terms. You may wish to do a preliminary underwriting application with the insurer of your choice to see what terms will be offered. This way, you won't have a 'black mark' when asked if you have been offered non standard terms on other applications 0 comments1"
