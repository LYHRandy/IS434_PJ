1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Aug 2019Krisflyer Saver: Cost you lesser miles but availability is limited. Definitely will tio waitlist if the route is popular. Your travel plans have to be very flexible. May not necessary get the dates you wantAdvantage: Cost more but almost certainly have availability for the dates you want.To summarise, Advantage is paying more to secure the seat early and for the dates you want and have peace of mind. Saver is paying less and half of the time, pray hard you will get the seat you want at your desired dates.1 comment1"

3,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 20 Aug 2019Hi there!If you redeem flight tickets, you will often find that there are two rates to compare. For example a recent flight slection I made: You can see that the Advantage price is almost 2x more than the Saver rates.Business Saver or Advantage:
These are the 2 rates for redeeming flights via miles on the Krisflyer website.As the name suggests, Saver flights cost less in miles, but they're limited in availability. You can refer to this whole chart which gets updated occasionally.
If you want more options, you'll need to spend almost double the miles for Advantage.
All the information is readily available on the KrisFlyer redemption charts.More details:• A round-trip award ticket requires twice the number of KrisFlyer miles shown on this award chart. • SilkAir redemptions are only available at Saver award levels. • Redemption is not permitted on Singapore Airlines codeshare flights operated on the aircraft of other airlines. • Award tickets are subject to seat availability at the time of redemption, which may be capacity-controlled by the airline at its sole discretion. • Travel must be via a published route of the airline. The fares shown on this chart are not applicable to itineraries with backtracking routes. • Singapore Airlines Suites and First Class are only available on selected Singapore Airlines flights. SilkAir does not have a Suites/First Class cabin. Business Class seats will be allocated to members who redeem their miles for Singapore Airlines Suites and/or First Class on Singapore Airlines flights which do not have a Singapore Airlines Suites/First Class cabin. The number of miles required for the entire trip may be determined at the redemption level of the highest class of service flown.

Economy Class seats will be allocated to members who redeem their miles for Premium Economy award tickets on Singapore Airlines flights which do not have a Premium Economy cabin.
