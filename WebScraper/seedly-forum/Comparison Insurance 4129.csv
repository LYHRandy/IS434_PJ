MasterAnswered on 05 Sep 2018Besides these 2 plans, there are also similar plans for for multiple protection from Tokio Marine, Manulife, AIA.Such Multiple Claims plan have very complex clauses on the eligibility to claim multiple times. You should actually speak to a FA to learn more about it.As for reviews, such plans are still relatively new in the market and may not have the claims track record yet.Let me know if you wish to find out more.
