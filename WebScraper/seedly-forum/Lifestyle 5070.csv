WizardAnswered on 20 Nov 2018We tends to call the unknown factor that make things work  = A stroke of LuckI think hard work lays foundation and many times just need the right equity, the right market, right people , right timing. So long as we lay the foundation , do the hard work (because even win lottery also need the work and $ to go buy ticket) , reward will comes  (not lottery ðŸ˜œ)As it comes at time we expect it (we call it reward). When not expected, so we call it Luck. 0 comments0"
