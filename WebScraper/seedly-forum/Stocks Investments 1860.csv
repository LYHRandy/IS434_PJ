1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Preferred shares are a certain form of shares that are different from common shares, and they often have both elements of bonds and shares, making them some sort of hybrid investments. Priority over common shareholdersThe whole basis of why the 2 form of shares differ in the first place is that preferred shareholders have priority over common shareholders. In some sense, preferred shareholders are senior to common shareholders. However, lenders and bondholders have higher priority and seniority as compared to all forms of shareholders. Higher Claims on DividendsPreferred shareholders usually receive higher dividends than common shareholders. If a company has not paid out their dividends, they would also have to pay their dividends to preferred shareholders before common ones. This means that when it comes to building a fixed-income portfolio, preferred shares might be a good alternative to consider. Voting RightsBy becoming a preferred shareholder, you most likely would have to relinquish your voting rights. This means you can't vote during Annual General Meetings. Seniority during liquidationDuring a company's liquidation, preferred shareholders would receive their portion of value first before common shareholders. Hence they are safer than common shares. Hybrid Preferred shares are a bit both like bonds and common shares. They are like bonds because the dividends are fixed, preferred share are more senior than common shares and they don't usually have voting rights. Yet, preferred shares are like common shares  since they are owners of the company. Also, if the board of directors does not pay out dividends, the company is not liable to any defaults or legal actions.0 comments0"
