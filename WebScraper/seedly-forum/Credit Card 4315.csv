Credit cards do come with benefits like cashback or earning miles, or dining deals if you are into those. With benefits comes responsibility to pay off your monthly credit card bills in full. This helps in maintaining a good credit score. 0 comments0"

5,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Yes that is correct, charge bills to your credit card and always pay it on time to build a good credit score. Moreover, you'll also save on any interest and late payment fees. If you do not use the credit card, they have no data to build your credit score since you wouldn't even need to pay any bills to begin with. 0 comments0"

Check credit report and rectify any mistake.Free check at: https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/available-options.html​2. Pay any cc bills on time/all the time in full (not partial or min).​3. Avoid applying for multiple new cc within a short period of timeSometimes a few new credit applications will push you from a responsible consumer to an unreliable one from a bank’s point of view. And every bank has a different set of requirements and criteria to satisfy.Whenever you apply for new credit facilities, it would put enquiries against your credit report. Many enquiries within a short period of time can have an adverse effect on your credit score.​For your information, “Previous Enquiries” are retained on your credit report 2 years from the date of enquiry. So it takes a long time before the effect wears off.​4. keep your credit active​But if you do not use your credit, the banks cannot assess it. If you have “insufficient credit activity”, there is very limited information such as credit applications or accounts status history to derive a score.​5. Commit to keep it simple and improve your credit score​default records stay on your credit report for 3 years upon full or negotiated settlement, and bankruptcy data is retained for 5 years from the date of discharge.​It is ok if you have made mistakes before. But if you want to see the light of the tunnel, you know you have to commit to the following in the long term:​Check your credit report annually and rectify if there is any mistakePay your bills on time, all the time and keep your balances lowAvoid multiple new credit applications within a short period of timeKeep your credit activeAnd your credit score will work out fine.​​Tips: Read this hack on getting highest credit score in SG​https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/how-to-get-aa-credit-risk-grade-in-singapore0 comments0"
