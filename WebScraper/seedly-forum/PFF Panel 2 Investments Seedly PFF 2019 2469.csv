1,"Tai Zhi, Chief Investment Officer at AutowealthLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 05 Mar 2019How do I invest in a US ETF like the S&P 500?You may invest an ETF by trading (ie buying/selling) the ETF off the stock exchange using a normal stock trading account. Both local brokerages like DBS Vickers, UOB Kay Hian, etc and international discount brokerages like Saxo Capital Markets, IG Markets etc would offer the trading account required.Would you recommend that?No, unless you are an expert comparable to Warren Buffet, George Soros etc.(1) Invest broadly to diversify away riskDo not be too narrowly focused, diversify broadly so that specific market developments like U.S.-China trade tensions will not cause a catastrophic loss.(2) Include some government bonds holdingsTry to start off with a globally-diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds with a higher allocation to bonds. For example, you may consider starting with the AutoWealth Conservative Portfolio (60% global government bonds 40% global stocks) before switching to a portfolio with higher risk. U.S. government bonds made +5% profit compared to a -10% loss in global equity markets during the Dec 2018 market correction. It made +20+% profit compared to a -50+% loss during the 2008 GFC. Having government bonds would protect your portfolio and also make higher returns for you through portfolio rebalancing (ie taking profit on government bonds then buying stocks whilst they are cheap)Check out our blog posts for other useful investment insights and concepts: https://www.autowealth.sg/blog/0 comments0"
