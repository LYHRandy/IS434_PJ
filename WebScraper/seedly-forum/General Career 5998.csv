1,"HC TangLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Jul 2018Hi  Few questions you may ask yourself:​What do you want out of the job ? (A) Work on something that you're passionate about ? or (B) $$$ (if that's the definition of success that you wanted) ? ​If (A) is what you wanted, since you have the passion, you will excel and achieve success (gain rank and $$$) because that's where your passion lies and it will drives you to success. ​if (B) is what you wanted, then even Aviation may get Engineers job, it may get higher salary than Hospitality. Yet with the current trend of Tech, you might as well study development be in via recognize college / Uni or event self study online via Udemy and start doing some community / freelance project developing apps / block chain for people / company. That way you will get $$$ much faster and much more than being an Aviation engineer. '​All the best! Cheers! 0 comments3"
2,Jay TeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 20 Jul 2018Tough question - the truth is it takes a lot of hard work to perform well in any industry. If you want to go into aviation just because you think it's easier - i suggest you do not. It will probably burn you out in the long run - especially since you have already identified that you have a passion in hospitality. 0 comments1
3,"Pascal Samsoon, MBA Candidate at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 Aug 2018First. As per another previous answer...Start by mapping out what motivates you (money? fun? friendship? ownership? long list...)Understand what are the behaviours that suit you (your strengths, your skills, your personality...)Maybe, look at where you are now and where you want to be in 5, 10, 20 years time...From all of the above 3 points, develop your strategy...​""The only person who knows what is right for you is you"" ​Second. Once you got a clearer idea abour yourself at your CURRENT point in life. Then, maybe, you can start exploring the type of industries to go into. Why? ​Well, if you figured out from the first part that you are interested in working in a high pressure environment whereby split decision making are crucial for the well-being of thousands of people...then maybe a career as an air traffic controller would make sense for you...that's in the aviation industry fyi. ​The above was just an example. There are many scenarios. Please explore.​Third. Pick a good school next. Whether it is great for the type of role you wish to get into or for the industry you would consider entering. If you can't make a case for it, pick a school that can give you the right support system (from classmates to school admin). This is probably the hardest of all 3 points. ​Hope it helps​Pascal from Time to first byte 0 comments0"
