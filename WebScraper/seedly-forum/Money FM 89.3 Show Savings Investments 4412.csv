1,"JJefremy Level 3. WonderkidUpdated on 18 Sep 2019Singapore has created safety nets for its most vulnerable citizens. However, the millennial question is still up in the air. The government is reacting with lowering tertiary fees and such. As millennials, we grew up with information at our fingertips and grown to realise the fact that our HDB is not an asset, our CPF is a never-ending chasm that never gets filled and though we love travelling, our pockets are never full enough to go far. We have to learn from our parents' folly of not taking profits. Accept the fact our generation is crushed like the eggs in an egg mayo sandwich and plough through. Save and insure what you can to create a buffer from ruin, get smart about money and invest the rest.1 comment3"
2,NNinja4w agoI’m a millennial and i can say we are the most bullshit generations. Weak as f and stupid. I’m the small minority that invest and save. I can safely assure you that at least 80% of themhave less than $1000
3,"Adam Wong, Editor-in-chief at The Fifth PersonLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 4w agoThis is partly true based on studies in the U.S. -- https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/millennial-life-how-young-adulthood-today-compares-with-prior-generations/Even though Millenials are better educated than Boomers, Millenial _men _face higher unemployment. (Millenial women fare better comparatively because fewer female Boomers worked in the past due to gender roles.) Millennials on the whole also have slightly less wealth than Boomers at the same age and are more likely to still be living with their parents.
The Boomer generation benefitted from an unprecedented post-war global economic boom led by U.S industry. Millennials, on the other hand, face a more competitive global landscape and the fallout from the Global Financial Crisis. I couldn't find any comparative studies for Singapore, but the same could hold true since Singapore also underwent a post-war economic boom after its independence.In any case, the rules from wealth accumulation remain the same: Spend less, save more, and invest prudently for the long term. Just like how not all Boomers got rich despite the advantages their generation enjoyed, your financial decisions today ultimately decide how much wealth you're able to accumulate in the future.0 comments1"
4,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered 4w agoIf I said ""yes"", how does that affect you?If I said to your face you will fail your exam this year, do you think you will fail it?Underemployment happens, yes it might happen to you if you got an MBA, but still end up washing dishes... But is it because you didn't try, or you didn't try HARD ENOUGH?Higher living costs... Just like the stock market indices, prices just tend to go up in general, coz people also need to make incremental profits and inflation. It's the price of progress... Be glad for inflation... Unless you want to go experience deflation n stagflation yourself. Don't think the lost decade was a good time for the Japanese.Student loans in the US are bad but don't think it's that bad here in Singapore. Their interest rates can go up to xx.xx% (think I have seen higher than credit card interest rates). Almost everyone will have some debt in their life... You should learn to deal with debt, how to calculate your interest costs and the best way to pay the loan down.Problems don't go away if you talk about it and do nothing... They go away after you start taking steps to tackle them.0 comments0"
