1,"Devanshi Singh, Investment Planner, Writer, Adviser  at Financial Advisory ServicesLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 06 Mar 2019Yes, long term investors frown upon the share buyback by the companies as it affects their financial goal and they invest in the stock for years after planning the goal.But the share buyback is good for the short term investor as the price of stock increases with the share buyback. Companies buy back their shares when they believe that their shares are undervauled. They buy the share at the market price and resell them as the price reach the expected value.The share buyback is the signal that stocks are undervalued and after the buyback, the stocks gain the value, that increase the profit for the short term investors. But it can also be the false signal of the share price increment. 0 comments0"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 28 Feb 2019I think that investors will frown upon it for certain scenarios only.Some investors may frown upon it because it management may be artifically trying to boost share prices because some of management's compensation package is tied to different earning metrics, such as share options.Share buy-backs may also be more beneficial to short-term investors than long term investors due to the share price hikes. Some investors may prefer that companies grow shareholder value organically by investing excess cash for growth opportunities. If companies are always engaging in share buybacks, this could mean that they may have fewer organic channels of growth, or that management may be shortsighted.other instances when buy-backs aren't good is when the shares overvalued, but management tries to convience the market that the shares are undervalued by buying back shares.0 comments0"
