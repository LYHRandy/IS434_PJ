1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018The single biggest risk of the 1M65 strategy is policy and political risk. Could the Govt change it policy on CPF negatively and affect millions of Singapore? Of course. But what are the chances of that happening? If they hit the CPF with a negative change, it would carry a high political cost, Singaporeans might take it up with the ruling party during elections. Would the Govt risk it? The only two scenarios for a CPF negative adjustment would be when we have a rouge Govt, voted in by popular mistake, and they ruin the country and deplete our CPF. Or when there is a severe and prolong economic crisis that hit Singapore. When that were to happen, many other investment tools will also collapse in SG, including your S$ deposits. CPF might still likely be the least worst option for you then. remember : there is NO investment with NO risk. So you have to assess the risk vs the returns. 0 comments5"
