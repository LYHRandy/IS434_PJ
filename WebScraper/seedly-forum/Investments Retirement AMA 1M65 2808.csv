It is outlined here https://dollarsandsense.sg/1-million-65-using-cpf-heres-math-behind-1m65-conceptHence if you are looking to retire earlier you will need a different strategy. Personally, I'm looking to retire in my early 40s via the use of an options portfolio to generate the 60% roi I need0 comments1"
2,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Feb 2019Yes. Basically. In fact, 1M65 was 1M55 not so long ago. I have no idea how people in your position reconcile themselves to that fact when it comes to CPF...That being said, it's not unlikely you'll live to that age.So you can plan for your retirement at 45 using private investments for example, and the money only needs to last 20 years before 65 kicks in. Or the money from 45 can complement it by that age.Thats certainly one way. I'd love to help you with this if you like, since I enjoy structuring such portfolios for my ambitious clients. Who doesn't love a challenge, like retiring at 45?https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
