1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Hello! When deciding which sectors to invest in, I tend to compare some quantitative numbers such as the Distribution per unitProperty yieldNet property incomeGearing ratioGross revenue. A property yield of above 5% is a good indication that the REIT is maximising the income potential of the property. A gearing ratio below 35% allows for a buffer before breaching the regulatory cap (REITs have a gearing limit of 35%). Additionally, qualitative factors to consider would be SponsorsPotential growth in sectorThe sponsor is usually the major shareholder who provides credit and equity, thus having a strong sponsor will minimize the risk of the REIT encountering insolvency. A growing demand for e-commerce could result in a decrease demand for retail spaces, thus affecting REITs in the retail sector. 0 comments1"
