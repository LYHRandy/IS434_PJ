1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 19 Feb 2019Hi,Firstly, when you invest in a stock, you have to view it as investing in a business. The important thing about investing in Asia is to focus on business and management. Look at more recurring business and focus on management that are aligned with shareholder.Secondly, always pay at the right price because a good business can be a bad investment if pay at a wrong price.Lastly, the risk of investments are usually based on investors focus on the upside or potential of the company. When I do investing, I focus a lot of the downside. If you cover your downside properly eventually the upside will take care of itself.0 comments0"

3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Feb 2019The type of investment you choose depends on your age and risk tolerence. Generally, the younger you are, the higher the risk tolerence. There are many invesment vehicles out there; stocks, bonds, ETFs, robo-advisors, etc. Different mediums have different returns and risk. It is advisable to read up on the more common types to prevent being scammed early on. You should understand how the particular type of invesment works and if there are any dubious points. If you are unable to comprehend, do not start on it.The only risk of invesment is losing everything, quite straight foward. Therefore, only invest with money you can afford to lose. Never borrow to invest.There are many blogs, articles and videos online about investing. Take your time and look through those before you start your investment journey. All the best!0 comments0"
