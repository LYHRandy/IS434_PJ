1,"Cherie Julianne Tan, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Eating vegetables. Hear me out.I've never liked vegetables especially the stems. I have no reason behind that, I judged it by face value and didn't like it. Only till this year, I dared myself and grab the stems and learned to appreciate its crunch and bitterness. What an acquired taste, but it wasn't so bad afterall, I bet my parents are proud to hear this.In other words, I've learnt that some things I have to take the first bite and allow myself to go through the experience before making my own judgements. And to not let it hinder myself from taking the first step. :)1 comment5"

4,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 29 Nov 2018For me, it’s about PATIENCE. I feel that in our goldfish generation today, our attention spans can be so short thet we expect results immediately... especially the hard to achieve ones. So when I first started out in the working world, especially in tech, i was extremely inpatient and expecting things to grow so quickly. Or I tended to compare with other companies or growth stories and asked alot of WHY this is not working or slow or wrong.Rome was not built in a day.Today, due to the benefit of hindsight, I adopt a more balanced approach. it’s actually about segmentation. Finding ways to break down, what works and what does not, and what timeframes are realistic ones to look at. My biggest example is regards to company building with a strong mission. I read that really solid companies with strong foundations in culture and team, take at least 5 to 6 years to get right. So I’m really basing my beliefs upon that timeframe to think about what we’re trying to achieve here at Seedly :) it’s not an overnight success and will never be an overnight success but through a series of failures and trials which I’m extremely fortunate to have great people to go through this together! Thanks team :) woohooso yes, one word: PATIENCE. Nothing GREAT comes in a day.0 comments0"
