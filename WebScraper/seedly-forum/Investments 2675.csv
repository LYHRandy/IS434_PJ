1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019 Debt to Equity Ratio indicates the proportion of Debt amount a company has, to its Equity amount. While the Debt to Assets is a ratio that computes the percentage of total assets that are financed by debtors. The difference would be that the debt to assest ratio would involove both tangible and intangible assets whilst the Debt to Equity ratio involves only assets used for operations. 0 comments0"
