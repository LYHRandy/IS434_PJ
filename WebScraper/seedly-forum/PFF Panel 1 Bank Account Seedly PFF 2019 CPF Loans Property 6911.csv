WonderkidAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Using your CPF for housing will deplete your cash proceeds from the sale of your flat in future.Because:Sale proceeds = Sale price - outstanding loan - CPF used - CPF accrued interestThe more CPF you use, the less cash you receive = more money locked up in CPF.Therefore unless you are sure that you will be staying in this flat for the rest of your life, it is more advisable to not use it for housing wherever possible.Feel free to contact me for more information.0 comments2"
