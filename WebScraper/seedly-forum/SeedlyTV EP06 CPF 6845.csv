God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Jun 2019If you're single with no dependents, I'd go for ERS on an escalating plan.Headache free, passive income for life, adjusted for inflation, plus I'm not worried about leaving money behind for family.0 comments1"

For every dollar above $40k chargeable income, is taxed at 7%. If u topped up $1000, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved $70 in tax money. That is effective 7% 'return on investment'. If u are earning more, you will save even more as your tax bracket is higher.0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I would say it depends on your risk appetite and preference.In my situation, I wouldn't top up for ERS. ReasonWIth the FRS, there will be a stream of income coming in when I hit the age of 65.With the amount to be topped up into ERS, I would use those to invest in the market in either reits, stocks, bonds, funds etc to pay out a stream of dividend. This is to diversify my holdings and also ensuring that I have control over my funds Funds topped up into your CPF Life will not be able to withdraw and I think that I would prefer to have more control over my cash. If one day at age of 70, I would like to give a cash gift to my kids or grandkids, with funds in investment I will be able to liquidate them but if my funds are in CPF Life, there isn't anything that I can do to shuffle the funds around.Ultimately, it really boils down to preference. If you are risk averse and have excess cash and think that you wouldn't need or shift it to use it for other uses, topping up to ERS would be fine.0 comments1"
5,"BLBrian LeeLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 05 Jun 2019It depends how much you have in your cash assets. Assuming you just have about the ERS for your retirement, then I would not suggest to go for ERS. Should just go for FRS. Cause once in ERS, your money will be locked up and if due to emergency or rather sudden illnesses, you can't use the money. And at about age 80 to 82, there are no money leftover for your beneficiaries also.
However if you have additional funds from somewhere, then you can consider the option to go for
1) ERS - If you want a fix income throughout, no dependancies when u reach 70-80 (reducing each year)...
2) Retirement Plans - With slightly lower monthly payout for life, you get the option to withdraw/surrender anytime, growing death benefit for beneficiary each year... but must be discipline, else after you surrender (killing the golden goose), there's a lum sum payout but no more monthly payout for your future.. and we don't know when our time will be up.P/s: Do you know that FRS = 2x BRS but
Monthly Payout FRS <> 2x BRS monthly payout?
Similary the payout for ERS is not 3x the monthly payout of BRS. It's due to the additional interest calculation.0 comments1"
