God of WisdomUpdated 2d agoHi anon,You can do a quick check on your coverage by applying some common rules of thumb and comparing them against the sum assured:Death/TPD cover: 10 times of your annual incomeDeath/TPD cover: Your liabilities as well as funds to maintain your family's standard of livingCI cover: 5 times of your incomeCI cover: 5 years of expenses plus a baseline for out of pocket costsNote that these are guidelines (some clients prefer one over the other) and that you should sit down to review the exact numbers for certainty.The living policy is an older policy which you can keep. I am not sure when you bought VivoLife, if it was the older version with 125% boosted cover for 15 years, or the newer version (Vivolife 125/180/350). Both plans can be kept with no issues. The flexi endowment should also be kept going if you've had it for a while now.Your group insurance policies are a good benefit, but remember that they will only be active as long as you remain with your company; if you think you might change jobs, it is usually more prudent to have your own personal policies.ECI should be your next stage of cover. As you are still young (below 30), premiums are usually quite affordable. However, we also need to ensure you do not strain your finances in terms of affordability, so it would be good to have an idea of your cashflow and expenses. Once that is settled, you should start your planning for investments and retirement.Based on the rules of thumb, take a look at the coverage amount and you will have an idea of whether you are adequately covered or not.

2,"See all 7 comments Question Poster1d agoThank you for your prompt reply. Can I also ask what would be your definition of not being costly? IE to say, roughly what premium amount are you implying at and the rough payout based on a average singaporean OPE and expenses for 2 years?Elijah Lee1d agoDeleteEditHi, a good guideline will be that you are not spending more than 10% of your income on coverage. So it does depend on how much cover you wish to have.

As a guideline, if you are looking at $50K ECI coverage with a x2 booster to $100K cover before age 70 while you are working, it costs either $112/mth or $121.4/mth depending on your gender. Premiums are for 25 years and coverage for life.

ProdigyAnswered 2d agoIt's hard to give advice without the figures of your sum assured but based on what you have mentioned, I would say that you're adequately covered in terms of Death, Disability & Accident.
You should certainly concentrate on ECI for your next stage of cover.1 comment0"
