2,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019I've seen families that are able to cope well with S$3k/mth household income, and also families that are 'struggling' even though their household income is above S$10k/mth.All in all, each family is different. Rather than talking about absolute amount, it is more important to first address a couple of things:1) How much do you spend  a month on Mandatory stuff? (House instalment, Phone bills, Utilities, Food, Insurance etc)2) How much do you spend on Non-mandatory stuff? (Tuition, Overseas Trip, Entertainment, Visits to Cafes/Restaurants, Car)3) Are you able to reduce certain expenditure?A good benchmark would be able to set aside around 20% of your income for your retirement, and slightly less than 10% of your income on Insurance. With the remaining 70%, are you able to meet your Mandatory needs?If Yes, perhaps you can look at increasing the amount that you save. If No, perhaps its good to consider if you are living above your means, or perhaps take up additional jobs to have more income.My apologies that the answers above are pretty generic, but it would be tough for anyone to provide any recommendation/suggestion based on your question due to the lack of information. As mentioned above, every family has their individual needs and priorities.

My suggestion is that if possible you may want to consider to save at least $500 a month for future invesment.  1 comment0"
