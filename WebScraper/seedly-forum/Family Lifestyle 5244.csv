question,"Family Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Nov 2018I have been living with my boyfriend for 6 months, and he hasn't contributed anything. I love him, but how do I motivate him to get a proper job?I pay for rent and utilities, and my current job pays well. He helps with the housework, but I feel that he could be doing so much more. Our relationship is going well, just that I wish he would do something about this.7 answersAnswerBump1"

If it is something that weighs heavily upon you, definitely have an honest talk with him about it. Honesty and being open is one of the most important things to have in a relationship. 2. Consider why you are concerned.There are a few factors that could be in play as to why you want him to do something about this:A boyfriend with a proper job (I am assuming stable income, CPF contributing etc) makes him more of a 'manly man'. I know gender roles are shifting and alot more blurred these days, but still, there are some women I know (generally much much older), who seem to be ok with a husband who stays at home to do the housework.Is it the fact that he is doing nothing that bothers you, or the fact that he is not earning money that bothers you? Case in point: your boyfriend could be an entrepreneur working really really hard to run his business, but does not take home an income at this point. 3. Find out how HE feels about the current arrangement. Additionally, has he ever felt the same way, or is he perfectly comfortable with the current arrangement? At the end of the day, it helps to understand what the two of you value in the relationship. Do the both of you really love the person as they are, or just the concept of them?0 comments8"

5,"Shawn LowLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 29 Mar 2019Sit down and have a heart to heart talk with him. If he really loves you he will take action. Set a timeline. If he goes back to his old ways, my advice would to end the relationship. You deserve better.0 comments1"
6,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Dec 2018If you are looking into long term relationship, then you guys need to sit down and have a talk over it. Tell him how you feel that he should contribute a part too.  If he can't be bother and still remain the same, it's time to rethink about the relationship...0 comments1"
7,"Phoebeta TauriLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 Dec 2018Just get out of that relationship girl. He is just hogging your expenses. Don't ever try to sponsor him in his education or lend him any money. I tell you, this kind of guy will surely turn his back on you and not return you even a single cent. Trust me girl. 0 comments1"
