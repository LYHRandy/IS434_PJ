question,Investments Stocks Asked by Darren ChewAsked on 07 Jun 2019Most stocks listed on the SGX are not performing so why do people still continue to invest in it? Did they mistake it as REITs or are they blinded by the high dividend?Most of the business trusts listed on SGX are not performing and are trading below their IPO price5 answersAnswerBump7

1,"AYAndy YewLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019From what I gather from the retail investors, most people think REITs is too high, so they go for the Low lying business trust thinking they will eventually go up like the REITs. However the high go higher, Low ones continue to fall lower1 comment6"
2,"Darren Chew07 Jun 2019Yup, people tend to think that what ever go up will come down and what ever go down will come up. 
However, they may not realize that what ever go down may forever never come up again. Instead, it may be delisted, just like Rickmers Martimes Trust."

MasterUpdated on 08 Jun 2019Perhaps just to add on to what Andy has mentioned and just to give investors a little more confidence in SG's market, low ones continue to fall lower, yes its a possibility but at the end of the day it all depends on how much homework one wants to do. It's the same as examinations, how prepared one is, how knowledgeable is one on the company's financials. Rickmers and Hyflux had prominent red flags along the way. It's death wasn't a quick and painless but rather a long and expected one.Rickmers - Constant dividend payouts despite a consistently falling cash-flow / reserves, falling bottom-lines didn't help the business either. These signs weren't present a week before it filed for insolvency but rather a couple of quarters.Hyflux - Using debt to repay debt, that's a huge tell-tale sign of the company's struggles in repaying its debt. Did Hyflux experience this whole saga right after the issuing of the 2nd bonds? Nope, it took place a year later, similarly with the depleting cash reserves after each quarter of payment.I think a lesson to all for REITs / Business Trusts is to really do one's homework to see if dividends can be sustained.0 comments1"
