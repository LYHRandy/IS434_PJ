WonderkidAnswered on 18 Jun 2018There are brokers that could purchase your endowment/life policies (within their criteria) for a value  higher than the surrender value offered by the insurance companies. Do a google search, they should come up. Not too sure about the ILPs though.Anyway (admin please remove this is you think it is inappropriate) if you do not mind, you could let me have a look at your BI / the broker quotes. I see if I can generate better offer for your policies. Cheers. 0 comments0"
