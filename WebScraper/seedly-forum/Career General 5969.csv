3,"Darryl LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 25 Sep 2018Honestly speaking and in my humble opinion, $2000 income is not sufficient at all. Not even close to reach financial independence.â€‹Try to learn some high-income skills OR invest in your education to command a higher salary in higher paying jobs. If not, you will always struggle to set aside enough savings for investments, or even a future property purchase.0 comments0"

Your pay may increase over the years when you gain experience and climb the corporate ladder. $2000 is still doable if you're frugal in your spendings. Find some other side income too on top of your full time job. Lastly, try not to fall into debt. 0 comments0"

Pay should go up if you work hard as well. You can also take on side jobs to earn extra income. You need to work together with your partner and it will be much more easier.0 comments0"
