1,"Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019OCBC Monthly Investment plan is too expensive for someone who wants to invest $100 a month. $5 out of $100 is alr 5% cost. That's too expensive! Besides POSB InvestSaver, the other monthly investment plan that I will recommend is Maybank Kim Eng monthly investment plan. Do take a look!2 comments1"
2,"Guo Hao Teo18 May 2019Yeah agreed donâ€™t invest only $100 to start with. You are already net 5% down when you begin on the OCBC BCIPYCYewFong Chua18 May 2019I remember the amount that I started was $500 per month and I recall OCBC only charge me the first $5 transaction only. Subsequently, I was not charge for the $5.

I guess only when you stop and sell away your share. The new charges will apply again. Do check with individual bank to understand better."
