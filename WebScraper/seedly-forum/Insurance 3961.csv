question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 Dec 2018What other options do I have apart from hospitalization insurance?I am currently on IncomeShield Plan B and was diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism (Grave's disease) in Jan 2016. However, due to my secondary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation as a result of Hyperthyroidism, a friend advised that I have a high chance of being rejected in my attempt to upgrade my hospitalization coverage as the chances of relapse and linkages to something serious are high. I underwent an ECG today and results were normal. Are there any alternatives I can explore?3 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Charmaine Lim XiaomeiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Based on my experience, most insurers will allow you to upgrade your current hospitalisation plan / purchase riders but with an exclusion clause for thyroid & its related health issues. Once you are fully discharged by your doctor, you may try to appeal with your insurer to remove the exclusion (though I was advised by my agent that the success of such appeal is very low). However, if you decided to stick with your current plan, you will still be able to claim for Hyperthyroidism and Atrial Fibrillation.If you hold a full time job at the moment, do look at your company insurance as most corporate insurance covers pre-existing / existing / new health condition. PS: I have Grave's disease too and am currently claiming from my company's insurance for my regular outpatient visits (blood test, consultation and medications).(non-finance related) Lastly, would recommend you to:drink green tea daily! Doing so has shown great effects in helping me to lower my resting heart rate from 115-120 to 90-100include one spoon of extra virgin olive oil in your daily diet as it has been shown in many reports to help protect your heartget a fitness tracker so that you can track your heartrate1 comment3"
2,"Question Poster08 Jan 2019That's the thing, upon consultation with the underwriters, my friend mentioned that there is a 99% chance that my entire application will get rejected as Atrial Fibrillation could lead to critical ailments in future. Nevertheless, he advised me to proceed with the application as there's no harm knowing the definite outcome. And yes, I understand that I can still claim for Grave's / AF under my current plan, it's just that there are claim limits.

You will need to be placed on Holter monitor for longer period monitoring.Please msg me on my fb, there are still many questions i need to ask. Not suited to talk in public.0 comments0"

5,"Question Poster31 Dec 2018Hi, thanks for the answer! I've sought the advice of an agent and after consulting with the medical underwriters, he mentioned that due to the history of atrial fibrillation, there's a high chance my application will get rejected. Since it has the potential to develop into something serious and increase the chances of a claim happening. Gabriel Tham31 Dec 2018have you tried other insurers? there are many companies around, some may have different criteria and some may give leeway"
