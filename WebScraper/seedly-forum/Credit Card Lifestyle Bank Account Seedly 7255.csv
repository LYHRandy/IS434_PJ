question,"Credit Card Lifestyle Bank Account Seedly Asked by Yeung Kai HoAsked 3w agoHow do you use the Seedly app to track credit card expenses and actual spending when they differ?For e.g. you might use your credit card to pay for the entire meal i.e. $100, but you’re reimbursed by your friends so you personally only spend $20. Since the actual spending differs from the credit card charge, wow would you key in your app to reflect accurately your credit card expenditure and your personal expenditure without having duplicate entries?1 answerAnswerBump2"

2,"YKYeung Kai Ho2w agoThanks! Was also wondering - what if I want to accurately keep track of both my credit card spend and personal spend? Because the “expenses” summary would just include everything even if you key in the entire credit card spendLoh Tat Tian2w agoIf that's the case, use your bank app for the credit card spend to track. That's the most accurate imho. Then use seedly app for ""personal finance"". :P"
