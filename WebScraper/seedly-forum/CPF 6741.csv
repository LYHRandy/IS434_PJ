That is why retirement planning is very important. Even though now there is CPF Life which gives lifelong payout compared to the old CPF retirement sum scheme which will run out. It is still important to plan for retirement which you either maximize what you can get from CPF for your retirement or have multiple incomes when you retire and not just rely on CPF.0 comments1"
