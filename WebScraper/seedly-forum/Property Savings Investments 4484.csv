question,"Property Savings Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Sep 2018How can I maximise my CPF savings whilst planning a second property (EC) upgrade in 2 years time? What are the factors to consider?Me and my wife are currently in our early to mid 30s. Should we consider transferring the OA to SA, or top up the SA with cash? Or should we focus on paying off our current housing loan instead? What happens when we have reached the minimum sum? Will the additional cash from our monthly salaries earn the 4% interest? We intend to upgrade to an EC in 2 years time. Will we be considered a second time buyer under a bank loan? If so, what is the LTV? Can we claim back the ABSD?6 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018​Main Qs:How can I maximise my CPF savings whilst planning a second property (EC) upgrade in 2 years time?​This is not really possibe due to the fact that you are looking at EC as a 2nd ppty unless u are getting an EC which is already 10yrs old. (Not in the market yet bcos all are still new)​If you first ppty is a HDB, your 2nd ppty wun be an EC rather a Pte ppty instead.​Qs: What are the factors to consider?As mentioned, you can only get a PTE ppty and if your 1st ppty is already a PTE ppty, there is no way you can get at EC unless is 10 years old.​IF i get 50 upvotes for this reply , i will reply all the 7 Qs.0 comments3"

ProdigyAnswered on 26 Sep 2018Hi,​If you intend to upgrade to EC, you would be required to sell your HDB within 6 months of key collection of your new EC unit. There is no ABSD incurred for purchase of new EC since you are required to sell your HDB. Loan will still be considered as first housing loan (75%) since you are required to dispose your HDB after TOP of EC (ie. doesn't matter whether you have outstanding loan now or not). ​I would not encourage transfering your CPF OA to SA unless you are confident of paying the 20% downpayment of EC with your CPF OA even after the transfer. Either that, or you intend to use 25% cash in your downpayment for the EC. ​There are a few things to consider. If you don't require your CPF OA for the downpayment of EC (20%) and don't forsee yourself needing the cash savings, you can go ahead to transfer the funds to your SA. However, if you do intend to purchase a secondary property or upgrade in the future, you wouldn't be able to use your SA to finance the purchase! ​Personally, I would be more comfortable using my CPF OA to settle the 20% downpayment. I would not be so concerned in the accrued interest of the CPF OA as I know that the capital appreciation of EC would easily cover it!​Hope this clarifies most of your concerns! :)0 comments1"

MasterUpdated on 19 Oct 2018loanstry to draw down the bank loan to avoid double “penalty“ from both the bank and CPFCPFtopping up the SA from OA will give you more interest and you can use it to hedge against the bank loanTopping up voluntarily give you tax rebates - this is subjective and depends if you believe in the CPF system Long termToo many questions in one question >_< ending here0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 15 Sep 2018There's like 8 questions in this one question.If someone's nice enough to spend the time to answer them all, then great.But I would suggest you actually have a discussion with CPF, a Financial Advisor, and A Property agent you can trust to give you unbiased advice.Also, quite a lot of your questions have already been answered or have answers written online either through official channels, or through financial bloggers or people who have gone through the process. 0 comments1"
