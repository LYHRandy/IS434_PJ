1,"Jonathan Chia GuangrongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Aug 2018There are a couple of ways of going about it.​Consider creating portfolio of REITs and blue chip stocks based in Singapore. For REITS, average dividend yield vary by sector and is about 5%+ upwards.​As Gabriel has mentioned in another comment, you can look at dropshipping. However, this needs some leg work and at least some active monitoring, depending on how you approach it. Not to mention finding someone to guide you along. Few avenues available: Shopify, Ebay, Amazon. Amazon also has their Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) programme, where you ship stuff to their warehouses in the US and they will handle the sales and shipping / returns aspect for you. For the others mentioned, you will need to handle orders individually plus ordering from suppliers and shipping to the customers. ​IF you are feeling adventurous and are not risk adverse, look into the various investment programmes available. Pick one you feel most comfortable with to help you massively build your wealth. I looked into an options portfolio programme almost 2 years ago and am now getting an average of close to 5% per month returns on average year to date. 0 comments0"
