1,"Axib XnyLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated 21h agoProperty if not used as an asset, becomes a liability. So if I own a property, I will prefer to generate cashflow and future capital gains if possible.  The economics point of view. Home is where our loved ones are and is meant for staying in and creating memories. It need not be tied to a property, though in Singapore,  it conventionally is. The people maketh a physical home also 'home' in the emotional and mental sense. That said, I see HDB primarily as a home then secondarily as a possible investment asset. I won't want to use it as a base asset to flip property though I might explore to rent out some rooms or conduct lessons in the home or use it as a home studio. I will see other properties (second one,  private properties, freehold,  overseas) and REITs as investment instead. In a nutshell, I will only take risk on what I can afford to lose and not on what I cannot. One additional reason is that HDB, like CPF, is protected from bankruptcy claims. So the safety net is a draw to me as a good stable foundation,  at least for my lifetime.  PS: Stayed in three HDB units owned by my parents. Moved twice, once for downgrade, one for Sers.5 comments9"
2,See all 5 comments Basir Nazeer1d agoThis is so helpful. Thank you for sharing ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€Eng Soon Teo21h agoThat is precisely what I have in mind. Only risk what you can afford. My first home is definitely not the one.
3,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 2d agoBoth. For me, property is only an asset once you can monetize it. If not, you would just stay in it and pass your days doing what you'd like to do in the privacy of your home (I'd just read my books if I had the time)To view it as an asset class, it needs to generate returns. This could be in the form of rental, or profits due to capital appreciation (but only after I sell it, else it's all paper profits)If it's rental, then I'd need to deduct the costs involved. E.g. bills, fees, property tax, mortgage etc. If I'm receiving $2000/mth rental but paying $2000/mth mortgage, it probably doesn't cut it for me.As with REITs, it's about location and timing. I've seen clients unlock tremendous value after an area's valuation skyrocketed, but I have seen some whose housing value stagnated.0 comments7"
4,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated 1d agoMy home is NOT an investment. Period.Even if my home appreciate, and I can sell if for a capital gains, I still must buy a new home to stay in, right? So it is totally not able to provide any investment returns, since if I am staying in the same place, with the same convenience and space, I will probably have to fork out more money (and please, most homes in Singapore depreciate by 99 years to $0)Many people mistakenly think that they are improving their lives, because they sell off their 3bedders home, and then with the extra cash, upgrade to a more expensive home with THE SAME LENGTH OF PROPERTY LOAN.They are just increasing their loans and liabilities. There are some people who may downgrade their homes to a smaller size, or less convenient places for lower value, and getting the cash values out to live.That is not really an investment, ain't it? Its more like downgrading your lifestyle.You have worked 30, 40, 50 years of your life, why must you reduce your home space or reduce the convenience? You should be staying a better place or a more convenient place with your great returns from investments. You worked hard, you deserve it. =) A home is not an investment, if you want investment, go for 2nd property, go for stocks ETF, go for index funds.Only a 2nd property can be considered an investment, since only a 2nd property can be sold without the need to buy a new one.And of course, a 3rd, a 4th, 5th etc would be great ;)1 comment2"

6,"Toh You XinLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2d agoAs an investment:To rent out any extra room(s) to generate income.As a home:A location that is easily accessible by public transport, has amenities for lifestyle needs and able to meet family needs.0 comments2"
7,"Alvin TeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2d agoIt depends on how you use it. There is some gains from property especially if you purchase a BTO and eventually sold it. How much gains are those and whether there is remnants for cash (after accrued interest) still depends on how you finance the flat in the first place. Not to mention if youâ€™re only out to make money for it, your spouse may not share same sentiments as you. For me, home is where the heart is. Eventually itâ€™s the place my boy will mark his height year after year.I will not give that up just to make a few dollars, I said a few dollars because during my stay I incur utilities, tax, and many other intangibles. My answer is: itâ€™s more than a place to stay, itâ€™s a house I decide to call home0 comments2"
8,Wong JacksonLevel 2. RookieAnswered 11h agoIt's definitely an asset to me. My home is a dual key unit. I rented out the studio to cover my mortgage interest.

10,"V WLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2d agoHas to be both.My apartment is where my family stays. If one day I wish to move to a new place, hopefully, the value of this property would increase and help me to upgrade to a better one.0 comments1"
11,Jan SinLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2d agoIt is both a home as well as investment for me. This is because I can stay there and the value of the house will appreciate over time (depending on the economic situation) .0 comments1
12,"SashaLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2d agoBeing able to only buy resale HDBs, due to my PR status and current purchasing power, my primary view of my home is somewhere to stay.  While I hope it can also be a form of investment, the evolution of policies around HDB makes it seem to me that the future is uncertain.0 comments1"
13,"Jay Liu, Sleepyhead at Land of Dreams Level 6. MasterAnswered 2d agoEither.
If property is bought for hopes for selling when the property appreciate in the future and when there is and sold, it will be considered as an investment. If property is used to generate profits, e.g. rental, using as an office space, it will be viewed as an investment.
For me i will view my parent's home to be somewhere to stay. If i were own my own house i will consider it somewhere to stay too. Unless if i were to operate a own business from home or renting it out to have rental income, i will view it as an investment.0 comments1"
14,"Lydia KohLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2d agoI don't have a property yet, and while I hope my property will become an investment,  at the moment I view my first property as a place to stay. Investment properties such as condos are too pricey for us at the moment and too risky.0 comments1"
15,"Yusheng LiuLevel 2. RookieUpdated 2d agoFor my case, a property is both.I am staying in my own house now, so it is obviously a place to stay here.Meanwhile, I see this home as an investment tool too. I will state few reasons below,1) Singapore property market is stable. It won't go up and down crazy. That means the capital you invested won't be evaporated in a sudden. (But be aware of recession, it drops a lot in 2008 i could remember)2) Singapore property has relatively high rental/price ratio, which will give you about 3-5% if you are renting out a condo, or 6-8% if it is an HDB.3) Singapore has no natural disaster like tsunami, earth quake, which means the property is relatively safe compare to other market. (hope we will never be like HK now)0 comments1"
16,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Bachelor of Computing at National University of SingaporeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 2d agoI view my home as a place to live in and not as an investment. Having a home to live in is a need and not a want. Hence, there are many factors which are of higher priority than the potential price appreciation such as but not limited to:LocationHigh-floor or low-floorFlat type (4-room, 3-room, etc.)Surrounding amenities such as schools, coffeeshops and supermarketsSurrounding public transport0 comments1"
17,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 2d agoMy first property is an investment because I am not staying in. The price I paid for was undervalued and it is purely for passive rental income which I aimed to cover all expenses incurred (instalment, tax, and MISC fee). I set up my mind right from the start when shopping for property. This is important because I don't end up buying property i love (might attract premium) but property with good value. Besides, the tenant market for my property is rather simple which doesn't require massive renovation to impress them. So, minimum renovation cost to optimise the return. When the rental income becomes the steady stream of income in cash, I choose to rent property that suit my style and liking. I am blessed with my choices so far.0 comments1"
18,"Deryl HengLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2d agoBoth for me. Although I don't own my own home right now, I will always think through my purchase of my future home for stay through the lenses of both an Occupier and an Investor. As such, not only I will look out for common factors for occupiers such as Location, Affordability, Price/Valuation, Financing, but also to consider investment factors such as Volume/Activity in the market (ie: Liquidity of certain property types), Market/Property Cycle at point of purchase and even as macro as my own sentiment of the local property market in the next 10 years, at least. If I have the opinion that the property market at the point I am considering the purchase is not promising, I will even consider not purchasing a home there.So in short for me, when selecting my own home in the future, it will be determined through the confluence of factors from an Occupier and Investor perspective.1 comment1"
19,"San San2d agoIt will be a place for me to stay (for good where possible). The rate of appreciation may not seem as great as before, ""frying"" properties may no longer justify additional cost (such as repay grants with accrued interest, etc) and the efforts of house hunting/moving/renov/etc."
20,"Jacky YapLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2d agoActually I view our home (wife and mine) as an asset to stay.
I dont think it can be classified as an investment since its not income producing.
Even if we were to sell it, we would be using the proceeds to get another home to stay in.
While property value might increase and the difference in the purchase and sale price can be counted as a profit, by the time you upgrade to the second property, the PSF of the new place would have increased and the profit from the first property would now be used as the downpayment for the second property.
So while your ""property equity value"" increases, i cant really turn that equity into cash (you can but that's another topic). So I rather classify my home as just an asset under my balance sheet.
For properties counted as investments, those will be maybe overseas properties being rented out, which are income generating, and can be sold off and the proceeds can be used for other purposes (and not locked under housing equity).that's just my thoughts on how I view my current home and it's position on the balance sheet. :)1 comment1"

22,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 2d agoHas to be both. Property is an asset like a car is an asset.Yes, your residence is for personal use but its an appreciating asset rather than a depreciating asset like the car.You wouldn't buy a property without considering its resale value in the future if you decide to sell it or even its potential rental yield based on your area and nearby amenities.0 comments1"

25,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered 23h agoA home is a home, and will be an expense. After a few yrs of owning a rental property, IMHO1) rental yield is not good... At best, as good as a fixed deposit. I am getting better returns from my reits honestly. I can easily control my risks n returns w reits, and that includes mgmt to deal w the rental business. Would not ever want to buy a 2nd rental property ever.2) good capital appreciation is very dependent on factors, my feel is if it has less than 4 rooms, the demand goes down a lot. Good capital appreciation comes to the 5 rooms, good view, good location, best if its something in the league of James Dyson. Dont get a property and hope for capital gains, not worth the effort.3) Just take the home as a depreciating asset (like a car), focus on best value for decent cost, and one you would feel happy living in for years to come. The capital gain is really like an unrealized gain. Dont count on it to make money. Enjoy living in it.0 comments0"
