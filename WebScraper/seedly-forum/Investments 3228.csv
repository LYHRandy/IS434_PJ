1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Oct 2018I have 2 brokerage accounts, Lim and Tan which I've used for a number of years, and more recently maybank ke. The latter's interface is miles ahead, easier to use and less clunky, at least to me. A breathe of fresh air so to speak. Able to monitor all my accounts with them, including my monthly investment plan portfolio. Only thing I can't do is monitor my margin ratio using the app.. Hope this helps 0 comments0"
