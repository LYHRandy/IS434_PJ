MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Definitely, S&P 500 contains automakers (Electric Vehicles), agribusinesses(soybeans), and commodity companies (steel) that currently have been hit by the tariffs slapped on their exported goods between the 2 largest economies of the world. A Trade deal currently in the works involves the increased purchase by China of 100s of billions of dollars worth of American Goods, as well as America's soybeans, which China is the largest importer of.Expect Agribusinesses to profit, as well as EVs which the tariffs will most likely be lifted from. keep your eye on TESLA, since their push into China recently will be boosted by renewed diplomatic relations and removed tariffs on Model 3s.0 comments0"
