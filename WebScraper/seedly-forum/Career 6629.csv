1,"Elen WinataLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I was a foreigner on an S Pass previously too (now a PR). Working overtime without overtime pay is unfortunately very normal and unless the work contract states that extra pay will be given outside working hours, there's not much you can do.How long has your friend been in Singapore? Length of stay before applying for PR, current salary, as well as achievements in related field count towards getting the PR approved.2 comments2"

Unless he's in demand industries or of a certain position and above, it will be hard to be granted PR now. Even S pass application gets tougher each year. "
3,"As DfLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 25 Oct 2018Accounting firms are notorious for OT and unless he's an untrained bookkeeper or the like, he would be considered an executive and exempt from OT.The only difference S Pass makes is the difficulty in switching jobs but really, if he knows there's no progression and most have left, it's up to him to take ownership of his own career and renegotiate or move on.0 comments1"
4,"Tina Sharon LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 Oct 2018Accounting firms generally require employees to work long hours. That's a fact of life especially for fresh grads. It is a learning period so try to learn as much as he can whilst servicing his clients. However, he should look for another job if he thinks that he is being exploited and singled out. 
As for PR, it is pretty tough to get it nowadays.  So maybe look elsewhere.

It is a lot easier if married to a Singaporean/PR. Also if there were many viets who took up PR and went on to abuse it, they may grant lesser PR statuses to viets in general.If possible, look at a new job, but accounting firms are usually strife with OTs.0 comments0"
