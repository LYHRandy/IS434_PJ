1,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 30 Aug 2019It depends on your investment portfolio. If your underlying investments are based in foreign currencies, then it may make sense to hold multiple currencies. Most average retail investors at most would have 2 or 3 (maximum I feel) foreign currencies to hold for their investments, if they DIY-ing their portfolio.
Alternatively, you may be a globe trotter. Holding multiple currencies of your most frequent cities make sense as well.If you are in retirement and you are retiring in Singapore, then holding just SGD is fine. Do not really see the possibility of SGD collapsing. Touchwood.
