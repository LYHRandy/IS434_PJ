God of WisdomAnswered on 30 May 2019Right now, there are plenty of short term endowment policies giving pretty good rates for 3 year savings at 2.2% and above.SSB is at 1.88%. FD probably lower. If I need the money in that short amount of time, I wouldn't expose it to equity investments.0 comments4"

It is best to put them into a low risk financial instrument. As you have brought up, you can put them into Fixed Deposits, high yield savings account, short term
Endowment etc.High yield savings account should offer the best interests if you can hit their requirements.0 comments4"

If so, you will probably need to use this fund for repayment soon and it might be better to keep it liquid eg in a high interest savings account. you might get around 2% returns if you meet the requirements.note that redemption of ssb will take at least one month and money disbursed back to you on the first week of each month... so watch your timeline if u need the money for condo repayment soon.investment would be riskier and you can choose this option if this will be your net proceeds and you are not taking a loan for your condo.0 comments2"
