1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Mar 2019Google to see if there are reviews online.Even if there are reviews, check to see if it is a 'sponsored post' or 'sponsored review'Speak to friends and check out actual remedies that have worked for others. So I did a quick Google of said hair loss treatment, and it seems to be micrografts. Probably more effective than topical treatments, but comes at a price.All the best!0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Not sure what's good but do check out review by googling first as my friend told me those Yun Nan and London Weight management, what they do is get you to sign up on a fix cost say 3- 6k then during the treatment, keep getting the person who treat you to tell you more issue or problem then need to top up somemore but may not be true or may not be effective. Google or a check with CASE Singapore you'll find them with the most complain and many has ask CASE to help with refund of yet to consume package fees. So do observe longer and Google more. It pays to wait. Cheers.0 comments0"
