1,"Terence Tan, Finance at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Mar 2019It depends if you are experience investor or a newbie? But generally, shorts are ""short"". Short term, smaller and limited gains.For longs, they are generally ""long"". Longer term. Bigger and unlimited gains.Its easy to go from 100 to 0. But it is hard to go from 100 to 1000.With limited resources, I think retail investor should focus on longs only.0 comments0"
