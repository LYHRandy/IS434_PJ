1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 21 May 2019So I just came back from a week-long Kansai trip, and between my Dad and I, we managed to spend under S$1k!Here are some travel hacks:1. Osaka Amazing Pass: We bought the 3-day Osaka Amazing Pass, and were able to see plenty of attractions without paying for the entrance fee, as the 3-Day Pass covered it.  Even if you are not heading to Osaka, there are such tourist passes available in other parts of Japan (for eg. I used one for Haneda the last time).2. Book a hotel that has good breakfast. Sometimes, the different between a hotel with breakfast and without breakfast could be $5 per head. In such cases, I would opt for the breakfast. Super Hotel for eg. is a budget hotel which serves a really hearty breakfast (think warm scrambled eggs, saba fish, pork and lotus root stew, miso soup, steamed gohan etc), and our cost per night was $100. Really good value, and great for morning where we had to get up early, have a hearty breakfast and go right into checking out the country. 3. Youtrip.I just used Youtrip on my Japan trip, and found rates to be comparable to what I could get from the Raffles Place money changers.Another big plus - when I was out of JPY for a transaction, it converted my SGD to JPY. Which also means, no small change that I need to change back to SGD when I get back! For me, that's a nice plus since I typically don't like to change it back to local currency.Get S$10 free after your first top up with my referral link: https://youtrip.app.link/HUI%20JUN1288994. Lawsons is amazing for cheap food. AMAZING.Even when I have budget for 1,500 yen for a meal, I still LOVE Lawson's egg sandwiches. It's one of my must eats in Japan. I recently tried the Strawberry and Cream sandwich, and candidly, its much better than some of the hyped up desserts that are more expensive.I also get my beloved green teas and yogurt drinks from Lawsons. Good value.0 comments2"

That’s dependent on what you intend to do, and which part of the country you’re intending to visit. I did a 10 day West Japan trip there recently with my girlfriend and we definitely went crazy with the spendings. That being said we did rent a car there which made things more expensive. But exploring the ”off the beaten track” places really made the trip folds more awesome.Japan is poison to the wallet, food is fantastic and can rack up to more than a 1000yen per pax a meal, not considering if one has a taste for the finer stuff. Though options like Matsuya(highly recommended) or even stuff sold at the Lawson or 7-eleven’s are more cost efficient.  Being the land of merchandise, (almost) everything has a mascot and merch to go with, not to mention them limited edition collaborations that makes not pulling the trigger mad tough. We spent about 3K per pax for a hell of a fun trip that resulted in zero regrets and “oh I should have bought that” feels. Take it from me, bring more than you think you’d want to bring. You’ll be glad you did! *note: unless this is going to be a budget trip, bring more! 0 comments0"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If its excluding hotel and air ticket, its pretty good but it still depends on where you want to go, you have to do your own calculation based on the places you want to go and bring abit extra.1 comment0"
