1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Aug 2019Well, it depends on what boutique fund house? Some are so boutique that they only allow accredited investors willing to put in at least a few hundred K.Also, are they registered and licensed by MAS? You might want to check first. There are many investment scams originating from overseas such as land banking investment, invest in buying islands, invest in property overseas etc0 comments0"
