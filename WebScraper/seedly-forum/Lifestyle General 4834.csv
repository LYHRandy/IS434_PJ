1,"Fan ZDLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 23 May 2019I honestly think that most people get phones mostly for their function rather than as an investment. So existing users won't really be affected much in the near term other than perhaps a drop in trade-in value. Long term wise also dont think it'll be an issue. The Android ecosystem is pretty robust, lots of choices to select from.0 comments0"
