1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Hi there! Mortgages tend to have lower interest rates than margin rates and generally speaking, real estate prices have lower volatility than stocks. Additionally, real estate may be non-recourse, meaning that if the property fails, the bank can only go after the mortgage property and not your personal property. You can think of it this way, the bank cannot take away your house simply because the house dropped in value but on the flip side, the broker is able to take away your stock when the value drops. 0 comments2"

It is rare to see property price decrease more than 20% on a single day but it is a common thing in stocks where the price can tank by 20% or more on a single which lead to margin call.Hence, only leverage on asset that are predictable (Monthly rental income) and asset price that don;t fluctuate greatly (Does not drop more than 20% on a single day).0 comments0"
3,"DeleteEditKenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Real estate is an asset and thus can be used as a collateral which can be collaterised when taking a loan.What that means is that the value of the home is taken into account before disbursing a loan. And also this would further suggest that there is an easy way to understand how much loan value and whether you can payback (using your income, credit history etc) also known as a loan eligibility which is often done before getting a loan amount.For investing in stocks on the other hand, itâ€™s highly not advisable. This is called leverage, where you are investing money you do not have. And there is a chance you can lose it all. For example in the recent high profile hyflux case.0 comments0"
