Grand MasterAnswered on 02 Sep 2019If you have a large capital, the downside is market keeps moving up, and instead of a full lump sum, you are only dipping your toes.But then, the other side is true too... if the market slides down monthly, you will be glad you doing RSP.RSP will have more fees than a big lump sum now and then. I think if your RSP is $200 monthly and above, probably is fine. If your RSP is $50, maybe instead of monthly, maybe combine and do quarterly?0 comments0"
