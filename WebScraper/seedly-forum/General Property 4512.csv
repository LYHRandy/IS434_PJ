1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Wow. Congratulations for being able to Upgrade :)​Some analysis / costing below:​(1) OA:Combine income 10k, assuming both below 35 and assume salary 6k and 4k so CPF employer and employee is 37% Where 23% will allocate to OA means $510.60 and $340.40. So total monthly goes to OA is $851.​Combine savings 4k monthly and means OA since not much can keep In CPF as retirement earn 2.5+ interest or transfer to SA for 4%+ interest.​(2) Choices of Properties available:Stayed 5rm HDB, MOP 5 Years already passed in Jul 2018 so means can sell anytime.Monthly combine income 10k means can still choose either EC (combine income < 14k) or Private properties.(3) Price:EC: 3 bedroom about 800 to 950kCondo: 1 to 1.6 mil (non central condo)​(4) EC Cost EstimationExample by Seedly: https://blog.seedly.sg/property-cheat-sheet-bto-vs-resale-vs-ec-singapore/​** For the above example, as you're 2nd timer and from 5rm upgrade to EC, thus will not have the 30k housing grant. So after all the above deductions, payment, still have to service $541,300.Since EC can only borrow from bank, assume borrow for 25 years at 1.8%, monthly repayment will be about $2,422 which is quite comfortable for 4k savings to cover. Just that you need to sell current 5 rm HDB and be able to come out with cash /CPF of about 200k + 85k for the upfront payment.​Property Guru homeloan calculator: https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-repayment​(5) For Condo cost of say 1.1 mil of a 3 room unit, it's gonna be even more.See: https://propertynet.sg/cash-need-to-purchase-buy-private-residential-property/​Summary:(A) Total Cash & CPF required for the downpayment (Including stamp duties and other fees) is $252,400(B) Minimum Cash required for the downpayment (Including stamp duties and other fees) is $55,300​So the choices is yours, read up more at:(5) More on EC vs Private Condo:https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/bto-executive-condo-private-condo/​4 comments6"
2,"See all 4 comments Kok Koon21 Sep 2018nice! v good analysis. This analysis also assumes poster can keep job that long and economy and interest rates holds at current (peak of equity markets). For poster's considerationHC Tang21 Sep 2018Haha. Nobody can guaranteed jobs and interest rate forever.  Still have to keep investing balance savings for future and if lost of job, by then kids already grown up, just rent out room or downgrade to encash for retirement. "
3,"Siti PutriLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Firstly ask yourself why does after MOP means 'upgrade'?
What is your definition of 'upgrade'? Do you mean another HDB EA, EC, PC?
To get a bigger place or better facilities or just a status symbol.
Even if you think you can afford it, it goes back to your objectives of 'why'?If you have the answer to that, then work out your finances. Chances are you bought a BTO and received lots of grants. Do note that when you buy and sell, you have to pay back the grants to HDB and resale levy. In addition, if u will need to pay the CPF accrued interest back too.Next consider if you are getting private property will have higher deposit of 5% cash, 20% CPF to be paid to the bank supposing on mortgage. Plus stamp duty fees from 5% onwards in cash. If a PC minimum costs you $1mil, works out to at least $100k upfront cash and $200k in cpf at bare minimum based on a $1mil property. Have yet to consider the renovation and furnishings.Supposing this is no problem for you, then calculate on bank mortgage repayment. Supposing you took a $750k bank loan for 20 years on hypothetical 2.5% interest (bear in mind will increase), you need to fork out at least $3.2k per month. Hence since both only saving combined $4k, this only leaves you with $800 per month for emergency, retirement and kids in future. Plus in condo there will be average $300 monthly maintenance fees. Hence left with $500 monthly. So  ask yourself if this is something comfortable for you to commit to for 20years. Do bear in mind you might have future kids and ageing parents, which again will cost money.I am not trying to discourage or encourage, all I am saying is think through the practicalities, own objective and own affordability. Even if both of you can save $4k now, best to make goal plans of what you like to achieve with it, like early financial freedom etc. 2 comments4"
4,"Kok Koon21 Sep 2018Solid sharing! Exactly what's on my mind suppose I'm on my MOP year. FI vs condo. If it's 20 years ago, i'd say go for PC or EC. Now I'll go for REITS for my ppty portfolio. So much more liquid and no stress on the day-to-day. Status symbols can go out of the windowSiti Putri21 Sep 2018Indeed. Me too. I go for REITs. But I also do have overseas properties. I think in SG if really want to buy property, I think commercial property has better yield although shorter leasehold. "
5,"Kenichi Xi, nᴉʍ oʇ dǝnᴉʇsǝd 不能说的秘密 at Tag Team with Gabriel ThamLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Tbh,​A combined income of $10k with a saving of $4k means your expenditure is $6k.​Holding on to a 5 rm flat is a Good Investment when your expenditure is already quite high.​A Saving of $4k is a good start and you should cherish the good you already possessed to increase your savings and clear your debt if any.​Rather then thinking of doing an upgrade, you should focus on getting another property you might be staying in or a income generating asset.​Before you commit into such a huge investment, you should focus on your family planning and protection which is the true essential, esp with the cooling measures and a purchase into a 2rm condo or EC is actually a downgrade.​Only when your essential are covers with enough cashflow, you should just make the best of what you have now and focus on increasing both income rather then increase the debt levels with some profit from selling and buying which will incurred expenses like lawyer fee.​Hope my reply helps.​If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.​https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xi​Thank you.2 comments2"
6,Kok Koon21 Sep 2018$4k savings a month for 2 pax is really not a lot.Jessica Tan22 Sep 2018I totally concur w Kok Koon. With 10k combine stick to present home n don’t even think of upgrade to private. 
7,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Perhaps it is better to wait for a while and look around first if you are looking for private properties. My assumption is both of you are looking to upgrade to a private property. 0 comments1
