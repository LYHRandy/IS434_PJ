God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoHi, as you applied during IPO, it will show up in your CDP statement.This is because Vickers is a platform that you use to purchase shares. Take for example POEMS, if the transaction does not happen via POEMS, it won't be reflected. So this is probably the same for other brokers as well. If you bought and sold shares on POEMS, Vickers won't know about it, hence it won't show up. The reverse is also true.0 comments6"
