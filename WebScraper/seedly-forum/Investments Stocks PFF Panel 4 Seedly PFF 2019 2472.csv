1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 02 Mar 2019Let me start of with the loss part. How much loss before you sell?This is a question of risk tolerance and your own strategy. What does your strategy tell you? If you are a day trader/technical analysis trader, then you need to evaluate whether the current analysis is still valid. Let's say you buy on the analysis that it is uptrending stock. An example cut loss situation would be when the stock is unable to break new highs and breaks below the previous support low.If you are fundamentals investor, then check your analysis of the company. Was there any change in the financials that require you to re-evaluate if this is a good company to invest in.How much before you take profit?I would prefer to keep holding on till the analysis is no longer valid as well. If you are a funamental analysis investor, long term investor, then just hold on collect dividends or lock in your capital gains when you analysed that the stock is way overpriced.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 05 Mar 2019I understand that it sounds logical to go with a percentage made and percentage loss basis. But that's not what usually happens. Most grab small % of profits and only surrender when its huge % of losses.There are many trading philosophies but I have a scenario for you to think through. Imagine you owned this stock Best World. If you check up the recent prices, the original % projection to take profit and sell would have been blown out of the window simply with volatility and a gap in price movements. How to react then??For long term investing from a portfolio perspecive, I've an answer in this video sharing ""When to sell from equities""0 comments0"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 05 Mar 2019I would think that knowing the reason to why you bought the stock and what investment strategy you have adopted is quite important also. Once, the ""why"" is there, I believe that answering the ""when"" is a lot easier, since your decisions are guided by your underlying investment principles, risk profile and reasons / thesis for buying the stock.Although most people (including myself), would not want an answer that starts with ""it depends..."", i feel that this kind of response is better rather than giving some hard and fast number on when you should buy and sell. Personally, I feel that numbers are just representing sentiments, which are tied to events going on in reality. Finding out the reasons which drives those numbers to me seems more important than just fixing a number and then playing hard and fast with it.You can check out this article also!https://www.wikihow.com/Know-When-to-Sell-a-Stock0 comments0"
4,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Mar 2019You should sell based on the methodology that you used to buy that stock in the first place.Eg. if you bought it cos of its dividend yield, then it might be good to sell when the yield drops or when you foresee the company running into financial troubles ahead which would make them unable to continue their dividend payments. example to look at: Starhub.If you bought because it was undervalued, then you should sell at fair value or when prices are overvalued.If you bought because it was a growth stock you have confidence in, then why sell? Unless the growth has stopped, or you made a mistake in the first place.Also sell when your original thesis is no longer valid, or when you discover a mistake.0 comments0"
