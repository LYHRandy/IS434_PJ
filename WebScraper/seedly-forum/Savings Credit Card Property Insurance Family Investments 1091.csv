1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 28 May 2019We are comparing the Singapore market to the US market, so there are many different factors that we need to consider here. For eg, do they have subsidies for newly married couples who want to buy a flat and have not hit the joint income ceiling; what are loan rates like etc etc.0 comments2"

Good debts such as Mortgage. Even if you have the cash now, do you want to pay everything to your mortgage and be left with no cash? You wont want to do that because cash flow is king. However, if you do have credit card or personal loans that are charging ridiculous interest, you should pay it off first. So it really depends on what type of debts you are talking about.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 28 May 2019Hi Anonymous, I follow Dave Ramsey abit and I find most of his suggestions too conservative.If it's ""no debt first then saving"", most would not be able to buy a house in Singapore. I don't know about you yet but at least I couldn't.
If you look at baby step 1 and baby step 3 of your post on Dave Ramsey, he has it as emergency savings. He even has multiple videos of it and preaches it as a necessary cost (like an insurance).I would rather recommend focusing on having an opportunity fund if you want to grow wealth and build passive income. For anyone with savings difficulties then creating forced savings is more effective then attempting to built emergency savings.If you are keen to find out more, I've a full explaination on the steps, watch EMERGENCY FUND IS UNNECESSARY (Create passive income with this focus instead!)

FreshieUpdated on 28 May 2019Hi,We have discovered him about a few months ago and we are doing BS 2 which will be finished by the end of this year.Some of the concept that he has provided do work in Singapore as well but it is not that magnify e.g. BS 5: The paying off your house early.Government has been telling us to buy a house that is within our budget, but it is not magnify as well.Some of us have the concept that it will be paid off but probably after 10 years, using what ever is in the CPF since we can't touch them till we are so much older or wait till 1 of the spouse passed away and the house payment will be gone too (my mom generation have this thought).0 comments0"
