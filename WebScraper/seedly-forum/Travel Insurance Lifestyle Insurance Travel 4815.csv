Grand MasterAnswered on 31 May 2019If your company HR is getting the travel insurance for you guys during the worktrip, its best to check with them if they can extend the days for you while you just pay the differences. Some company is able to do that.Otherwise if you want to be safe and not go through so much hassle, you may want to just cover the whole trip.0 comments1"
