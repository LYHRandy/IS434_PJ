1,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 27 Jun 2019Crypto markets are very volatile. What I can suggest is that you trade crypto-fiat pairs instead eg BTC/USD and XRP/USD, which will be relatively more stable as compared to BTC pairs. Systemwise, you can trade with a combination of TA(MACD, RSI, Hull Indicator) and FA(Buy the rumor and sell the news). Volume is also a key indicator. All the best for your crypto journey!0 comments3"
2,"Mike Ferrer, Head Of Community Management at TenXLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 20 Aug 2019A fairly straightforward system I use is to basically buy and hold. I know boring right? Time in the market beats timing the market. Only put in what you can afford to lose. Educate yourself, learn as much as you can about Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies and only put in small amounts, call it ""beer money"" if you will. Test the waters. Don't go wild.Some exchanges that you can use fairly easily in Singapore are:Gemini: https://gemini.com/Binance Singapore: https://www.binance.sg/enCoinHako: https://www.coinhako.com/Also, I would recommend storing your coins outside of exchanges using a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-sSince you asked for a system, a slightly more advanced way to do some investing systematically or cost averaging is to build a sort of crypto index. I use a few products such as: https://www.hodlbot.io/ - A customizable cryptocurrency trading bot that enables users to index the market, create custom portfolios, and automatically rebalance their cryptocurrency portfolios.https://www.iconomi.com/ - Crypto funds that are managed and picked by experienced investors. You can pick which strategy you like. It's basically an index of different cryptos.Additional reading that I found really useful when I started on my journey here:https://www.hodlbot.io/blog/ultimate-guide-on-cryptocurrency-indiceshttps://www.hodlbot.io/blog/constructing-cryptocurrency-indicesGood luck!0 comments1"

I'm not a fan of anything passive but if it's your thing, the GVT project is a good 15 minute read.1 comment0"

You'd probably need only a day to buy and set up."
