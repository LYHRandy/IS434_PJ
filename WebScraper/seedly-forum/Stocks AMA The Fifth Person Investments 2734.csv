question,"Stocks AMA The Fifth Person Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Feb 2019Is Singapore's Stock Market still viable and vibrant for investments, given that it's equity cap is shrinking?I've recently came across various reports stating that Singapore's number of delisting is higher than it's IPOs, meaning that the number of companies listed in the SGX is falling. Not only that it's equity cap is shrinking, with even our own homegrown tech company Razer Inc opting to list in the HKSE. Should we be concerned?3 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Yes I believe SGX is still relevant as ever. Companies opting to shift to HK is probably due to a multitude of strong selling points of HK market- little capital regulations, lowest corporate tax rates, relatively large share market cap in Asia, close proximity & increasing ties of China's markets, just to name a few.These do not change the fact that there are still plenty of investment opportunities available within SGX, coupled with our existing strong suits- stable exchange rate and consistent modest economic growth, both of which have shown to attract foreign investors looking for safe havens to park their money.0 comments2"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Hi! Regarding this issue, it is my opinion that the shrinking of SGX's equity cap is not necessarily a bad thing. The market is quite an efficient machine, creating new potential listings and removing those who are not up-to-par/ inefficient from the competition. Essentially, you can almost think that it is a method of removing ""bad"" investments from the Public Stock Market. Several of such ""delistings"" are due to companies that flout SGX rules and regulations for listed companies as well, hence delisting such companies are ensuring that the market stays competitive and efficient without alot of lagging components. Of course, this does not mean that all delistings are due to the fact that companies are not doing well, but instead could be because of the lack of trading volume or liquidity in the SGX, or low valuations. An example of such a company is OSIM, which delisted from SGX in 2016 even with a positive growth outlook.
