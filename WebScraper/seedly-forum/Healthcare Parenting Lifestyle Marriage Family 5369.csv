WizardUpdated on 28 Sep 2018Congratulations! :): ​For cash back with no caps, go for Amex True Cashback card.​https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/content/true-cashback-card/?sourcecode=A0000EUPTJ&cpid=100301242&veid=sI3ZX35Kd%7cdc_pcrid_278583159244_plid__kword_american%20express_match_e_pgrid_35256418218_ptaid_kwd-19866590_slid_u5JGN5Av&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItOqpj_nc3QIVFwSRCh2K9AHREAAYASACEgLpzfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds​just nice, your medical / health expenses can be charge using the first 6 months, get 3% cash back, up to 5k. Hence you charge 5k to this card and get $150 for the first 6 month. Subsequent fee , you can charge $700 (min spending) with BOC family visa card, spend on medical / healthcare fee to get 5% cap at $40. So you can spend $800 to get $40 cash back.http://www.bankofchina.com/sg/bcservice/bc1/201605/t20160503_6891836.htmlT&C at:http://pic.bankofchina.com/bocappd/singapore/201803/P020180327710875490784.pdf​With above 5k + $800 gets $150 + 40 = $190.​Any other expenses you can continue to charge on the Amex True Cashback card since it has no caps and get 1.5% cash back.​Alternatively you can charge also on Standard Chartered Unlimited Cash back card which gives also 1.5% cash back with no caps and other string of benefits. :)​That should cover most of your hospital / healthcare spendings.​Happy Parenting! :) 0 comments1"
