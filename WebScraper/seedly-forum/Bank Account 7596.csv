1,Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Aug 2018I think the answer depends on whether you would need the money soon or not. Cimb gives you 1% interest with flexibility to withdraw anytime without penalty (as long you leave $1k inside) and citibank Maxigain gives you 1.2% to 2.4% (after a year) but there's penalty of drop of counter if you withdraw the amount.If I need the money in the near future (less than 6 months) I will put in cimb fast saver. But if I don't foresee a need for it beyond 6 months I will put in citibank Maxigain. 0 comments1
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Aug 2018CIMB FastSaver is hassle free but if you have the time to transact online and be sure your savings grow monthly, Citi MaxiGain would be better in the long run.​Do note the interest rates for Citi MaxiGain will fluctuate every month - it's base interest rate is 80% of 1-month SIBOR!0 comments0"

4,"Randall TanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 23 May 2018It depends on your age too. If you are below 55 years old, then go with CIMB Fast Saver because there are no strings attached. But if you are above 55 years old, I would suggest putting inside CPF account, you can earn a higher interest rate. (Provided you have set aside the FRS.)https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Assets/members/Documents/CPF_Retirement_Booklet.pdf0 comments0"
5,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 22 May 2018I prefer the CIMB fast saver because there are no special terms and conditions to get the 1% interest rate.​With the citi maxi gain, you have to ensure you keep getting the bonus counters every month to get the higher interest rate. Any sudden withdrawal will affect your bonus interest rate.0 comments0"
