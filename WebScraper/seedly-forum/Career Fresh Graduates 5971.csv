1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2018Im planning to save 12-15k in NS. Then use it to invest. From there after ns, i will work hard and save to increase the amount i can invest every year. You can start working even sign on is an option if you want to. Then you can go for part time degree or just work normally to save and invest. Its not a must to have degree even though nowadays its good to have. You have to plan it out, its your life and future.0 comments1"

Take on a bank loan and try to clear off before you grad in 3 to 4 years, maybe teach tuition or do a weekend job if you can. Goodluck! 0 comments0"
5,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2018Take up a bank loan to fund your degree first. Save up as much as possible during NS and try to work part time (tuition etc.) during your free time when pursuing your degree. Then try to pay off your study loan as soon as possible to reduce the amount of interest payable. The best solution would be to pay in full before graduation as it'll still be interest free since it only kicks in after you graduate. Alternatively, you can ask your parents to help you pay first and you'll repay them every month etc.0 comments0"

If you can apply for financial assistance during your stay in NS apply it. You'll get more than your normal pay. If you're risk adventurous you can consider trying to find cash jobs, provided you have a soft copy of your IC which will make it easier. 0 comments0"
