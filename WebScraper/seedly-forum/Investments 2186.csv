1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 12 Mar 2019EBITDA is sometimes used as a proxy for a company's operating cashflows, since non-cash expenses are excluded, as well interest payments that may be grouped under financing cashflows. So in some respect, EBITDA margins can be an indication of the amount of operating cashflow that the company generates from every one dollar of revenue it earns. EBITDA margins, like EBITDA, can help us to compare different companies that may have different accounting treatments or capital expenditures. Companies with different capital structures can also be compared, since interest expense is affected by the level and type of debt that you have.0 comments1"
