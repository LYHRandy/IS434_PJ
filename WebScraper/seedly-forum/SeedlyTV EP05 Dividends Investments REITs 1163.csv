WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Let me give an example here:Let's say the dividend is $1 per share.If the price is $100, the dividend yield is $1/$100 = 1%If the price is $200, the dividend yield is $1/$200= 0.5%So the amount given is the same but based on the share price the % or yield changes.1 comment2"
