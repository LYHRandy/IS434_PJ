There’s a lot of industries you can look into like what Leonard has shared.After which you can select a few companies to deep dive into and understand more before making any decisions. it would also be good to take into considerations your own preferred form of investing whether you’re more towards a growth or income/dividend strategy. considering the macro conditions of the economy will help a little too.wishing you a wonderful investing journey ahead!0 comments2"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Mar 2019I would recommend a good spread of industries with different market sensitivity(best measured using a stock's beta).You will definitely want to include some defensive industries- basically businesses which generate very stable cashflows and produce necessities and essentials consumers and businesses require regardless of economic situation. Telecomms, Utilities, Consumer Staples, REITs. are popular choices. For people who are tech believers, I would say Cybersecurity is pretty defensive although I am not sure if current market information would agree with me.  I would be very careful about Energy although as core energy prices tend to follow inflation levels of the country.Cyclical stocks wise, I think you should have no problem. Almost every other sector out there is considered cyclical.  Theoretically, the average of your portfolio beta is the market risk you want to be exposed to. Practically speaking I would just make sure I am well diversified and rebalance heavier towards defensives when market outlook is poorer.0 comments1"
