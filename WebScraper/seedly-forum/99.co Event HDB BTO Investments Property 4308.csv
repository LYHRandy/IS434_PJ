WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi, Douglas here, 2nd Keynote Speaker.If you were to sell it to fund your next property, I assume you are going to stay in that ""next"" property too. Yeah, many Singaporeans do that. Since selling a BTO  after MOP of 5 years ""gtes"" a profit. You can use it to upgrade to a private property.But that said, your life plans may change or circumstances change, so you might acutally prefer to stay on your BTO even after 5 years. For example to be close to ageing parents or to be within 1 km of your child's future pri school. ​​​
