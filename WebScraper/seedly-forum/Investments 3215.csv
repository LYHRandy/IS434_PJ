1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Oct 2018Always read up first and do your homework/due diligence before investing. Ensure that you have a set of emergency funds first before investing and only invest with money that you can afford to lose. For a start, you can consider investing in the Nikko AM STI ETF through POSB's RSP InvestSaver. Can invest as low as $100 per month. Alternatively, you can consider trying out robo advisors like Stashaway or Smartly. 0 comments0"
