question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Nov 2018I was recently promoted, but I keep making mistakes in my new responsibilities. My colleagues are also much more experienced than me.

Talk to your manager, work with them to create a 6 month action plan to develop your weak areas and enhance your strengths. Foster a good working relationship with your more experienced colleagues and ask them for tips on how to improve. Show them you're willing to learn and prove that you deserve that promotion. Self-doubt can often lead to self-sabotage so be careful about that. Good luck and keep going!0 comments4"

GeniusAnswered on 07 Jan 2019In a healthy work environment, your colleagues more familiar with the tasks in your new role should help you. But let's work on things that you can control. Why are you making the mistakes? What could help you make less mistakes?Do you need specific training? Then ask your boss for the training. Or ask your colleagues nicely for help.Are the new instructions tricky to follow? Sometimes old SOPs passed down from long ago can be confusing.  Would it help to set aside time to come up with an updated SOP or a checklist? (Updating such stuff for the organisation could prove to be another boost for your performance review)Are you learning from your mistakes? This could be very task-dependent so I'm just making general statements. If yes then you're fine, hang in there. If not, i honestly don't think going back to the old role is a good idea because your boss obviously thinks you're better than that. Is there a lateral role that might suit you better? Same ""level"" of stuff that you're doing after promotion, but you may be better at that. If so, maybe ask for some exposure and consider a transfer?0 comments0"

The hawker selling char kway teo also took years to perfect his skills in order to attract the crowd. Give yourself time and space to learn. 0 comments0

6,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Nov 2018I've recently read about the Peter Principle:  “every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence”. It is satire and mocks management systems. Economists Alan Benson, Danielle Li and Kelly Shue published a paper which which provided evidence that the best salespeople were more likely to be promoted, and that they were then terrible managers. The better they had been in sales, the worse their teams performed once they arrived in a managerial role. Don't feel dejected about your inabilities, it could be due to skills mismatch. Take sometime to adjust to your new position, and you can always seek help from your colleagues and prove your boss wrong!0 comments0"
