Having to save on premium might mean that you're spending too much on other stuff? If you're interested I can intro you my agent l. He's done a pretty good job so far. Not too pushy either.0 comments0
2,Benjamin TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 04 Jun 2019It is a dated policy. AIA shield plans provides daily cash for hospitalization stay. Maybe consider using the funds to upgrade your current policy(if possible) or consider other polices to supplement your coverage.0 comments0

God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Yeah it's really an affordable policy but it's not a necessity, more of a good to have.For hospital income, your shield plan rider may have that benefit and if you a PA plan, it may include that as well. So it's up to you. If I can afford it, I'll just keep it as an in case. It may help pay for some misc expenses.0 comments0"
