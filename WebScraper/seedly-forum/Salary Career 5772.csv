question,"Salary Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Dec 2018My job pays well, but the management is extremely unreasonable. Should I start looking for a new job?I used to love my job, but when my new boss came it, he constantly expects me to reply emails after work hours, calls me when I'm on my leave to ask my why my desk is messy (There were things delivered there, but I wasn't there to receive it). I also have the liberty to give offs to my subordinates, but he has also taken away that right.9 answersAnswerBump0"

Sometimes, we really need to explore. And many times, I have friends' or mine experience telling me, there are blessings come in disguise of unfortunate events. 0 comments3"

I doubt there will be much upside in this role unless he quits or gets fired or is moved to another dept. So best to look for better opportunities after collecting bonuses etc. At the end of the day your happiness matters most! Good luck!0 comments2

It means he is out to get you, beyond being a normal prick. Suggest you find another job since a manager who is out to get you will affect your promotion chances in the long run anw. If u can get one high.paying job, you can get another similar one. Dont give up.Also try not to burn bridges on ur way out - u may want to return some day.0 comments2"

Replying emails after work hours seem to be a norm most of my career, but there also comes a point when you know that it's time to consider looking when your team members have the exact same sentiments, and have left because of that.0 comments1"
5,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 12 Dec 2018That sounds like over micro-management to me, and most probably trying to make your life tough as well. If you find yourself not enjoying what you do anymore, perhaps it's time to begin looking out for other opportunities. It's tough sometimes to make a decision to leave a job that you've come to love, trust me. But sometimes, certain factors don't allow us to perform to the best of our ability. Mismanagement is common, but management themselves failing to notice that makes the environment uncondusive. Think it through! Make a decision and move on! All the best!0 comments1"

7,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Dec 2018No harm looking for new opportunities. Update your linkedin, send out some resume, etc. You can always decide again when an offer comes. You'll never know that u will get.0 comments0"
8,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Dec 2018I think being happy or at least not annoyed at work is important for your mental health. If you boss is the cause of your unhappiness then I believe the next best way is to move on. There will be better companies and bosses out there0 comments0"
9,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Dec 2018Sorry to hear about your new boss. If you like the work you're doing now, i.e. the problem is just the boss and not the company, then maybe find a way to feedback about this issue. The ideal would be that your HR dept exerts some influence to improve your boss' management style, and the story ends happily ever after. However, not all companies have a sufficiently influential HR dept, so this doesn't always work and your career development could be affected if your boss takes your feedback as a ""sabo"" to him.If you like the company but just wanna escape from this boss, is there another role in the company that you can and want to try? The pay usually stays, assuming you transfer at the same rank. An internal transfer is usually good for personal growth, because you gain exposure to other departments of the company. Do some homework first to see if new boss at new department is better.Leaving should be your last move i think.   Because you won't know if you will like the new boss at the new company, and it's hard to find out. Unless you manage to get sth even higher paid, which then you must weigh if a bad boss is worth it. So like another commenter shared, dont burn bridges when you leave your current place, cuz maybe you might make a u-turn.All the best!0 comments0"
