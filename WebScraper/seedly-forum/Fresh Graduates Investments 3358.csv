1,Jay LiuLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018My first investment was NikkoAm STI ETF. Started with $100 a month and now higher. I'll still invest in STI ETF but will invest way higher as it reach 3.70+ at one point in time. 0 comments1
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Didn't do any investing until I graduated and became a financial planner. Bought a ilp back then, with about 100 per month. Switched funds multiple times since.. On hindsight, I would have saved more before buying into reits in a lump sum. There were nothing like posb investsaver or maybank ke's monthly investment plan back 10 years ago. Maybe Philip securities' monthly share builder plan was available back then, but the fee was quite high. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018The first investment I made was through a robo advisor, Smartly as it caught my attention of being able to invest outside of the Singapore market along with low fees. If I were to make my first investment again today, I would set up a RSP (POSB investsaver) to DCA into STI ETF along with Stashaway and Smartly0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 15 Sep 2018My first investment was to buy STI index 3 years after graduating cos at that time I didn't know anything and my uncle said they were good for dividends and stableðŸ˜‚ I wish I started earlier though! I still think STI index is a good buy so I would do it again, or start earlier with a regular savings plan! 0 comments0"
