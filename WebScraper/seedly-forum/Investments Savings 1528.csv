1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Hello!I agree that the internet has too much information and it gets rather overwhelming. I think that you should read the seedly blogs if you havent as it provides a comprehensive guide on investments for beginners!If you are looking for some basic monthly investment, I that you can try looking at Regualr Savings Plan (RSP) or Robo advisors.RSP allows you to invest with just a minimum amount of $100. What the RSP does is that it would help you to invest in the STI ETFs. STI ETFs consists of 30 STI stocks represent five different sectors and 19 different industries, chosen to best depict Singapore’s diverse economy. This would alson enable you to develop a rather diversified portfolio. By investing a monthly sum, you are essentially engaging in dollar cost averaging, whereby you will be purchasinh these stocks at an average price in the long run. Another area that you can try our would be robo-advisors. Robo advisors also does monthly investments with no minimum sum for certain companies.  This roboadvd, advice is generated according to algorithms which have been devised based on the company’s own knowledge of markets and investing.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Hi Kavita, some quick easy to understand pointers when it comes to investing.Invest globally.Don't time the market. Stay invested instead. Invest for the long term. You can easily set up a globally diversified portfolio through online providers or traditional Independent Financial Advisor Reps like myself. I have a simple ABCD framework to explain asset allocation and shifts in your portfolio as we get closer to retirement. Also, I am a strong believer in building income accumulation alongside asset accumulation so that dividends from your portfolio can help you retire a little more every month. It's important to understand where your money is going to and how it's being managed. All the best. :)0 comments1"

You can also read up on NIKKO AM STI ETF (average return about 3%). Its easy to start because you don't really need a trading account for RSP. You just need to have a bank account. You can also consider saving the $500/month into CIMB fastsaver (1% P.A) for a few months and buy Singapore Savings Bond (SSB ~2% returns).0 comments1"
