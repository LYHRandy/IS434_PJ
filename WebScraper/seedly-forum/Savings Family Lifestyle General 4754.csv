MasterUpdated on 08 Jul 2019I am not a parent yet but for most of my clients and friends, they do give monthly allowances to their parents. it may not be alot of money but its a token of appreciation and gratitude to their parents for bringing them up to the man/woman they are today.For some, since their parents are still working and would most likely just keep the money in the bank account, instead of giving them cash, they help their parents invest the 'monthly allowance' for their retirement!2 comments0"
2,"Charmaine Ng08 Jul 2019I helped you to ask my mother and yes she expected to receive monthly allowances. However because she cannot manage the finances ðŸ˜‚ I ended up not giving her the allowances and instead buy the things she needed.

If she is on a trip or something then I'd help to exchange the money and give to her and/or pay for the necessities like flight and accommodations.Charmaine Ng08 Jul 2019Also I pay for all the insurances/groceries at home so yes, she pretty much doesn't lack anything."
