FreshieAnswered on 06 May 2019Not a financial advisor, so commenting from point of common folks.I know of people who never venture beyond SG because they are uncomfortable with the unknown and think SG market “safer”. Also know people who only do overseas trading because SG market too boring for them.Do note these are comments from common folks and not financial professionals. In Essence, Just do what you feel comfortable with, after proper research. Buy overseas after you check and is comfortable that the stock is right. Don’t stop yourself for a reason like “i haven’t made my Sg portfolio big enough.”0 comments0"
