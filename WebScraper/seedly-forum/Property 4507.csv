#1 LTV which capped the max possible loan amount

ProdigyAnswered on 27 Sep 2018Hi, the recent changes in the Loan-To-Value ratio was from 80% loan to 75% loan and it only applies to bank loans. This means that if you intend to buy a HDB using HDB loan, you can still loan up to 90% at 2.6% interest.​As Kenichi correctly pointed out, your age matters a lot in the computation of the loan amount. ​HDB Loan​Since the loan tenure is at 25 years, the amount of loan is the same until age 40.Monthly Income: $4,000MSR (30%): $1,20090% Loan: $239,000Max Property Price: $265,000 based on 90% loan​Bank Loan (purchasing HDB)​For this case, I assume you intend to loan for 25 years at 75% loan of the property price.

Assuming you are single, 35yrs old, based on ur $4k salary.The BTO is assumed to be priced at $239, 000​Without debt or including cpf, the estimated maximum amount you can borrow for BTO HDB flat is $319600 at TMSR 30% (for HDB or EC purchase only) and TDSR 30% (for all ppty type) for a Tenor of 25yrs.​The above calculations shows if you are single, got debts or bad credit score, you might not be able to borrow a decent amount.​Cpf will play a good part in helping you getting your loan and with Cpf grants.What we can learn from the above is,​Get married with a spouse with cpf tt can help getting a loanDun get into any debts before any ppty loanNumber of Credit cards and late payment will upset ur credit score that stays for 3 yrs.Increasing your income but make dure the combined income with ur spouse still allows u to get a BTO or EC.if you are getting PTE ppty, your current status is not eligible.​You can use this calculator as a guide when the need arise.https://uniservices1.uobgroup.com/secure/online_tools/calculators/TDSR/index.jsp​Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.2 comments1"
