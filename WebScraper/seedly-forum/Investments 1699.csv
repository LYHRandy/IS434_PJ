It will be best if you like the work you are doing too.Do you have any specific set of skills? Such as copyrighting,lifesaving for events, photography, etc. These skills will be able to give 15/H.Alternatively you can be a private tutor tutoring Secondary school kids or even list your skills on fiverr.Also it is good to invest in yourself to learn a new skill to generate side income. There are various courses on that. You can google it up.0 comments3"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Apr 2019Here are some ways:Private tuition - definitely more than $15 an hour. You will also learn how easy it is to understand a concept yourself, but difficult to get someone else to understand it. Work out instructor - if you are able to (and also qualified), teaching group classes would pay more than $15 an hour. I think this spans anything from yoga to HIIT to zumbaDog walking - apparently it pays anywhere from $13-25 per walkOn a same thread - pet sitting. Said to pay $15 an hourIf you are skilled in video editting/photoshop/graphic design - take up projects on the sideLikewise for writing good copy0 comments1"
