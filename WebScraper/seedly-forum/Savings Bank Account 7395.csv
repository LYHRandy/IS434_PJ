1,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019With a Private Banker with a lot of private placement, some in properties (SG and overseas).If we are looking into Minister kind of pay capability, they could be consider HNWI and the options they have are boundless, each investment might be in millions. The answer is always a mixture , both in Singapore and offshore although it doesnt really feed your curiosity. Everyone have a different game plan and some might be heavily into stocks , some in property (SG/overseas), etc. But they shouldnt differ too much on the types, except for the weightage. Like I would expect most HNWI would have a few ULs policies.0 comments4"
2,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 12 Jun 2019It depends on how they use their pay. There are people earning  a million a year but only have 50-100k cashflow surplus while some earns 200k and have 50k to 100k surplus too. As for ultra High-Net Worth individuals, their monies will definitely be diversified across the 6 major asset classesCash
Bonds
Equities
Commodities
Properties 
Insurances/UL0 comments3"

Many people with high salary have high expenses resulting in them being wealth poor. You might be surprise, but many rich people that I encounter with high wealth have ordinary salaries. But it one thing for sure, people with high wealth, mostly put them into income producing assets.0 comments2"

WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jun 2019They definitely understand diversification and allocate their assets in different areas - stocks, mutual funds, insurance, vehicles, real estate, business interests and many others. Each of them are of different asset class that serves different purposes. So each person’s % allocation will vary. Like maybe life insurance for leveraging, stocks for liquidity etc. Each asset class has its pros and cons so generally see how’s the person’s risk appetite.0 comments1"
