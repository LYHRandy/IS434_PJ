1,"Adrian Goh Jun Wei, Product at NodeflairLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 3w agoI have been using it for most of my online paymentsWhat I like about itIt's as seamless as the usual debit cardYou get GrabRewards points! As a Grab platinum user, it's 10points/dollar. So if you purchase a $200 headphones, you get 2k points, which is equivalent to a $5 ride voucherHow it can be improvedAuto top-up feature. Right now it's a debit card, so for a big-ticket purchase, you have to top up the GrabPay first. However, this isn't a huge deal-breaker in any way, just a slight inconvenienceI am definitely waiting for the physical card to be released so that I can use it offline to get more perks like cashback from ShopBack Go and getting GrabReward points for day-to-day purchases!0 comments2"

The good part is that you can use the card for online shopping that doesn't offer GrabPay. So for me, I used it for Shopee and got grabpoints for it. So if you do some sort of online shopping that doesnt offer grabpay as payment, it would be pretty good. Now UOB and Grab partner up, so you can get up to 10% cashback with UOB one credit card as well so it will be even better to topup grab wallet with UOB one credit card and then pay with grab mastercard. Up to 10% cashback and up to 10x grabpoints.0 comments0"
