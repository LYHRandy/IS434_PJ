1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 30 May 2019Business ProfileSource: The Edge Markets HMI has different medical centres such as Mahkota Medical Centre, Regency Specialist Hospital and HMI Institute of Health Sciences in Malaysia. They also invested into the Starmed specialist centre that is located in Singapore as a majority shareholder. The bulk of revenue comes form the Specialist Hospital and medical centre. The new centre in Singapore is expected to generate losses after a period of gestation. Revenue growth over the last few years have been quite positive, with the profitability of the business being quite strong.  What seems healthy is also how operating income margins have improved over time, which is a testament to improving the profitability of the firm. On the downside, however, revenue growth is slowing down. Sales/Capital ratio have also fallen over time, which indicates that to grow, more reinvestment would be needed which would reduce cash flows. The Malaysian Private Healthcare industry is likely to see growth in the next few years. This is likely due to an increase in medical tourism, the ageing population as well as government policies to encourage more citizens to seek medical check-ups and treatments.  Higher importing costs due to a weaker ringgit is also likely to drive up costs and reduce operating margins. Projected Revenues With this brief profile in mind, I projected revenues at a slower growth rate than before. I projected revenues for the next few years with the basis that the new specialist centre would increase revenues while bearing in mind that revenue growth in the Malaysian markets is shrinking. After the initial few years, I allow revenue to grow at a much slower pace, as IHH has conquered greater market share. I do not think that revenue can grow much since the private healthcare market in Singapore is already competitive. Moreover I would prefer to be much more conservative in how I project revenues to give myself a margin of safety. In fact, by 2024, I hold that revenue will not grow any further. Operating Income MarginsAs management had explained, the opening of the new outlet in Singapore would lead to a decrease in margins as there is an upfront cost incurred. Because of this, I reduced operating income margins to 15% from their previous high of 19%. This is much closer to the historical averages that they had. As the gestation period for their new outlet passes, I predict that operating margins will improve. However, I do think that the margins will fall over time. This is probably because the cost to service and acquire customers will probably rise due to the healthcare market becoming more competitive. This is much closer to the operating margins of the industry average.This is probably a more conservative estimate, as it runs against the trend of growing profitability of the firm, as well as the economies of scales that the firm enjoys as it grows. As the firm grows and matures in the steady-state period, I lower margins rather than increase them. I am also reluctant to increase margins above the high of 19%, as that is significantly higher than the industry average. Given that Sales/Capital has reduced over time, I do believe that reinvestment rates will probably rise. This projection that I'm making is borne from my assumption that it would take more investments to service patients in the future. Cost Of Capital I determine the risk-free rate by using the risk-free rate of the 10-year government bonds of the Malaysian government. I then minus a default spread from the risk-free rate as the Malaysian government bond is not risk-free. I obtain a beta for the firm by taking the average industry unlevered beta and then leveraging it. The risk premium that I use is the equity risk premium of the Singapore market. Due to the exposure to the Malayan market, I add a country-specific risk-premium as well. I didn't change the capital structure for the firm as it is already at the industry average. I'm also not quite too sure what form of capital structure would suit the firm best. As the firm grows and matures, the cost of capital would slowly reduce Equity Value After discounting the free cash flows, I end up with a target price of RM0.70. This is signiciantly lower than the current trading price for the firm. With the assumptions that I have made, the shares of the firm seem overvalued, as it is trading at RM1.74. Perpahsp I have been too conservative. However, even when I change the assumptions to account for a very optimistic scenario, the target price still never exceeds the current trading price. I would stay away from investing in shares here.0 comments1"
