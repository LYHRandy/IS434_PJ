ProdigyAnswered on 19 Sep 2018I think what matters more, is not how much you earn but how much spare cash you have... becoz one can start investing with as low as $100/month with the DCA plans with POSB / OCBC.​The basic fundamentals need to be in place, e.g. emergency fund & ins protection, before you start investing.​Usually it will take a few years to see the compounded earning for your investments. Always be reminded that investment bound to come with some risk, at times, you may need to hold on to the investment a bit longer than expected due to market condition. Therefore, the money used for investment should be spare cash that you do not forsee the need to use for the next 6 months or in fact, for the next few years.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Saving is the Mother of All Investment.Every Investment have a risk.​If the amount invested does not give Good Returns, is ok to just keep Saving first with High Yield Account if the amount is possible.​In my opinion, instead of focusing on Investment, you should focus on Savings that can cover your asset purchasing.​If the opportunity comes and you can delay the assest purchasing, the amount you save will become the ""Investment"" that gives you Good Returns.​Hope my reply helps.​If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.​https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xi​Thank you.​​0 comments0"

4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Do set aside emergency funds first before investing, ideally 3 months or more if possible. Other than this, it does not take a lot to start investing. Can set aside S$100 a month to buy into local stocks through Maybank Ke (widest range of stocks available for selection), or POSB's Invest-Saver programme. ​There's also the possiblility of investing via robo advisories like Stashaway (no minimum amount) or Smartly (S$50 minimum per month).​Hopet this helps and all the best in your investment journey.0 comments0"

7,"ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Honestly speaking there isn't a minimum sum which you need accumulated in your bank to start investing, but often you should have a couple of months of emergency savings to tide over any storms which might hit you before jumping into investments! Sometimes you just gotta take the first small step, open a CDP account and see where that takes you:)0 comments0"
