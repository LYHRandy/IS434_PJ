Grand MasterAnswered on 25 Sep 2019CPF Board has penalties for employers and companies for not paying on time.Salary delays are frowned upon by MOM (Ministry of Manpower) but MOM won't know unless the staff files a complaint to the MOM.Soooo salary delays are less likely to be known, and boss may prefer to delay salaries instead of CPF to reduce penalties(Besides, CPF payment is way lower than salary)If this is because the pay date is behind the CPF pay date (around 14th), maybe it's just a scheduling of the cash flow for the company, may not be a bad issue. maybe you can check with the boss.0 comments1"
