1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jan 2019We understand the need to have more cash to yourself. But scholarship and bursaries are already enough for the deserving. Taking more, as what Kah Hwee mentioned, is depriving those in need too.We hope you can pay it forward with the scholarship you received already. 0 comments1"
