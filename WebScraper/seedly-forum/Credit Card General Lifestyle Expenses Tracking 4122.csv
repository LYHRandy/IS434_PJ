2,"Question Poster09 Jun 2019I think it onli shows how much money was topped up. eg if ezreload is 30$ and this month i top up twice, then it will show 60$, and not how much i spend in that month"

It allows you to view and track your transaction records, up to the last 180 days! It shows the fare paid for every trip. Alternatively, you can also use the Seedly app, but you won't be able to keep track of every single trip. It shows as a lump sum, either every 5 days or when total fares exceed $15.0 comments2"

GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi!You can hop onto the Seedly app which helps you to track your expenses and set budgets.By syncing your Citi SMRT credit card onto the app, they have a dedicated category called 'Public Transport' to help you track your public transport expenses for the month! With your first sync, the app will have 2 months worth of transactions from your card so you immediately can start tracking your transport expenditure.I personally use the app and find it really helpful in tracking my spending. It is also fuss-free and user-friendly too. :)You can scroll down to the bottom of this page and click on the buttons to download from the App Store or Play Store.2 comments2"
5,"Question Poster03 Jun 2019Cool. im actually using the app but didnt sync any cards. 

So if i sync the cc, does the public transport amount display the exact amount of transport fees, or only whenever there like a top up from my cc to the ezlink portion (eg $30 for my case)Jonathan Ng04 Jun 2019It reflects the top-up amounts! You should sync your cards so you can start tracking your expenses haha"

7,"Benedict LimLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You can try the ezlink app. they have the breakdown of each trip you take but it can be confusing because they charge the full distance amount then refund the balance ""distance fare"" that you did not travel1 comment0"
8,"Question Poster01 Jun 2019Yeaa i tried that, and sum everything, but the history onli goes back to a certain number of transactions (due to high number of charges and refunds, it onli shows me till like past 2-3weeks and not the whole month)"
