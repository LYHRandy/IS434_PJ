question,Policies Lifestyle Education Loans CPF Family Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Oct 2018I'm currently paying back my parents $100 monthly for the CPF education loan I took up last time. Should I try to clear this debt faster by repaying a higher sum (eg $200) or continue at a min of $100?I'm not intending to ask my parent to waive away the repayment of loan for me hence I'm here to ask which is a better option. Thank you. Thank you guys in advance! Assuming that lump sum repayment is not an option sadly.9 answersAnswerBump0

3,"Lim Zhi CongLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Same boat here. Currently serving NS so won't need to repay. Initially wanted to one shot pay back to clear debt ASAP. But after some thought, I would choose to pay 100/200 per month, the rest will be used for investments. I'm confident of being able to get more than 2.5% returns in my I investments, hence I choose to repay slowly.
This only applies if you are confident that you can beat the interest rates for your loan, if not best is to repay ASAP so that the interest doesn't snowball.
There is no shoe that can fit everyone's feet. In the end the decision can only be made by you. 0 comments1"

5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Like what Gabriel mentioned, if your debt has interest tagged to it, then better to clear ASAP. If there is no interest, then you can either take your time to repay so you can invest your money first, or pay it off soon to return the money to your parents ASAP.0 comments0"

I don't see the big deal of being debt free. Having more cashflow and liquidity is more important to me.I can generate more than 2.5% returns, so I'll hold off paying the loan.Plus if I need money, I can sell my investments but I cannot withdraw what I already paid off to my loan.0 comments0"

8,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Definitely recommend to clear the debt as fast as possible to avoid interest. The longer it takes to clear the debt, the more interest you need to pay.In fact if you can do lump sum repayment, that will be even better!2 comments0"
