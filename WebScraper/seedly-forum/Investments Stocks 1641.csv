1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would hold off to see how well subscribed Disney+ becomes. Currently from their aggressive pricing strategy of 6.90, we can see they are pricing below NFLX (half of netflix's 13USD monthly) and going for a market penetration strategy, targeting higher user adoption rates and top-line revenue generating strategy rather than profit making.With a 12% increase in stock price since the announcement, I would say street sentiment has priced in optimism on the announcement as well as future NPV of 36billion in market capitalization currently. Not sure exactly how big of a growth projection and numbers they are expecting. I would potentially look at NFLX/ AMZN and Hulu when they started out- taking an average to see how they would fair by next quarter.Definitely DIS bulls will hope to see better than expected numbers coming in nxt earnings report possibly from the existing quality content Disney already has and does not need to re-establish themselves. Going forward however, Disney must be able to continue generating content to retain its acquired users against strong competition from NFLX's market dominance.1 comment1"
