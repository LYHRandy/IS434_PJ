1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 01 Nov 2018Personally, I would clear off the education loan first so as to reduce the amount of interest payable since all investments carry risks and the returns are not guaranteed. Clearing off the debt gives me a peace of mind too! But of course, some would recommend investing if you can achieve higher returns than your loan's interest rate. But then again, investments returns are not guaranteed.Rule of thumb is to invest only with money that you can afford to lose.0 comments2"

Your parent can actually waive the repayment if they are at least 55years old and had set aside the basic retirement sum. You can always give cash to your parents monthly or topup their special account (for their retirement). The monies in special account earns interest rate at 4% and your parent will receive tax relief for the amount that is topped up. Eg. If they are in the 7% tax bracket, u are effectively 'earning' 7% return on the amount that u topped up. 0 comments1"
