This is for those whose income is less than $30,000 (I think MAS set $30,000 as a minimum requirement for credit card).A fixed deposit Credit Card allows you to start credit card scoring, so it builds your record which can be useful for your future loans.Also, my friend has poor record due to business loan but he wanted to start somewhere to build back a proper CC record. (he's a millionaire, so a very weird combination)He did get an OCBC card with only $2000 credit limit. He spends and pays back monthly. (and if you are keen, yes his CBS record is going up slowly from FF to D) I am guessing UOB and DBS would also offer low credit limit credit card if you ask.0 comments2"
