1,"Colin LimLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 04 Oct 2018to me rent is better and you can spend more during your retirement years.
buying of propertires will incur downpayment and cost..so upfront a bulk of your money will go to property and u have less to spend
if u want to buy property, whether 30years old or 5years old property... u want leave for your NOK? and 30years old property is lower in price...means u can have more cash.. 5year old property cost more...
unless i know more about your exact situation, these are a few things for you to ponder on.
