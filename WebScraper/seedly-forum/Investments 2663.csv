1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Hello, I think Sandra has given a rather wonderful breakdown of the reason behind why we shouldn't jump the gun and join the 'hype' behind the IPO craze.It is true that IPOs generate alot of buzz and attention - after all usually companies  that go public are those which have done well for themselves and have great financial backing and support by large financial institutions such as investment banks and sovereign funds. However, with such intense buzz and attention comes problems - uninformed investors who have not done due diligence in ensuring that the company's cash flows and performance is able to support and justify the high initial stock price at IPO will join in the fray, potentially resulting in the overvaluation of the stock. Once the stocks go public and the companies performance do not match up to its price, this will lead to a selloff that will cause the price to drop down from its highs, as seen in example of Facebook.Another reason to explain this usual steep downturns after a few months is due to the lock-up period. Insider investors such as officials and employees are required to sign a  lock-up agreements which are legally binding contracts between the underwriters and insiders of the company.This prevents them from selling any shares of stock for a specified period of time ranging from 90 days to about 24 months. After this period expires, many investors who want to realize their profits may quickly initiate a sell off, which creates immense downward pressure on the stock price. Flipping  also occurs when investors jump into IPOs and trade them speculatively, instead of holding them for the long term, as they don't see the potential of the company, but more of the fact that the stock currently has alot of attention and momentum to drive stock prices up so they can make a quick buck and sell off to others. Hence, if you are unsure of the company you are investing in, I advice to seek more professional advice first before placing a substantial amount of money into investing in IPOs. more often than not, their prices are hugely inflated with overly optimistic growth projections. Only if approporiate evidence via fundamental analysis shows that it is a good buy, should it then be considered. Gut feeling is akin to gambling in investing.0 comments2"
2,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Hello! Based on historical data, it is better to invest in a stock weeks or months after the company's IPO. For instance, Facebook's IPO price was $38 but as soon as trading started, prices dropped and it took 15 months for the share price to recover back to its IPO price. When investing, you'll want to look for shares that are inexpensive (priced lower than book value), but before an IPO, firms will try to increase their IPO valuation, driving IPO prices higher than the economic value of the business. This explains why most IPOs trade positively only for the few days after the IPO before the prices start to fall drastically. I would advise not to invest in IPOs as they are simply too risky. 0 comments1"
3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Feb 2019Investing in IPO is considered a rather risky investment. This is because it is new to the market making it difficult to predict what will happen to a new IPO over the first few trading sessions. It is also likely that investing in IPOs would mean having to deal with volatile price fluctuations along the way. It is also likely that the IPOs are being sold at prices far higher than the economic value of underlying businesses. Investing in IPOs are very risky, but the rewards should you invest in the correct firm may also be very high. 0 comments1"
4,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 22 Feb 2019IPO strategy is different from normal investing. Mainly, you go punting when it comes to IPO, i.e. You ballot for the shares and inmediately sell it off for profit. There are, however, some shares where you would keep, e.g. The co is a reputable one, such as OCBC or Berkshire Hathaway. I wouldnâ€™t depend on IPOs to invest in the long term. This is because you require two things which are out of control, which is the allocation and opening share price.

5,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 24 Feb 2019The answers around here are pretty interesting. Was looking through Hai Di Lao's share prices since they IPO recently, and noticed that although the share prices dipped since they IPO, it is actually at a new high now. Their PE ratio was actually considered too high at 76 when they IPO, but now it is higher at 85. Thoughts?0 comments0"
