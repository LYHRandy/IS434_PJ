MasterAnswered on 30 Jan 2019I run my income floor portfolio with a list of reits on sgx, with dca done on a reit counter on a monthly basis. This allows me to get returns of about 5-6+% onwards on my holdings. I focus my income ceiling portfolio in the US market using options. This allows to achieve returns of 60% pa with managed risk.0 comments1"
