question,"Insurance Loans Family Asked by AnonymousAsked 4w agoAdvice needed on how we should settle an accumulated policy loan?Hi everyone. I recently found out that my dad took a 5k loan from his life insurance policy years ago and he did not repay it. It has accumulated to 17k now due to the interest rate. It is a Great Eastern whole life insurance with CRB, and according to the 2015 bonus statement, the policy has accumulated ard 50k in bonus and illustrated surrender value is ard 100k+. The premiums paid annually is ard 1k.My question is if we have no means to repay it, would it be okay to surrender the value now?3 answersAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoI think it is better to talk directly to GE agents or servicing line to get the direct bonus and surrender value.If not cash tight, maybe paying back the loan, and leaving the policy to accumulate faster is a good idea.This happened in one of my dad's policies many years ago too, we paid the policy loan as the returns from the policy is at the mature end and the policy is accumulating better returns for my dad.If cash tight, of course, surrender the policy is an option. You can also sell the policies to an old-policy dealer such as... I can't tag him here. Loh Tat Tian is one of the second-hand dealers I think.0 comments1"
2,"NNiaLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2w agoAn update:We will be going to the customer service counter tomorrow, but I have received a recent letter from them regarding the cash value of this policy.
It's wayyy under the illustrated value. The illustrated cash value at year 28 is ard $79k but the actual cash value now at year 30 is $50k. That's such a huge disparity? Is this normal? The old policy plan doesn't have columns for ""guaranteed"" and ""projected/illustrated"" but just ""Cash value"", ""Paid-up value"" and ""Projected Death Benefit"". I'm just assuming that its illustrated.Also, I'm wondering if it's possible to ""minus"" off this loan from the cash value. It's pretty unethical of them to let the loan accumulate all these years without checking on the client from 5k to 17k. Sure its legally not wrong, but I'm pretty taken aback at how uncaring insurance companies can be.Sorry for the rant. I will update again after going to the office tomorrow.2 comments0"
3,"Loh Tat Tian2w agoYou have to understand a few critierias and the assumptions built into the plan.

(1) When is the plan bought? If it is at year 28, likely the plan is at a higher return. Plans in those days show 8% returns. Hence likely a downward revision. But if you calculate the IRR, it should be at least 5% to 6%.Question Poster2w agoFinal update:
Okay i have went to their office and their plan has changed. So my only option is to repay the loan or to surrender the plan. The SV increases by $4k every year (guaranteed + non-guaranteed). So taking into account the interest ($1k increment every year) and annual premium ($1k+), we are profitting around 2k. 
So we have decided to surrender it in 2 years time.
TPD coverage ends at age 60 and now left death benefit only.

4,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered 4w agoThere are a few ways you can do it for the policy. The policy loan is currently at about 5.75% (for most insurers) if I am not wrong. The yearly returns should be around 6 or 7% depending.For such cases, it depends on whether you need the money urgently etc, or convert it to a paid-up one.I offer to buy over (even with loans) because it is interesting. If you wish, you can write to me at value.matrix@outlook.com or Facebook  https://www.facebook.com/tattian.loh
Do speak with an FA who could run you through the numbers.0 comments0"
