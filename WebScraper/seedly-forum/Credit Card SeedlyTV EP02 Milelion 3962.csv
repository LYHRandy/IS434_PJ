Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoIf you don't travel a lot or don't intend to travel a lot, you may be better off with CASHBACK credit cards.They offer you cashback directly, so you can use the cash for whatever you want.Some examples are Standard Chartered cashback, UOB One Card, OCBC 360 etc etcCashback cards are easier as you don't have to keep track of miles, and when to redeem them.Miles are more complicated than cashback becausemiles have expiry once transferred from CC to airlines, and also some CC have an expiry date for miles points, and miles for flight have different ""pricing"" at different seasons of the year)0 comments0"
