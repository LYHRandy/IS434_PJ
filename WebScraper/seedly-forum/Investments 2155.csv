1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My biggest mistake was trying to find the holy grail of investing.I lost more money taking courses than actually losing money in stocks. I did lose money early on in my investing years but I spent more on courses. Taking courses is good but don't be excessive. After a certain point, most courses start to sound the same and teach similar things. Every trainer will claim to have some special technique or method to give you magically good profits.1 comment2"

MasterAnswered on 16 Mar 2019It's a little funny but it was a side business of mine to resell phone covers that I got from a Taobao supplier on Carousell - I bought 100 units of it expecting people to have a good demand for it, turns out I found 3 similar people that were selling lower than my unit cost.Just goes to show that if you don't do research it'll come bite you in the ass. If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.0 comments1"
4,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Mar 2019I know I'm still quite young, but I realised I should have started earlier with investing. Not so much because I missed out on my returns, but because I did not study more about finance during my times in NS. I had quite a lot of time during and after NS before uni, and it was kind of a waste I didn't start then.0 comments0"
