question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Feb 2019My husband's company has dental and eye wear benefits of $700 per year. How can we maximise/take advantage of this?Both of us wore braces prior already, beside braces claims/buying an expensive pair of spectacles, how else can we maximise this benefit? Just to share, I usually spend $50x2 per year on dental cleaning services and buy contact lens/solution in JB as it is cheaper. Thank you all for your help!2 answersAnswerBump0"
