1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 27 Aug 2019To buy REITs or any other counter listed on SGX, you will need to go through a broker like DBS Vickers. The shares will be deposited in your CDP provided your account with the broker is a non-custodian one. 3 comments3"
2,"See all 3 comments Question Poster27 Aug 2019Other than REITs, if I want to buy other shares do I need to go through Vickers too or I can buy direct from SGX. If so, how do I do it?Jonathan Chia Guangrong27 Aug 2019Well, SGX is just an exchange where buyers and sellers meet. You will still need to place an order through Vickers to buy or sell shares."
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 22 Aug 2019As what Jonathan shared, you'll need to go through a broker to buy any stocks/REITs/bonds from the market.CDP is just a place for you to store your stocks/REITs/bonds under your name. DBS Vickers is the medium by which you buy/sell your investments.Long story short, use Vickers to buy REITs. The REITs will then be automatically transferred to your CDP to be stored under your name.1 comment1"
