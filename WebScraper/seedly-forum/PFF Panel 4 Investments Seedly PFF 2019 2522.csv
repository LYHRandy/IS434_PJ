And, have you heard some people say the reason why Warren Buffett is so successful is because he invests like a woman?We usually fear what we do not know. So build confidence by reading (lots of free books and resources online) and attending courses. Then you'll realise many of your fears towards investing are unwarranted, or, you'll find your way to manage these fears.0 comments0"
