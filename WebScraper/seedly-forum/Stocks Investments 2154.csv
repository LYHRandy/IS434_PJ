1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Mar 2019Although PDD's share price was sitting 60% above its IPO price, its recent drop by 17%, amounting to $358 million was due to heaving spending on advertising and the technology required to grow its e-commerce share. PDD's sales and marketing expenses are exceeding its sales twice in the past 3 quarters. In other words, its earnings are negative. That being said, PDD could be the next gem due to fact that the firm has a strong backer, strong cash assets on its balance sheet and an unique value proposition. This results in high barriers to entry for competitors. PDD is backed by WeChat operator Tencent Holdings Ltd, giving them more than $3 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet. PDD's unique value proposition hinders existing or new players from competing with them directly due to the high traffic of its mobile app.0 comments3"
