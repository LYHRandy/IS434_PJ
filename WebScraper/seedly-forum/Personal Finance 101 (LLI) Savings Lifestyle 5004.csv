$500 for tuition loan (8k balance) 
$400 for insurance
$400 for food
$150 for transport and HP
$250 RSP Total expenses is about $2,300/monthLeftover $700 *12 = $8,400.001) Can check what is the loan percentage?
2) why did you start on RSP
3) Emergency fund settled?
4) How much are you looking at to spend for wedding? 4 comments0"
2,"See all 4 comments Question Poster24 Dec 2018I agree that the tuition fee loan is my top priority right now and I'm working to get it down asap and I will to build my emergency funds asap. 

We shouldn't be taking loan for wedding because we've set money aside for it which we can tap into and it should be able to pay for the wedding as a whole, but just maybe reno loan and lowering the budget.

Thanks for the advice.Loh Tat Tian25 Dec 2018I hope my advice is helpful enough for you. 

Anyway, after all the heavy stuff, congrats on the wedding and renovation :D."
