Also, I only have very little capital on my bank account. How do I start?Im an NSF. I have a business idea that I strongly believe that it can work. I dream and constantly plan about it now in my free time. However, I am limited to my abilities, connection and capital. Also, my mind continually discourage me because I am neither experienced nor qualified yet. Still, I want to play aggressive in my young age and am ready to start. I dream to be the Steve Jobs of South East Asia. Please suggest a direction to be a young Entrepreneur. I am insanely optimistic!6 answersAnswerBump0"

6,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Look around for people with similar interests and share your idea with them if you are comfortable to do so. Capital shouldn't deter you from executing your idea as you can pitch your idea to potential investors or incubators and if they find it viable, I'm sure that they'll back you up by investing in your idea/providing with capital to execute your idea. First and foremost, it'll be good if you can get a good team and partner(s) as it'll be much easier to develop your idea from there!0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018erm....why not  对症下药 ?Idea is worth nothing if you cant support it urself or u risk the idea being stolen.You need a team if you manage urself and to have a team, you must have what it takes for them to join u.​Being Aggressive with susbtance is the BEST but to do it without will only result in regret and opportunities lost.​Get the experience you needed for ur idea and see whether it really works for u.​If u are really good in the idea you had, u might even be offer a place as a partner when you prove ur worth.​Using other people money to make your own money when you have the skills and passion.​Using ur own money and pay a lesson when you have no skill and just passion.​Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.​​​0 comments0"
