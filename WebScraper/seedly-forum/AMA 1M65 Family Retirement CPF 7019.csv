God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Nov 2018When she turns 55, her SA and OA will be set aside to meet the Full Retirement Sum in her newly opened RA Account. SA will be withdrawn from first before OA.This forms her CPF Life from 65 for life.Now if she has any balance above the FRS, she can withdraw this at anytime. It's almost like an ATM and you can do so via PayNow.0 comments2"
