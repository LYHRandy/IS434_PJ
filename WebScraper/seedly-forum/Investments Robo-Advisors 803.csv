1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 19 Jul 2019Biggest issue I have is that while ETFs are passive tools, Robos may take a too active approach with trading these ETFs like how fund managers trade individual underlying securities, thus making the strategy not as passive as it should be.And also, I'm still a big believer in Alpha and reducing risk with active management. As a financial advisor, it's my job to find funds that actively beat their benchmarks and allow clients to achieve their financial goals with the least risk taken as possible. Active management still has a big role to play in achieving that. And I'd rather trust fund managers to provide that instead of untested AI algorithms.1 comment4"

3,"Thaddeus Tan, Community Lead at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 22 Jul 2019Robo-advisors are digital platforms created by humans which provide investment services with little to no human supervision as they are algorithm-driven. A typical robo-advisor collects information from clients about their financial situation and future goals through an online survey and then uses the data to automatically invest client assets. In Singapore, there are 5 robo-advisors you can choose to invest with. They are Smartly, Autowealth, Stashaway, MoneyOwl and Endowus. Although they might seem like they were started for the same purpose, there are differences which sets them apart from one another. We will examine them later on.I think that it is important to note that Robo-advisors is not really an asset class contrary to popular belief. Asset classes include stocks, bonds, ETFs, Unit Trusts, REITs and property. By using Robos to invest, you are effectively tapping on a platform so that you can invest in certain asset classes as compared to if you were to hire a financial advisor to do it for you or even DIY. Using robos enables you to adopt a low cost, diversified, passive approach especially since you are letting the algorithm invest for you. Instead, Robos act as platform so that you can invest in certain asset classes as compared to if you were to hire a financial advisor to do it for you.Now to address your question, whether robo-advisors are something that should be considered now, it ultimately voices down to what type of person you are. If you feel that you are somebody who is relatively new to investing, investing for the long term and lastly don’t have alot of time to choose and pick your stocks individually (more passive way of investing), then I feel that you CAN consider Robo-advisors. However, please still do your own due diligence.Let’s compare between robo-advisors and human advisors before diving into the pros and cons.Low cost :The main advantage of robo-advisors is that they are low-cost alternatives to traditional advisors. By eliminating human labor, online platforms can offer the same services at a fraction of the cost. Robo-advisors thus charge a lower fee than a human advisor.Services: The services offered by a robo-advisor is usually only investments. However for human advisors, they usually provide a wider range of services like financial planning etc.What type of people they are for:Here are some of the pros and cons of associated with using robo-advisors to invest.So now that you know more about robo-advisors, let’s look at what robo-advisors are there that are available for you to invest with. In Singapore, there are 5 robo advisors.

Different robos have different investment methodologies as seen above.

As always, the information as seen above is there to give you some background on the different robos in Singapore.

WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jul 2019Robo advisors quite simple and easy to understand. they are generally cheaper than many ""expert human advisors"" out there.their allocation can generally be found too. if you are comfortable with it, go for it. if not, then stay out.human advisors may tell you to stay out of robo advisor investing. but robo advisors wont try to talk you out of engaging human advisors.whats the logic behind this? its up to individual to evaluate this.personally, i put small tiny amount every month to try robo investing out. no harm trying.0 comments1"
