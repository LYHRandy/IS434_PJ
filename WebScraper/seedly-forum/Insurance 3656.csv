God of WisdomAnswered on 18 Sep 2019Other than Hospitalization and a Personal Accident plan for a child, an Early Critical Illness policy would be advisable.The idea here is that there would be a loss of income for the household should the child fall ill, as parents may need to quit their job to take care of the child or hire additional help to help take care of the child.The rule of thumb on how much coverage would be 1-2 years of household income.Additionally, you may want to start saving for your child's education need. Set aside 5% of the household income every year. Your choice of what to save or invest this in is up to you. A simple way to guarantee the funds would be there no matter what would be to use an endowment policy with payor benefit waivers should anything happen to you or your spouse. The premiums of the policy will be waived.0 comments3"

Grand MasterUpdated on 19 Sep 2019Term policies (for medical, premature death, critical illness) for mother and father is the basic fundamental policies. For me, I didn't get anything else beside terms for mother and father.The kid has no income and does not need term insurance for premature death. I don't understand why so many agents like to sell whole life or policies for kids that have no income to replace if a bad situation occurs. Do get basic medical insurance (hospitalisation and surgery) for the kid though. For savings, I buy stocks to hold for my son (in the long run)Inspired by a lady who received DIS stocks that were bought at $20 by her father. (DIS is now $137 USD)5 comments1"

A WL with CI covering 200K costs just $2K/yr for 10 years premium term, and the child gets lifetime coverage. At 25 years old, the same coverage of 200K will still cost $2K/yr, but for 20 or 25 years. So it's really a gift for the child, but I would not put it as the utmost priority."
