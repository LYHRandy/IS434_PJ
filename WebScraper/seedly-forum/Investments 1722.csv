WizardAnswered on 27 Apr 2019Apart from books, I like to read Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports over the years to understand how they look at being successful in portfolio performance. That said, it's possible to keep reading (and reading) and not action on anything.Which brings me to my second point.Form a conviction in a stock, and make a small position in it.It will:Accelerate your learning curve - because you are putting skin in the game, you are likely to learn all you can about the stock, even though it's your first timeBecause now you have dipped your toes in, the material you read (be it books/annual reports/analyst reports) will be more relevant. You will look for certain data points.You will also learn the emotional aspect of investing. Monitor how you reach when the stock dips/rises. How often do you check on the price? What is your own investment timeline? All these observations about yourself will help you learn.Hope this helps, and hope you get started on your investing journey!0 comments2"

1) invest in something that you donâ€™t understand 
2) invest because you are pressured to do it 
3) invest because someone said so Good luck0 comments0"
