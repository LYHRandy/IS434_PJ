1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Based on their website, it should be after you open your multiplier account. You should use the SSB ladder method instead as the RSP method only last for 12 months. But it will take 6 months and minimum $3,012 for the method to start working.0 comments0"
