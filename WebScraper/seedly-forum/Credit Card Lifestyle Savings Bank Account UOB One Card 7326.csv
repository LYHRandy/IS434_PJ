1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 23 Aug 2019The one who told you the supp card cannot hit the tier is wrong.According to UOB One Card T&C, here are key points:1) “Card Transactions” means the transactions successfully charged to the Card Account by the Principal Cardmember and the Supplementary Cardmember, AND posted on the Bank’s systems, but excludes the Exclusions.2) Tier 1 Minimum Spend means: (i) The Card Transaction amount in each Statement for the Quarter is at least S$500 but less than S$1,000; AND (ii) Charged at least 5 Card Transactions in each Statement Month within the Quarter.3) Tier 2 Minimum Spend means: (i) The Card Transaction amount in each Statement for the Quarter is at least S$1,000 but less than S$2,000; AND (ii) Charged at least 5 Card Transactions in each Statement Month within the Quarter.4) Tier 3 Minimum Spend means: (i) The Card Transaction amount in each Statement for the Quarter (ii) is at least S$2,000; AND (iii) Charged at least 5 Card Transactions in each Statement Month within the Quarter.In short, as long as you, the main cardholder, have 5 transactions per month, and your total spend across your card (main card) and your SO's card (supp card) hit at least $500, you are eligible for cash rebate.Link to T&C: https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdfHope this helps!0 comments2"
2,"LLolaLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 23 Aug 2019I too have a joint one account with my partner. Based on experience, the supplementary card does not count towards the $500 min spend as I found out during the first few months using it. What we did was to request another card for the “main person”. So now we have 2 debit cards under the main person name, but one is MasterCard and one is Visa. So far both spending counts to hit the tier, you just sometimes get weird looks when you pay with a card that’s not under your name.1 comment0"
