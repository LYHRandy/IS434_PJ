You can get a projected 9000 per year from this 150k sum for life without a reduction in capital or exposure to the stock market. :)2 comments3"
2,Gabriel Tham01 Apr 2019This definitely beats SSB!Hariz Arthur Maloy01 Apr 2019SSB gives a higher guaranteed % for sure. But also only lasts for 10 years. After 10 years you open yourself to reinvestment risk as well. Different product for different needs. :)

WizardAnswered on 01 Apr 2019If you are able to open a CDP account in SG as well as have a SG bank account, then you can put the 150k into Singapore savings bond.They are super low risk and is issued by the singapore government. For periodic stream of income, you can split the 150k into 6 batches and apply for 6 consecutive months of SSB. They payout twice a year so you would get income every month.0 comments0"
