WizardAnswered on 08 Nov 2018Gonna quote Investopedia here on this.What is 'Return on Investment (ROI)'Return on Investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. ROI tries to directly measure the amount of return on an particular investment, relative to the investment’s cost. To calculate ROI, the benefit (or return) of an investment is divided by the cost of the investment. The result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.The return on investment formula:ROI = (Gain from Investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of InvestmentIn the above formula, ""Gain from Investment” refers to the proceeds obtained from the sale of the investment of interest.
