1,"Marcus TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Dec 2018I think it ultimately depends on your risk appetite. Put yourself into an arbitrary situation in which market crashes today, and 30% of your savings will be wiped out. Translate that to absolute terms. Are you able to stomach the loss? If yes, hold. If not, cash out now (or soon).There are so many analysts gazing into the crystal ball, predicting the next recession. But so long you steer clear of market noises, have absolute confidence in what you invest in, you will do fine in a bear market.0 comments0"

MasterUpdated on 20 Dec 2018If you already invested, i would say just hold it since you do not really know a recession is really coming. Maybe you can stop investing more and start accumulating extra savings for warchest where you can invest more when a recession actually happen.0 comments0"
3,Jun Hao TayLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 20 Dec 2018The question is whether market timing is a good strategy to making money. Most people do not have much success trying to time the market by jumping in and out (remember you incur brokerage costs each time you go in and out).I recommend reading more about dollar cost averaging into index funds as a more sustainable strategy going forward if you are not an active investor.0 comments0
