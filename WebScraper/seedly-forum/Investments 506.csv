1,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 18 Sep 2019A professional trader on forex earns about 10 - 15% on average monthly.Sounds good? It's true... but you are not hearing the whole thing.It's a job, it's a full-time job, and they need to grind and focus on it. I know of guys who can do other jobs and probably earn more salary per month. Forex traders earn that because they spend hours and hours working for it, and waiting and checking for that one or two trade per day (probably spend 2-3 hours checking just to find a single trade)Novice or even mid-term traders? Statistically, 95% lose money.0 comments1"
