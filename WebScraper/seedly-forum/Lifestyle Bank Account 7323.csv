question,Lifestyle Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Aug 2019Should I change my USD dollars back to SGD or use it to change to other foreign currency in the future?I have around 770 USD cash right now due to my business trip. I converted 1k SGD at that time but didn't manage to spend much. Should I convert back to SGD and buy SSB etc or should I keep it and use the USD at some countries that accept them if I supposedly go on a trip (like Vietnam) Any ideas?1 answerAnswerBump0
