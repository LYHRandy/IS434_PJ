1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Jun 2019No - that would somewhat be like borrowing money and take it to casino to gamble. There is always a possibility that you buy the reit at high price, only to see an unrealised loss later. The leverage amplifies the loss, and it could lead to the debt snowballing.Its a rather high risk move that's probably not worth the risk. If you can't afford purchase without leverage, consider regular monthly investments using the plans available under ocbc bcip, or some other rsp instead. The fees are low, and usually you can make contributions as low as 100 (its just not efficient considering fees / contribution would be 5% or higher).0 comments0"
