MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018While I do not understand the full details of your personal, health, financial and family situation, I would advise you to get a job as people live until a ripe old age of 80+ years old and I would encourage you to continue working so that you can contribute more money to your CPF and also transfer funds from your OA and SA. If Donald Trump can work until 70+ years old and Mahathir can work until 90+ years old, I think we can all work until a very old age if our health permits. 0 comments0"
