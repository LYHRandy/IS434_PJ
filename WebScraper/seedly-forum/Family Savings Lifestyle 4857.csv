1,TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 28 Apr 2019This is hard to predict. The 'islandwide GPS ERP system' (by mileage) is coming soon and so far we are still unsure of the cost structure. If the cost for the new ERP system is high then definitely the COE will go down to compensate for the difference. (Also because there will be less demands because of the additional cost of driving)0 comments0
