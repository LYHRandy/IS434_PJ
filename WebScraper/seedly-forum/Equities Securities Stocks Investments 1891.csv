2,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Apr 2019For life, has to be:1) One that you know (So we know what we're doing in order to make $, if it doesn't make $, why do we invest ? ) 2) One that make $ (If it doesn't make $, why invest ? ) if is;SG - (1) = yes. (2) = ? (STI is know to be stale for long. Since we invest to make $, why choose a stale market? and not make enough$ ? ) USA - (1) = No. (2) = Yes as it's proven.  (1) can be overcome by learning, if we want to invest in one marketing for life, just like marry someone you know for life, we got to learn everything about him / her, in this case , USA S&P500.There's Still HK hangseng and China (high potential with it's AI and tech looking to surpass USA). Also remember to diversify to manage risk. Thus if is for me, I'll choose according to age and risk profile. USA and China for 60%, HK / SG  40%. If die die has to be 1 market, then pick USA because of it's relative growth over the last 100 years on S&P500. Cheers.0 comments1"

Also, i feel that US would be able to give a large diversification in terms of the stocks available to invest in, enabling you to be able to diversify your portfolio.0 comments0"

5,"Guo Hao Teo, Self-Taught Enthusiast at Personal FinanceLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 01 Apr 2019I would say invest in a country that you plan to ultimately retire in. But that’s my own thoughts!US would be the obvious choice as th S&P has shown to have grown over the years. But that may not be a good indicator for future as the world is changing as we speak.0 comments0"
6,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Apr 2019US.Most of the most innovative tech and products are born out of the US market. Google, Apple, Tesla, Starbucks etcWill China be able to replicate the same level of innovation? I think it will take a very long time to cultivate the innovation mindset of the mainland Chinese.0 comments0"
