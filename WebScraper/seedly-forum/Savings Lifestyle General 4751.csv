1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 03 Jul 2019If you want to supercharge your savings, perhaps your food and entertainment can cut down. Simple example calculation here: Lunch $5 + Dinner $5 =$10 a day. 30 Days, $300.Why didn't count breakfast? Buy a loaf of bread + butter or peanut butter, even nutella also can. 1 Week 1 loaf of bread = about $2 a week.You need some entertainment, maybe a movie a week $10. Restaurant don't eat so expensive, can go those $20-30 range.
I think you can cut down your $800 food/entertainment as a single. No starbucks, no bubble teas :)3 comments5"
2,See all 3 comments Gabriel Tham01 Jul 2019You can do it!Rx03 Jul 2019I’m doing that too! And it works pretty well. Best is to track ur expenses so you can cut down on unnecessary expenses!

4,Question Poster01 Jul 2019Thank you for the link. I’ll read up and come up with a plan. I’ve been a YNAB app user since first launch and I’m considering to use it again.
5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 01 Jul 2019The very first thing you should do is to track your expenses, then find out where you can cut. To be honest, $800 per month for someone single and with no commitment is really high! For myself, I allocate about $350 for food and entertainment per month.Start investing. Read up. Seedly has many good resources. There are also many financial bloggers available online; all you have to do is to Google them.Cut down on subscriptions, if you can. Do you really need them? You can also choose to share subscriptions with people (for example, Spotify's family plan, which is only $2.50/month)Set up a high interest savings account. Trust me, you'll feel good when you see the interest you are getting increasing month after month.1 comment2"
6,Question Poster01 Jul 2019Will probably save up to a healthy sum in savings before considering investments. Will relook my subscriptions again.
7,"MujimoroLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 01 Jul 2019Short term:
CUT big impulse purchases immediately. And are there any other ways to cut expenditure, for e.g. on food? There are plenty of low cost options out there.. what about rental?Mid term:
You need to save up enough for emergency funds before thinking about investing. What will happen if — touch wood — you’re faced with retrenchment or medical emergency? You should save up enough to cover around 6 months of salary as “emergency funds”. You might want to open a savings account with moderate interest rate as you grow this fund, for e.g. DBS multiplier (requires salary credit, CC spend, and other conditions) or CIMB FastSaver (lower interest rate but no conditions). There are lots of options out there, so do your research. Long term:
Once you establish your emergency funds, start looking at investing your savings into say RSP for STI ETF (around 2-3% return) or SSB or Robo-Advisor or similar. Remember, anything you save can be invested for the future; but remember to spend a little occasionally too as a treat :)1 comment2"

WonderkidUpdated on 01 Jul 2019Start by paying 50% income (nett income after CPF deduction) to yourself in a good savings account, before settling monthly expenses.Food and entertainment wise can drop by $100 to see if you are comfortable with the new Budget.If you have marketable skills can do some side jobs to supplement your main income, and make this extra income pay for your monthly food and entertainment expenses of $800 (estimated).Hope this helps !1 comment1"
10,"Question Poster01 Jul 2019I am saving 40% at least to savings. But my impulse purchases are usually even bigger sum. I guess I have to curb the impulse big purchases first. I can’t side income much as my job is taking up most of my time, and I’ll end up “rewarding” myself by buying something too expensive. Thank you for the tips."
11,"Daniel LeeLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Apart from what they have shared, I think it may be worth looking at your insurance portfolio and compare it with the similar products available in the marketThe reason is because, many of times we feel that we should cut down on our day-to-day expense but in reality we forgot that there may be cost saving opportunities in the bigger ticket items such as insurances.Do check out your insurnace portfolio, especially when we're still young, the mistakes are easily reversible as compared to 10-20 years down the road.In terms of investing, I do not recommend that you immediately pour your savings into investment without first understanding:what is your purpose of investing in the markets?what strategy would be suitable to achieve the returns needed to fulfill your purpose in (1)It will be good if you can speak to an investment specialist, or if you wish to D.I.Y. here are some books i would recommend you to read:1) The intelligent investor - Benjamin Graham2) Security Analysis - Benjamin Graham3) common sense on mutual funds - John C bogle.An an independent retirement planner, I have seen countless cases where people invest blindly only to literally be met with tramendous losses at the end of the day due to poor strategy and lack of proper management.Looking at their journey, i rather you save your money in the bank or spend your money on something that you would enjoy as opposed to investing blindly in hopes to grow your money.I wish you all the best on your journey and should you need any help or book recommendations you can hit me up here0 comments2"
12,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 04 Jul 2019One way that I use to build up my savings is the concept of ""paying myself first.""
I started saving 10% of my income before CPF contribution when I first started working. I transferred those funds into a savings account which I have no access to. No ATM card.
When I see the savings account grow, I started to save more and more aggressively till 30% of my income. This strategy works well for me and I manage to save and work within my budget.
Budgeting is tiring. But when you pay yourself first and budget with the rest of the funds, you will be able to find more joy seeing your account grow. This will motivate you to save more.0 comments0"
13,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 01 Jul 2019I read to the answers of the others before replying. Most of what they say is right. One way to cut a large cut out of your expense is to move to a place with lesser rent. Think a room rent in HDB flat, in say Yishun or Sengkang is about $400-500. But this is subject to your current contract. I’m assuming your Budget above is not what you’ve been spending but what you are proposing cause if you have followed it you would have saved more than $20k already. Looks good for a starter. If you keep to it. But follow the advise of others if you want to save more3 comments0"
14,"See all 3 comments Serene Toh01 Jul 2019Totally know what you mean. My first year of work as an intern (earning only $1000) is spent everything I earn on an overseas trip.

At least you woke up early. If spending is an issue it may be better for you to have another account you allocate just for spending. And only use portion of year end bonus for big ticket items.

... (more)Serene Toh01 Jul 2019One alternative way is to set up saving goals instead. Ie you target to save $XX amount by XX day. Then you’ll start to panic when you realise not reaching your goal and hence help to curb your impulse. 

Cause you’ll see the negative, “I’m still short by how much to my goal, so can’t spent too much” instead of the positive “I’ve done so well by saving so much, let’s reward myself”
