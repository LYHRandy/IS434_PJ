question,"General Bank Account Retirement Asked by Loh Tat TianAsked on 26 Sep 2018How do I help my mum to earn higher interest in CPF SA, while she's having less than $20,000 in her RA/Medisave combined in CPF?I am trying to help my mum have more liquid money while earning higher interest. And since Paynow can be used, I figure it can be a bank account for my mum. But I am worried that CPF will transfer available funds to make up her BRS instead. She wants the liquidity.1 answerAnswerBump1"
