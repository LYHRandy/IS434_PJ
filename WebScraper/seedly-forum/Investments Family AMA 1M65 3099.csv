1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I really depends on what are your financial goals and risk appetite. The CPF SA is actually what i advocate, but you do not need to pour all your funds into it at once.
For the first $60k in your CPF combined balance (with only up to $20k max from OA), the monies will earn an extra 1%. Since you are still young, u will not be near the limit yet. Thus it is worthwhile to topup to earn effective 5% return. Risk-free, regardless of market conditions. In additional u will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-5% interest yearly guaranteed. If you earn more than $80k, u will be in the 11.5% tax bracket, thus saving more. Topup $7k into your special account every year, to enjoy the maximum $7k tax relief per tax year. You can also decide to topup CPF of your mother, to earn another $7k tax relief. This will be very beneficial if your mum's CPF had no money, as the first $30k earns 6% interest (assuming she is 55yo above). But doing this way you might also want to consider the legacy issue of your mum (are u the only child?). Therefore, a year you can topup $14k, resulting in savings of almost $1k or more tax money a year. At the same time, you can have a smaller stock portfolio, that u can take on a higher risk level to attempt to achieve a much higher returns. The CPF will act as a strong base (riskfree), while your stocks will add the icing if it does well. Bear in mind CPF is consistent, while the stock market might give a higher return over the long term. The timing of your retirement might not coincide with the right market timing. Eg. If the market goes into a multi year bear market when u retire. Do chat me up on my fb if you want to discuss further or planning. 2 comments1"

""Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-5% interest yearly guaranteed.""  This is a very interesting way to frame it!Yixiong Chang07 Nov 2018If you take the topup special account route, it is only $7k a year (max tax relief granted). You do not need to covert your whole portfolio into SA, even if u do, to maximize tax benefit, it will take over 10years. Therefore u do not need to worry about liquidity. In fact, the other way to view it is that your CPF is like a bond portfolio (risk free treasuries), you would have already 'diversified' your portfolio this way. You can then focus your cash in pure equities of higher risk for higher potential return. "
3,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Does the 100k stock and bond portfolio form a large part of your assets? What is the percentage you currently have in terms of your net worth being parked aside in the stock and bond portfolio?It is difficult to advise without more information.A pure SA CPF account portfolio is attractive, but it provides a lack of liquidity and dividends until the age of 55. If you're risk averse, then it's definitely suitable for you. Furthermore, note that there is a maximum cap on how much CPF allows you to place inside your SA account through voluntary CPF contributions.However, if you're a moderate or aggressive investor, your stock and bond portfolio given the long investment time horizon could prove to be more effective in the long term.So ask yourself this, how much of a percentage does this stock and bond portfolio form as part of your net worth? Do you have any other emergency funds set aside outside of this stock and bond portfolio? Are you comfortable with zero liquidity all the way till 55 (assuming you hit the Basic Retirement Sum or Full Retirement Sum), or potentially 65 (Age to withdraw from CPF Life) once you've set aside this amount of money?Once you're able to figure those things out, you've gotten the answer to your question.1 comment1"

5,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019i have answered a similar question in this series of AMA, go check it out. Key is to note my sequence of portfolio investment. It is probably not well written by investment experts but I firmly believe that if you dont follow a right sequence of forming a financial safety net, you can’t invest well in risky investments. 1 comment0"
