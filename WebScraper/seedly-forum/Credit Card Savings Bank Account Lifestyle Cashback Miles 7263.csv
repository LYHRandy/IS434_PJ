question,"Credit Card Savings Bank Account Lifestyle Cashback Miles Asked by ZH AhHengAsked on 26 Aug 2019Hi there! I am new to the working force and I was wondering which DBS Cashback/Miles to get and to pair with DBS Multiplier?I have a take-home salary of 2k, DCA in a robot advisor at $200 monthly, paying bike petrol at ~$50 monthly. Pretty much sums up my monthly expenses. I give a portion back to parents but I do not handle paying utility bill using GIRO.I wish to travel at least once a year but I am not too sure if a miles card is worth it... Am in a dilemma ...2 answersAnswerBump2"

WizardAnswered on 26 Aug 2019Perhaps you can consider POSB Everyday card if you pump petrol at SPC?And multiplier doesn't have minimum spend required for the credit card. You can get POSB everyday card and just spend $1 a month on it.0 comments1"

When you share that you only travel once a year, it's actually not a bad thing haha.
The DBS Altitude card is a pretty good card to consider also if you want to get your first tickets for free.Because miles have either no expiry or maximum 3 years expiry, you can actually sign up and get the bonus miles and further than that, you can accumulate till your yearly trips.Essentially getting free trips every year. Something to consider about!0 comments0"
