question,"Investments Asked by Serene TohAsked on 14 Nov 2018What is the min amount of shares (in terms of cost) that you would buy if you are a 2 year beginner investor?I was really conservative for 2 years while learning how to invest. I tried to diversify my portfolio too quickly. I set aside $1K monthly to invest, & purchased shares whenever I get $2k-$3k. (Not cost effective, but this was the amount I was comfortable to lose)So now have about 20 shares @ $2k-5k each. Will reorganise these later. Need some advise fir future investments now Iâ€™m ready to up my game. What is the min to spend? Is it worth buying 1 share of stocks worth 1k USD each?1 answerAnswerBump1"
