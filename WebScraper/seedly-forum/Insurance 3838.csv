question,"Insurance Asked by Teng Kian EnAsked on 28 Apr 2019Any recommendation on basic health and life insurance for a young adult?Turning 21 this year, entering university, and have no health or life insurance currently.  I would like to hear some recommendations on some insurance plans (as there are way too many companies offering, making it difficult to compare objectively) and some key points to take note of when picking a plan for a young adult like me. ps. Life insurance is important to me as I'm the only child in the family. Am looking more for term insurance btw.Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 28 Apr 2019An integrated shield plan with a coinsurance and deductible rider from one of the 7 providers would cover for your health insurance needs. I'd look at AIA's, AXA's, and Raffles Health. For term life policies, the cheapest in the market would be Singlife, Aviva, and Manulife. Your focus now should be more Critical Illness Protection.
