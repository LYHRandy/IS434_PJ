1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019Hi there!I've personally faced this issue as well when I first started investing. I guess the reason why people have that notion of how you are getting more ""money-minded"" and start to ignore you is mainly because they don't understand the value of money! (And by investing I'm sure you are someone who appreciates and understand the importance of it).Perhaps how you can avoid this/not lose your friends is to educate them about the importance of wealth accumulation and learning more about the global economy and financial markets! That way, they will begin to understand why you do what you do and wouldn't deem you as being too ""money-minded"".0 comments2"
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019I talked alot about personal finance to my friends as well. They dont really ignore me but some looks not interested so i just stop talking about it to them. Those that are interested i talk more. There are people who say im more money minded and say i miser for not spending more. Its their loss if they dont listen after all. If they ignore you because of a simple topic provided that you are not selling them anything haha, they are not true friends and they are not ready to learn about money. People who are not ready to learn about money and dont treat it seriously, theres nothing much you can do. Talking about money last time is like a taboo topic, its getting better but still take some time for people to get used to it.Theres no need to avoid anything. You can start with more relax topic like savings first. If they look alright with the topic, then you go next level.0 comments1"
