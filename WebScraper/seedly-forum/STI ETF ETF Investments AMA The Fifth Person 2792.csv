1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Feb 2019Hi, I invest in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong , Thailand, Indonesia and United States Market. I generally go to different market when the opportunity arises. Personally, I am more skew toward investing in overseas market because of the growth and scale they have. If you are investing for income then Singapore market is good enough but if you are looking for growth, outside of Singapore will be better0 comments0"
