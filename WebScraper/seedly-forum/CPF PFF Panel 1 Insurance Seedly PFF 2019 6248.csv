MasterUpdated on 02 Mar 2019You need insurances such as hospitalization, critical illness, early critical illness and disability income so that you have money when something happen to you and you are unable to work. Life insurance is less important since u no dependants. CPF will give u monthly payout for your retirement. Topping up will compound your cpf and it is safer compared to other investments. You also get tax relief.0 comments0"
