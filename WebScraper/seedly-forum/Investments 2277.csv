1,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hello! Yes there is a difference between equity and shareholder's equity. A company's equity usually refers to the ownership of a public company. The level of ownership of an asset also refers to equity. While shareholder's equity is the net amount of a company's total assets and liabilities which are found on the balance sheet. It usually shows how much a company's operations is financed by equity. it can be considered as a measure of the company's net worth. hope this helps!0 comments0
