1,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi, I have similar experience but not exactly same issue as you. I loan my friend's bro money as start up capital and all in all, was cheated $30K. To make it worse, years later, I came to realise that my friend may have a part to play in the whole scam but there is no clear evidence. Felt stupid enough to place so much trust in her and almost all my hard earned money gone. I feel your heartache however, since legal means also can't help, the best way is to start afresh... Dwelling in it only cause yourself countless sleepless nights, which goes on for 2 yrs+ for me. I have since then moved on and treat it as a SUPER EXPENSIVE lesson! Instead of dwelling on what is lost, think of how you can grow your fund with your existing savings. All the best to you and may 2019 be a better year for you.Also, stop buying whatever branded goods from her that she cannot come up with receipt if you cannot even distinguish if those are genuine stuff.2 comments0"

News of scams remind me of this cheater bitch too...poor me!Ck Chai30 Dec 2018It took me few years to get over it... I was trying to live in denial and felt heart pain about the money that is gone... It isnâ€™t easy, still bear some hate towards the friend whenever I thought of the incident. But dwelling on it has not help me in any way, it only affected my quality of life with the dampen spirits... this goes on for 2 yrs+ I decided to bite the bullet & work hard, save hard, and bring myself back to where I was... took me years to save... now trying to learn about more investment & CPF planning, hoping to catch up and improve my financial standing .

There's little you can do to get back your money without ruining the existing relationship. Lending them gives them a short breather to continue the habit later on; lending them is not helping anyone at all. In the future, you should be prudent in lending (small sums) and refer them to NGOs/counsellors to seek help.2 comments0"
4,"Bear Cranky25 Dec 2018It ain't small sums! My FD $20K + 30yrs Interest from 1992 till nw, my gold, the many sums of hundreds & thousands loan her to settle her bills, add up to maybe $30k! Back then she cried so sadly & said Im d only kind soul to lend her so much! STUPID ME! Say will repay $300/mth bt very fast become $100/mth only. Nw stop repaying!Lok Yang Teng25 Dec 2018I hear you. When you decided to lend her the money, did you both sign an agreement or a document? If so you may decide on a legal course. Otherwise, it's really up to the person's conscience. Money that's gone can always be re-earned, but perhaps your conscience may not be clear if you had so decided to let her be back then. Treat is as a very expensive lesson that you sure wouldn't forget anytime soon."
5,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Just treat it as a super expensive lesson. There is nothing much you can do to get back your money unless she is willing to which i dont think she is. Only lend money that you can afford to lose so if they dont pay you treat it as a small lesson to yourself as this person is not worth your time anymore and staying longer with this person you might lose even more. If you keep thinking about this sum of money, you will get even more stress. If nothing can be done, just try not to stress too much about it alr. Too much stress will make you feel even worse and you might even fall sick and spend more money to get better which is not worth it.2 comments0"
6,"Question Poster25 Dec 2018Hi Nicholes, TY f ur advice. Really im so stressed brooding over tis $30k+ many sleepless nights, wake up cry angrily, police can't help as it's civil case. Lawyer can't help as it exceed 6yrs. Sometimes no motivation to work as I felt this $30k+ is many yrs of my hard-earned salary cheated! Past few times I met her, she was so well-dressed fr top to toe! No money to pay me! Liar! She told d Debt Collector she alr repaid in full! And say I gt mental problem! Ungrateful Bitch!Nicholes Wong26 Dec 2018There are a lot of people who are ungrateful, Facebook nowadays a lot of people also shared similar stuff like people who owe money dont pay and say until they did nothing wrong or used their partners money and then cheat on them. Just treat it as you dropped the money by accident. 30k is not a small sum of money but stressing yourself even more will cost even more and at the expense of your own health which is not worth it."
