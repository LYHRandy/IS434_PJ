question,Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Aug 2018Are there any downsides of getting different insurance from different insurers? E.g. getting term from insurer A then CI from insurer B instead of getting CI as an add on to my term policy?I feel that getting different insurance from different insurers will help to reduce the premiums significantly. Would like to know if there are any disadvantages of doing this though?4 answersAnswerBump0

1,Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Aug 2018It's usually more straight forward to buy all insurances from 1 company but I agree that you may be able to save costs by getting policies from different companies since not all policies are made equal (in terms of $ or coverages).​I personally am doing that and think there's no big disadvantage apart from the fact that you may have to familiarize yourself with how each companies do claiming in case your FA are not around when you need them most.0 comments0
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 25 Aug 2018On the contrary, it is more likely to cost more if u buy 2 same coverage-type from 2 insurer. There will typically be 'discount' for larger coverage purchase. Assuming you are buying your coverage at once. But if u are bought from insurer A, buying from insurer B is not much difference. There are circumstances/strategy that will require buying from different insurers. But normally, it is advisable to buy from same insurer. Easier for u to too. If u want to learn more do ping me. 0 comments0"
3,"Ng Lip Hong KyithLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 22 Aug 2018I think it should be ok. What you provided is that you get a different category of insurance from different insurer. Usually the trigger for each of these are different, so the administrative cost to handle them should be manageable. ​There are the odd cases where you will claim more than one category. In that case, you might need to do more legwork, if you do not have an advisor0 comments0"
4,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Aug 2018The upside as you have mentioned is perhaps cost savings.​However, I highly doubt that the cost savings would be significant since premiums are pretty competitive across various insurers. Would be good if you could take a look at the fine print, especially so if the cost savings are significant.​One downside is perhaps the ease of claims due to having multiple policies across various insurers. Hence, do spend some time with your advisor to come up with a summary of your policies so that it would be easy for yourself and your family members when something unfortunate happens.​Should you like a sample of an overview, do drop me an email at brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg0 comments0"
