1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019First and foremost, we need to compare it with cards from the same category which targets the same target audience. I don't think it's fair to compare it with other credit cards for working professionals who meet the minimum salary of 30k per annum for those cards with better cashback such as the Standard Chartered Unlimited or BOC Family card.  The CIMB AWSM credit card is targeted at students and NSFs. So given that it doesn't come with annual fees and yet still provides 1% unlimited cashback on dining and entertainment, online shopping and telco, I feel that this card is great since most of us NSFs/students often spend our money on these categories. Moreover, there is no minimum spending required as well. The competitor for this card is Maybank eVibes which offers 1% cashback for all categories but charges a fee of $5 quarterly if you do not charge to your card every 3 months. Whereas the CIMB AWSM is free for life, so you do not have to worry about anything at all except for paying your bills on time. Please refer to this article from Seedly which makes a comparison with the existing credit cards for students/NSFs - https://blog.seedly.sg/best-credit-cards-for-students/2 comments0"
2,Jay Liu19 Sep 2018Hey thanks for your answer. Actually I gathered information already! Just a note *Maybank Evibes* requires the NSF to be accepted into *approved* institutions upon ORD for card approval. Guess CIMB AWSM card is better. Gabriel Lee20 Sep 2018Yup that's right!

WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018benefits so so. ​Eg. 1% CB on dining, online, entertainment. => BOC Fam does better at 10% dining and online 5% but has cap on category and min spend $700.  Amex True cash back or SCB Unlimited is 1.5% no caps no min spend.​1% on telco. => BOC Fam is better at 5% but has cap on category and min spend of $700 ​Check out BOC fam T&C: http://pic.bankofchina.com/bocappd/singapore/201803/P020180327710875490784.pdf0 comments0"
