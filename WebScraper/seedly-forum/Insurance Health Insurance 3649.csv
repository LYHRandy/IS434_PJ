God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Sep 2019There are 7 insurers that provide the Integrated Shield Plan that you can use your Medisave to pay for.Of these, I can only distribute 5, and from the 5, usually, AXA shield is the one I recommend more often than the others.It is competitively priced with good miscellaneous benefits such as discounted GP and specialist visits, plus one of the highest Letter Of Guarantees provided upon hospitalization when you go through their panel of doctors.They have also been the quickest to respond and assist whenever I call through their claim hotline.2 comments2"
