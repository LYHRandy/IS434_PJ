Grand MasterAnswered on 10 Jun 2019I believe most credit card companies have wised up and no longer give credit card points for insurance premiums (not just life insurer, but general insurers too)I used to pay via Standard Chartered Bank's Manhanttan credit card to enjoy the cashback, and now, all the life insurance, car insurance etc no longer enjoys cashback.I believe its the same for all cashback cards, and probably most, if not all cards from Visa / Mastercard.I will be happy to know if there are still cards that give points for insurance premiums.0 comments3"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 12 Jun 2019I'd suggest using UOB credit cards if you have UOB One account. The premiums count towards the minimum spending needed for higher interest savings. This info is true as of writing. We don't know when banks change their policies!0 comments1"
3,"Cherie Julianne Tan, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Jun 2019When I was researching for which credit card to get, I saw this review of HSBC Advance Credit Card. But do note that he was sharing his experience as of June 2018, got to check with the bank if it is still valid. Although I just check the T&C's for this card, insurance premium is not under their exclusion. So you might have a chance at this.0 comments1"
