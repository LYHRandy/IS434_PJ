Then u can make a reasonable decision whether to stay, surrender or switch. No one will know what will be the future performance of the funds, u can only make a informed decision on risk/reward tradeoffs. 0 comments1"

I'm not going to pressure you or anything, just going to give you a specific analysis to what happened. The Golden Asia Growth Fund (which I'm quite intricately familiar with because it's ironically to you a historically high performingn fund) consists of quite a few Asian and Emerging Markets. While US markets suffered 50%+ losses, these markets had even larger losses. Of course, being a fund and not a index there was a lot of corrective action, but having bought at the highest point (which was 2007, when you purchased it), you started out by losing at least half your investment. It's really only been climbing back up over the last 8+ years or so. If you had looked at your policy LAST year instead of this year, you might have seen your money almost reach 10k. It's unfortunate, but 2007 was the highest point its ever been. I've left an illustration down there for you. Here's a couple of things to consider now:1) Do you need the money urgently, or not?2) What will you switch to, if you want to? Are there better funds? (there are)3) What does your time horizon look like? It's been 10 years+ since you started investing. Ignore Alan, he doesn't know this particular plan at all. There's no subsequent charges at all on your plan aside from the already-included fund management fee, and haven't been for the last 11 years. It's cheap, but you do have a decision to make. I'd like to help you, if you want it. You can always drop me a message if you'd like. No pressure. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments2"

I believe it was not doing well at all because there was no one who handled the investment for you. Currently the fund is about 5 years old only. (edit: the fund is from Feb 1997 after fact checking). The Factsheet is here. You may want to see if you are comfortable with the fund itself. https://www.trustnetoffshore.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=E2FM8&univ=DDFor the manu-link investment, it is a single premium investment. I believe the old fund could have caused the lost (not sure what you invested).For fund switch, I am unable to help. Hence, do find someone who have done fund research.Edit: Luke Ho is right. The fund started in 1997.0 comments0"
