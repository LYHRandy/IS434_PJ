1,"Yu Ming JinLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 08 Jun 2019> Earnings vs cash flow (in definition) There is a difference between ""cash (flow) "" and ""earnings"". 
-EBITDA is closely linked to profit
-Free cash flow (FCF) is also linked to profit. However, we are also including aspects of cost of operations and the upkeep of capital.The exclusion of depreciation (D of EBITDA) of the assets in EBITDA is considered in FCF, where cash (from earnings), is expended in the upkeep of assets. > Both FCF and EBITDA measures profitability However, FCF is a stricter way to judge profitability of a company as it includes more aspects of cost.A company can be profitable (EBITDA is positive) but FCF can be negative if operational upkeep is high. If FCF is negative, a company has to sell off noncurrent assets to raise cash to sustain the business.Imagine a family living in a HDB. The HDB is the corporation. EBITDA is total household income less spending on food (because we need food to surivue, which is operating expense in the case of a company. FCF is the income that is left after we take into account expenses that also includes cleaning up the house (detergents, soap, cost to fix leaky pipes etc; which care costs to upkeep coprate operations). Thus the word ""free"" in FCF- because the household is (almost) free to spend whatever FCF, while the household still has other bills to pay from EBITDA.0 comments0"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Hello!They are different ways of looking at the earnings generated by a business. FCF is a measure as representatice of the level of unencumbered cash flow that a firm has to work with. While for EBITDA, it represents the company's earnings before taking into account expense such as depreciation and interest payment. EDITBA may be a better measure when used to compare the performance of different companies.hope this helps!0 comments0"
3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Free Cash Flow is used more for valuing a company since it is the cash flow that is availible to the claimants of the firm. This is why it is used for valuing a company in a discounted cashflow analysis, since this is the cash flow not tied up in the operating activities of the firms, but the cashflow that belongs to the firms claimants. There are 2 forms of free cash flow, unlevered and levered. Unlevered FCFF is to both debt and equity holders and levered is to equity holders only. EBITDA, as Sandra mentioned, is very different. It is more of a profitability measure, and a measure to gauge operating cashflows, as compared to free cash flow. Both metrics are very helpful in valuing a firm, but they both tell different stories.0 comments0"
4,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Mar 2019EBITDA measures the company's market value and liquidity and not the cash generated by the firm. On the other hand, FCF refers to the cash flow for discretionary spending by the management/shareholders. EBITDA is a common measure for comparing firms due to its simplistic nature. The FCF gives a more complete picture as EBITDA ignores capital expenditure.FCF = EBITDA - Cash Tax - Cash Interest - Change in Working Capital - Capital Expenditure0 comments0"
