Volatility for REITs is extreme too, since its so concentrated. There's been some write ups looking at market volatility for these REITs being higher than the STI ETF, which already has pretty unacceptable volatility for its return. "

Because the situation differs greatly with each question. If FRS, just put into CPF OA for 2.5% interest. If not, the other accounts works although slightly less interest rate"

Furthermore, now is the best time to buy up some assets due to the market conditions.1) Learn more about investments and managing your own funds. Upon which calculate up the safety amount depending on your risk profile and establish a safety net i.e 300k. An example would be parking about 200k in a safe index such as the STI which you know will give you back around 280k in the future. Of course you do not put all your eggs in one basket. The example above is just for explanation purposes to help you understand better. The remaining 100k invest diversely into the various markets or funds for a possibility of an upside return. This however, consumes quite a lot of your time and with the lack of experience, can be a little risky2) Research on fund managers and invest the a bit of money that is required to pay for their services and allow them to manage your funds. This is the safer option due to the fact that they are professionals and are paid to manage your funds. Of course do your job and do regular check ups on your fund manager and follow your own market closely.3) FD is definitely a very safe option. However, the returns that banks give can be better especially if you take singapore's inflation into account. My company has launched a new product that gives around 3% per annum for a fixed single premium for 3 years which I feel would be much better than the banks. The downside to this however is that you must either be a existing AIA customer or a new AIA customer as the company views it as a reward for people who has gone that extra mile to be financially savvy and safe and of course to promote the company. I've attached the images of the policy below for your referral as well. If you require any further clarifications or should you have any questions, feel free to contact me at kzin_htoo@aia.com.sg.
