God of WisdomAnswered on 01 Jul 2019If I knew someone was trying to get a reaction out of me, I would probably not have any reaction regardless of the figure.In the face of death, serious illness, etc, your salary ceases to have much meaning and your time left with your loved ones will matter more. That is the one true equalizer in our lifetimes. When your time is up, it is up.
Besides, if you earned X and spent 101% of X, you'll be broke regardless.0 comments15"

1. Make you envious, 
2. Start of progress to sell you MLM
3. try to attract you (>vo)If 1, can ignore cause it’s probably a sign of insecurity. If you are really close, you can act “wow” and ask for treat, but pity them inside for their insecurity. If you really dislike this person, try to sell them some product.If 2, ignore, if you ask for treat they might invite you for an MLM event. But... if free meal...3? Up to you.Actually there is a possibility that they don’t know what they are doing is showing off. Cause after reflection, I realise did this before, but it was regarding my savings not salary. I was actually sharing cause I was feeling abit insecure about my financial situation (after retrenchment exercise in 2008) didn’t think it was considered “show off”. My friend later privately told me not to talk about money during meet ups. So if you think this is a possibility and you are close enough. You can remind them nicely. Maybe you could phrase it like “don’t make yourself a target.”2 comments2"
3,"T@Takingstock @04 Jul 2019Agree I thought about my behaviour and someone else I know, I believe talking about salary is probably unintentional, and the person is probably just feeling insecure in some way.

It could even be a harmless question to probe if she is matching ""average"", ""below average"", or even feeling lost and lonely in some way.Serene Toh05 Jul 2019It’s one of those questions that don’t translate well, cause we are not able to judge the emotions of the person the poster is questioning about. Would be helpful, if poster can describe the way the Friend “boast” and the words used, that made them think it’s boasting."

Jokes aside, money is only one aspect of things. A person's character and integrity are much more important traits in a friend.
Besides, if you found yourself in a situation in desparate need of money one day, would this friend pass you the money you need? Food for thought.0 comments1"
