1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Mar 2019FB's core platform is at a stage where it finds regulations catching up the tech giant. From the Cambridge Analytica Scandals to even the recent New Zealand shootings, FB is under prime spotlight apart from several countries hitting FB with fines of their own.However I am and still remain a bull for FB. Its simple. Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram. With the aggressive ad monetisation of Instagram, FB's Q4 closed the year with 55billion dollars of advertising revenue up 37% from 2017's 40 bil. While Costs increased 51% to 30billion, net income increased to 22billion, representing a 39% with decreased effective tax rates and EPS of 7.38 from 5.39 the previous year.With FB messenger and Whatsapp taking a big share of the world's text messaging market, and Instagram's social media dominance, I believe FB's advertising core will remain relevant in the years ahead by businesses, generating consistent cashflows for the company. For how huge the cash resources the tech giant has and its immense growth track, I am deeply surprised it is merely trading at 18x forward PE.  For some perspective, Google has a foward PE of 25, Netflix at 56 while Amazon at 60. With Apple hit by shrinking Iphone sales, it still sits at 15x forward pe. Therefore I feel it is just a matter of time before regulation issues subside and  the market recognises its undervaluation, giving the stock massive upside potential0 comments4"
2,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Mar 2019From an operational point of view, FB is one of the strongest companies. Apart from a positive revenue growth rate, FB has alot of free cash flow ($41.2 billion) which will allow it to fund its future expansion plans. The company is also operating its business with zero debt, utilising only its equity capital. This removes any risk associate with debt and gives facebook plently of headroom and ability to raise debt if needed in the future. Facebook is current trading at 18x forward earnings, giving it a PEG ratio of 1. A PEG ratio of less than 1 is considered undervalued, while not undervalued, FB has the lowest PEG ratio compared to its competitors Netflix (1.6) and Amazon (1.7). In the long run, I believe FB's strong balance sheet and higher ARPU (average revenue per users) and growth in overseas market (in terms of daily average users) will help the stock rebound despite the privacy and security issues and rising itnerest rates.0 comments2"
