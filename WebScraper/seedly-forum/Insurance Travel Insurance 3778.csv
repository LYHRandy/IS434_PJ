1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 18 Jun 2019Definitely. Hospitalisation plan in Singapore only covers for singapore-based hospital (and only emergencies for overseas that is tied to the cost in Singapore)Not only that, travel insurance covers many other areas, such as loss of personal belongings, flight delays, injuries, illness, natural disaster, flying a loved one over in unfortunate event, etc. They are two very different plan types.You should always get a travel insurance when travelling. Let your loved ones know which company you got from too, in case the unfortunate happens.0 comments5"

Your Integrated Shield Plan is meant for hospitalization stays in Singapore. Yes, we have an emergency outpatient benefit but hospitalization is not the only concern when travelling overseas.Travel insurance covers so much more. Loss of belongings, medical reimbursement due to accident that may not end up as hospitalization, repratriation benefit, and plenty more.Always get your travel insurance. It's not costly either. Just plan it as part of the expense when travelling. Better safe than sorry.0 comments2"
