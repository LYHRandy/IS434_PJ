Assuming you got the integrated shield plan with rider, the next thing you should look at is income replacement in the event you are unable to work. That can be disability or illnesses. At the same time, do check if your parents has hospitalisation coverage too as they will definitely be more prone to illnesses, if they don’t you will want to encourage them to get or get for them if they can’t afford it.Think of your loved ones in financial planning too. Otherwise your finances may take a hit if something happens to them too. Many of my friends has prevented this from happening to them, simply by ensuring their parents have integrated shield plan with rider too. ☺️0 comments3"

God of WisdomAnswered on 23 Apr 2019Next would be income protection in the event of a critical illness. Also called Critical Illness Cover.Rule of thumb would be to cover yourself for 5 X of your annual income. You can purchase this for a term till retirement or 70-75, or as part of a Whole Life plan where you only pay 20-25 years and receive coverage for life.This is to make sure you have 5 years of your salary prepared on the side so you can focus on recovery and pay for any additional costs of treatment not covered by your H&S plan.0 comments0"

Tips: If you prefer agent serving, may consider old school using own agent . If prefer using IFA (independance Financial Advisor) that doesn't depends on a particular company for commission and thus unbiased recommendations, you can try Moneyowl.0 comments0"
