1,"Daniel LeeLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Promiseland is an IFA firm and as such, they do not carry any products of their own. Instead, they are a distributor for more than over 40+ financial institutions ranging from insurance companies, banks and investment firms. ​While the company is around for quite some time, IMO the company itself is really just like other IFA firms which behaves like the middle man for the IFA representatives that's rendering the financial advice to consumers. At the end of the day, given that IFA firms have the same level of access to the financial markets, it is the quality of planning and advice that the individual advisor renders that matters and less so about the company and products. ​Within the company itself, you will find people with different expertise, some choosing to specialize in insurance only while others choosing to focus on investments. Very rarely you will find individuals who are willing to spent the time and effort to do full planning which is similar to the level of advice and service that the high net worth enjoys in the private banking sector.​Bottomline: rather than focusing on the product, you should find out more about the advisor's philiosphy and rationale for recommending the retirement planning product and how does it value add to your friend's retirement plan. Why prioritize product A over product B? Why are you looking at this category of products (annuity) rather than constructing an investment portfolio (dividend strategy) to provide for his retirement needs? These are some of the more important question that i would suggest you find out! ​disclaimer: I'm a representative of promiseland independent. So if there's anything you would like to clarify about the company you can just ask me directly. ​​2 comments1"

I'm curious to know how different is promiseland from other IFAs eg Finexis, Providend etc?Daniel Lee07 Jul 2018To be very honest with you, there really isn't a huge difference between IFA firms IN MY OPINION. If I would to give you an analogy, it would be like comparing multiple chicken rice stall. At the end of the day, the owners and chef are all whipping out the same type of dish using similar main ingredients - in this case, the chicken (duh). But why is it that a same type of dish tastes so different between the different stalls? At the end of the day, it is the skill of the chef that will make or break the taste of the dish, the type of ingredients he/she selects, the type of chicken he/she chooses, the l... (more)"
3,Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Jul 2018Seems to be another IFA? Haven't directly heard about them or met anyone who is a client of theirs yet...!​Also seems to be around since 1986 so that's around 32 years of experience. That's not a short time indeed.0 comments1
