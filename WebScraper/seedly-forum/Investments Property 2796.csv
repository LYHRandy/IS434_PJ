MasterAnswered on 14 Feb 2019Firstly, whats your definition of safe stocks?Secondly, Do you currently have the amount that is sufficient for your housing expense? Or still saving up for it?Suggestion: There are no such thing as safe stocks. Do note that Investment returns are never guaranteed but your housing expense in the future is. If you are able to take up some risk, perhaps apportion about 50% to 70% of  the fund is lower risk products such as SSB, Fixed Deposit, Citibank Maxigain, or Single Premium Endowment Plans offered by Insurers from time to time. With the remaining fund, perhaps you can consider placing it in REITS or Defensive Industries to reduce your loss should a crisis occur0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2018The “safe stock” option is risky because we do not know the market conditions in 5 years however 5 years is a good time frame. ​i think putting it into the market is a good idea to either gain dividend payouts for 5 years or capital gains if the stock rises ​it it would be good to spread the risks out between capital gain stocks ETF and maybe some REITS 0 comments0"

If recession or market correction hits, when you want to fund your housing, you might have to wait awhile for it to stabilize.
