No point paying extra interest. The faster you pay off, the money gets back into your parents CPF account which in turn will grow at the prevailing CPF rates.0 comments3"
2,"Sharon LeeLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated 4d agoI would recommend lump sum, I used to pay 100$ monthly and that was because i couldnt pay it in full. Why pay additional interest right? Even though the money goes back to your parents cpf.
BUT what if you are someone who is pretty good with investing and using that 4k will earn back more than 3% per annum? Then you should just stick with monthly.0 comments1"

5,"WendyLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 3d agoWould say that if you can afford it, to pay off the amount in one lump sum. This will prevent the accrual of interest and once you have cleared this off, going forward, you won't have to put aside money each month to clear your loan and is free to put your money into better use, to either save the money and build your emergency funds, or to invest it. The best thing is, you won't have to think about the loan anymore!0 comments0"
6,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered 2w agoIn my days, we could request to pay more on the loan monthly repayments. I believe it is still the same, you can go to the CPF portal and there's probably still a request somewhere you can update your intended monthly repayment (I did a brief check on the CPF FAQ, and it said so).I don't think you have to take the problem bluntly as either 100 monthly or 4000 in a lump sum. How about considering about 350 monthly (should be within one year), or 250 monthly (should be less than 1.5 yrs), maybe a partial lump sum and then 100+ monthly? There could be so many options. Unlike banks, CPF is glad to take your payments anytime... The key consideration is whether you are comfortable with what you have left in your bank balance and / or monthly cashflows.Choose something you are comfortable with.0 comments0"

I would like to advise you about the CPF education scheme.The interest rates (pegged to CPF OA interest rates) would have started from the time the money was withdrawn, if financially possible, I would suggest paying off the loan as soon as possible (within your financial means).That means if you have the cash to pay off all of the loan. Do pay it off immediately!2 comments0"
8,"Question Poster2w agoWould you recommend the same for someone who just started working and finally managed to accrue some savings? If paid by monthly instalments, the total amounted interest over 3/4 years seems to be $300 extra. Would that be worth it? Paying off 4k seems to be a huge blow to the savings I’ve accrued so far... :( Thanks in advance, appreciate it.SLSamuel Lee2w agoAs Takingstock has previously mentioned, there is the option to pay more per month in order to clear your loan faster. That being said, I would be able to provide a clearer analysis with a detailed cash flow analysis."
