1,"Joseph SimLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 30 Jul 2018New ETF (E.g. Nikko AM ETF bond) does not fall under bank’s IPO category even though it’s having a public offering. To purchase it, you have to go to the Bank’s trading arm (E.g. DBS Vickers, UOB Kay Hian, etc).​Call up the Bank’s trading arm and speak to their broker to sign up. Payment can be done via EPS or Giro but be sure to do it before the offer period ends as GIRO takes time. 0 comments0"
