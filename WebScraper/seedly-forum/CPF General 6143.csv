1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 01 Jul 2019Yes she can. Once you are 55, you can withdraw OA/SA anytime if you have set aside FRS. However, do note that any cash top ups would be distributed to the 3 CPF accounts in the allocation that is designated for her age band.3 comments4"
2,"See all 3 comments EEva30 Jun 2019So any cash top up does not necessary means it’s profitable since we can’t choose with cpf account it’s going to? Or do you think it’s still worth to top up for the interests?Elijah Lee01 Jul 2019It would definitely be worth topping up to get the interest since it is risk free. Although you can't choose which account it is going to, if your medisave account is at the ceiling, your top up monies will still be directed to SA and OA which you can then withdraw."
