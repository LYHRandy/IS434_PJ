1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 31 Jul 2019I cannot underestimate the value of internships in areas which you have an interest in expanding into, especially if you are finding that recruiters might be overlooking you because of the diploma. Real work experience counts for alot, and a glowing review by your manager would definitely add to your resume.0 comments1"

Nonetheless, if you are looking for interim jobs as you are figuring out what to do next, you might want to look for jobs that give you better exposure / enable you to talk to more people. Such jobs could be doing sales and exposing yourself to people from all walks of life, interning at an industry of your choice, doing admin stints in multiple companies etc.
Hope this helps!0 comments0"
