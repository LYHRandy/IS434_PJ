1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018What is your purpose for signing into an endowment plan in the first place? Saving up for a big ticket item down the road? Retirement? Or just a form of ""forced"" savings?​Personally, I won't recommend getting into endowments or any retail wealth management products out there, including ILPs/unit trusts/mutual funds. They cost too much to put in and you get paltry returns in the end. ​As alternatives to endowment plans, considering buying into Singapore Savings Bonds, or leaving a standing instruction to ""force transfer"" a sum of money each month into an account giving higher interest, such as POSB's SAYE, CIMB's FastSaver, or Citibank's Maxi Gain. You can also buy into a bond ETF through POSB's Invest Saver programme each month at minimally S$100. ​Hope this helps. 0 comments2"

5,"Huang Yixuan08 Oct 2018Isn't SSB's returns about 2.4% over 10 years? The FA said the returns for the endowment plan is about 4%.Loh Tat Tian13 Nov 2018The 4% is non-gauranteed. Another birth right you may wish to look at is maximising your CPF-OA / SA for the 3.5%/5% interest first (for the first $60,000), since you are almost willing lock up for so long lol."
6,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Oct 2018As a FA myself, i try to educate my clients on what is available on the market to provide them with a better understanding of the finance/invesment world.​Before you decide to take up an endowment plan, do ask yourself some questions:1) How long do you want to save for?2) What is the purpose of the money? If its for retirement, CPF SA's returns are 4% guaranteed, FYI3) How much aside do you have to commit, and are you able to service it comfortably?4) What is your Risk Profile?5) How does your overall portfolio look like?​Endowment Plans are still suitable for a very specific group of people, so before you enter into it, do take some time to think about it.​You may PM me at https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chen should you require more clarifications​0 comments0"
