1,"Leslie Koh, Associate Financial Services Manager at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 3d agoI would ask you to consider 2nd hand/refurbished laptops. There are a few sellers on Qoo10 that you can consider. I had the same requirements as you and bought mine for $500 and has served me well for the last 2 years.0 comments3"

6,"Jervis Quek, Financial Consultant at Prudential SingaporeLevel 2. RookieAnswered 3d agoPersonally, I would recommend the iPad based on your usage needs. I am heavily reliant on the iPad for my own work, which involves reading of documents and web browsing as well. So far the experience has been rather intuitive, and I do own a bluetooth keyboard and the Pencil as well, and the pencil's great for annotating documents neatly and even you can even use the right apps (highly reco. Goodnotes) to draw mindmaps and take notes easily. Keyboard comes in handy when there's a need to draft longer documents and emails as it is much more comfortable typing on a physical keyboard. The new updated iPadOS even allows you to connect your mouse to aid you, and also to connect external storage such as flash drives as well.Budget-wise, a basic iPad would set you back by around $500, and you can add on the other accessories over time based on what you need. I timed my purchase of accessories such as the Pencil together with my credit card application, so I manage to get $100 credit to offset the cost, you can check out shopback and moneysmart for such promotions to maximise benefits and discounts while making such purchases as well.
Hope you find a suitable and efficient work companion soon! :)1 comment1"

I'm not sure you can find something powerful & brand new with $600 though unless you are looking for something 2nd hand. Less than $1000 might still be possible for brand new.Edit: My notion of powerful might be different from yours. Bought a brand new asus laptop last dec for around $1100.Do keep note of your requirements and also consider if the budget is more important or if flexibility is more important, so that you are firm during your purchase. For reference, I tried to think like you and budget $1000 for a brand new laptop / tablet. I've bought a laptop last year with a firm notion of what I need it for, home use only, rejecting a tablet as more of a ""want"" than a ""need"". However, 7-8 months down the road, I realised that I should have bought a tablet with keyboard instead, as it more useful for work. I work in the design industry, so a tablet would be more convenient than stacks of paper. It'll also conveys a more professional hi-tech feel. Still Ok for me not to buy the tablet this 1-2 years but based on the digitalisation in my industry, looks like I have to get a tablet soon.
So do think carefully about your needs. And make your your 'needs' are really 'needs' and your 'wants' are really 'wants' (or at least won't turn into 'needs' within 1-2 years)0 comments1"
9,"Alex Chua Cheng En, Pcme at Anderson Junior CollegeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated 3d agoYour problems is conflicting and vague so I just give you in point form followed by advice which is   do your MATH. Define what is your work to give a better adviceIpad is a complementary of laptop not a replacement. There are some some Web or apps that are not phone or tablet friendly (main)I infer that you want a light, long battery life laptop. You want a touchscreen too. Low processing  + cheap graphic card (need for your video editing and presentation)
Your consideration :
1. Light - - - how heavy you want? Light = expensive
2. I3 with  normal graphic card. Default recommendation  I5
3. MIN : 8GB ram
4. 256 ssd >>> 1TB hdd. Ssd is more stable, longer shelf life  and higher processing speed. Do your math and INVEST on your laptop. 
You get a cheap paper laptop of $600 or second hand laptop that last for less than a year. Vs a good decent laptop of $1500 that use for more than 3 year.  Cheap scrub laptop costs $50 per month vs good decent laptop that cost about $40 per month? Tell me which one is a wiser and more affordable choice?? In conclusion, know your needs and preferences. Save by waiting for Dec IT Fair, or the current leveno discount. Thinkpad is a decent choice. Do your basic +-*/. It also tell you how much should you save per day till the IT fair1 comment0"

12,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered 6d agoBuy 2nd hand. its the best value for money.Sim Lim Square has many retailers specialising in refurbished laptop. They took old laptops IN BULK from overseas, format the HDD and reinstall new windows. These are really value-for-money. Especially since they usually are able to fix any problems you can find within a week of using.Carousell may have good deals especially from people who are keen to sell their old laptops quickly.Old laptops can still be very fast if you add in cheap rams, again, most refurbisher merchants can add these rams cheaply.0 comments0"
13,"William LimLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 1w agoI would highly recommend Microsoft Surface. Now surface pro 7 is out and most places are giving good offers for pro 6. Can get the i5 with 256GB. If you are getting something like a Surface Pro please only get Microsoft brand as the support and accessories are much much better. If normal laptop with a keyboard, I think any brand can do pretty well.0 comments0"
