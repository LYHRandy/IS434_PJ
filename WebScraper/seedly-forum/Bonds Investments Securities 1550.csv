God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Always a good to have to provide some negative correlation with your equity holdings. If you're already investing in funds, you can look to invest in investment grade or high quality bond funds to complement your portfolio. Other than SSBs, buying individual bonds will require a high quantum and you'll be exposing yourself to concentration risk on just a few bonds.So buy a fund instead to hold hundreds to thousands of bonds.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019People invest in bonds because of the stability in terms of the coupon pay out and less fluctuations Usually these bonds need a large amount of capital If you want to diversify at a lower capital then consider SSB or bond etfs0 comments1"

There are government bonds, corporate bonds and high-yield bonds. However, you can consider the CPF Special Account as similar to government bonds.  Therefore, you should only consider corporate bonds or high-yield bonds as part of an overall investment portfolio.0 comments0"
