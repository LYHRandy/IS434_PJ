1,"HC TangLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019hi Like you have shared:​Pre-conditions:  Electrical Degree but now in IT job (since 2018) and love programming.Current job:  Developer (Coding)Pros:  good place to learn, good boss and colleagues will to guide / share , superior. Cons: Low salary. ​Analysis: Still young, degree and work / skill in different field, but happy with current job. ​Suggestion:1) Because of :  Electrical Degree but now in IT job and love programming + still young and good place to learn, good boss and colleagues will to guide / share , superior => Stay on and learn for at least 3 years ( to gain skill / experience in development / IT)2) As there's no lfetime employment and sooner or later you'll be bored with the job / work and seeking to move higher or some structure change with the company etc and sometimes there isn't any suitable opportunity for you to learn more.=> Move on to next job, higher skill / level to gain more experience / skills and increase of salary. 3) Within the next 2 years, pick up more depth in the current coding, skills, learn more into full stack development, more about IOT and others, go for more cert / skill courses  => To upskill to increase your value and market worth. ​Hope the above helps. All the best. Cheers! Welcome to  ""hello world "" haha! 2 comments5"

3,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Jul 2018We ran a discussion about this once! Most people rated a good boss as the number 1 factor to growing and retention. People want to feel challenged but at the same time have a good nurturing environment to grow themselves over time as well.​However, you seem to be in a quarter life crisis state at the moment. Hence I will bring to you a very important concept in life called the Ikigai. A term for 'reason of being'. I found this to be exceptionally intriguing, particularly in today's fast paced world. Do you think that your current job which exist for you is at your Ikigai?​It's an idea that helps you decide when you choose your job. Do you only choose one that you love? or the one that pays the most? How do you actually find the center of it all?​​​​""It’s all too easy to fall victim to silo-ed thinking, that our job, family, passions, and desires are all separate and unrelated aspects of our lives. The fundamental truth of Ikigai is that nothing is silo-ed. Everything is connected.""​You can find out more about this concept in detail here:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrismyers/2018/02/23/how-to-find-your-ikigai-and-transform-your-outlook-on-life-and-business/#23bee3e32ed4​Most importantly wishing you a good life ahead and never settle, keep going until you find that Ikigai!

5,"Pascal Samsoon, MBA Candidate at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 Aug 2018This is equivalent to asking if you should choose bulbasaur or charmander or squirtle.​Joke aside. ​You shared some valid points. And you seemed to be self-aware. That's good. ​To address your concern, here are 3 tips that I try to practice myself...Set your target Manage your expectationsStrategize - Execute - Iterate Firstly, understand your company and your own self. What is the target you wish to achieve? Where does it plateau? How far are you from the plateau stage? As you know, you can move vertically or horizontally. There are way more other type of experience you could probably get in your current company. All I know is that you would know this better. Thus, set your own target. ​Secondly, manage your expectations and manage other people's expectations. It is a tug of war and it is a battle. Don't give up. This stage is what you will undergo during your journey towards your target plateau stage. Be both a taker and a giver. Because you will learn the most by giving, and not just taking. Thus, manage your expectations and you will know/figure out what to do. ​Third and finally, always strategize and be fast to execute. Most importantly, know when to iterate on your plan to restrategize and then go back into execution mode. As such, there is little chance you will get stuck in a comfort zone. If you do, you are not iterating fast enough. ​Hope it helps​Cheers,Pascal from Time to first byte​​0 comments0"

7,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Jul 2018Well, it depends. There are many people who can advise you on this, but every opinion, including mine, is tainted with their own experiences, successes, and regrets. At this current moment, you have to weigh what is the most important factor you want, and how far are you willing to go to sacrifice the others for it?However, specific to your situation, I think it's a little strange that you only allow yourself 2 options- Stay comfortable here or leave to find something else. Could you perhaps also speak with your superior the urge to learn more, or be challenged more? It's possible that because you were not from the IT background that your boss is holding off too many new things for you, so that you can learn. Maybe your boss thinks you can improve on some things before assigning greater responsibility to you.What I'm saying is that there are ways that you can have all 3 of these, and they are not mutually exclusive. Be open minded, it sounds like you have a good team and a good boss, I'm sure they are open and available to yo0 comments0"

9,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Jul 2018IMHO, you're too lucky and young.​You mentioned you left your previous job in Q42017, so you've been in the new job for max 10 months? If you are feeling like you're in your comfort zone, it's either you have no idea of what you don't know or you have yet to try new things.​Let me explain why I'm saying this.​Firstly, I don't think there's anyone who can fully understand the organization, processes or systems used within it in 10 months. I'm talking about those that are relevant to your work. Maybe you think you know; but try digging deeper. You'll find something interesting. Secondly, even if you do know everything; is there any new initiative that you can propose? Because with all your knowledge from school and work experience (practical), I would think this is a great training ground. Try, test, review, propose, fail and repeat.​Annual increment of 1-3%, where is this data from? When I was younger and I was given the same answer from colleagues + HR but to be honest the majority won't be you if you are different and you won't be telling the difference in this case if you know what I mean.​It's not easy to find a place where culture is good and supportive plus you get to learn what you are not skilled in but very interested in. Even if you were to jump to other companies for the pay increment; people would be asking why are you leaving and what would be your answer? Let's not forget that you would also be undertaking a new risk by then; risking culture, good boss and team for a slightly higher salary.​Lastly, most recruiters will come to you with promise of higher pay than now and even tell you about expected year end bonus. Don't bother with it because projected year end bonus are usually subjected to company's performance year on year and it's not guaranteed. Please do not be swayed by $$..​Hope this helps!0 comments0"
10,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jul 2018Opportunity to learn, to try, to express idea, to execute is hard to come by. There are many ways to increase your income, don't restrain just the active income on your day job. As you grow older, you realise that we want passive income to be financially free. ​​​0 comments0"
11,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Jul 2018If it was me, I will choose to stay. But it is personal decision. I experience many retrenchment so I know job not easy to find, retrenchments alot. If you think you are able to find a better job, go out and secure one before jumping ship.​Maybe I am paranoid, maybe I haven't experienced a stable job or good job before so what I share might be too pessimistic0 comments0"
