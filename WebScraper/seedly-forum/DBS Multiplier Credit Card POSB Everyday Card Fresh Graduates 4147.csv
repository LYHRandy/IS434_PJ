Like SPC and Sheng Siong for the high cashback. Bills is only 1% and everything else is only 0.3%. Which means that if you use the card for any other transactions like online shopping you only get 0.3%.I'm currently using DBS Livefresh Card. 5% rebate for Online spending (capped at $20) and also 5% for paywave transactions (also capped at $20). But minimum spending of $600/mth. If you are unable to hit the min spending it'll be 0.3% (same as POSB Everyday)0 comments0"
