No amount of money can ever replace losing a loved one.I would really suggest you speak to a financial advisor, someone you trust, someone that can look at things objectively. You need to make this money last. Try not to take too much risks with it. I would also suggest that you top up your own insurance now as well, since you're the only one left that can take care of the family. Start by budgeting this money. How much do you need it and when. For your kids, if they're studying here, 500k definitely would be enough. If they're planning to go overseas, and it's still some time away, try forecasting how much it would cost. For 2 or 3 kids, all overseas, 500k could actually be too little. So really draft out a roadmap or timeline. Things would be clearer for you. If you don't have any advisor in mind, I could be of assistance. I lived in a single parent household, 1 other sibling growing up, but now have a 3 year old sister here as well. I'm doing the exact same planning for my household. Mom is still the one providing for my baby sister and growing up we're lucky nothing happened to her. Mom didn't have any windfall but we're confident that my baby sister can go to school without taking on debt and worry and my mom can still retire comfortably.0 comments0"
