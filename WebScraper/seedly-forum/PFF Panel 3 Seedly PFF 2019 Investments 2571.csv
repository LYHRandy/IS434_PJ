1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hi anon, I think any particular developed economy with stable levels of inflation, growth and interest rates are a good sign of a country that are safe to invest in, given that your stocks are not subjected to too much macroeconomic market risks/volatility that affect all stocks in the country's exchange. An extremely good example is our very own Singapore, with relatively price stable stocks that pay good dividend rates, especially for REITs. These are all strong indicators of ""safer"" securities. Of course, it still depends on your own risk adversion level. If you have to go very safe, perhaps well known Blue chip stocks in Singapore/US aregood choices. If not, securities also encompass bonds as well - SGS/SSB bonds almost guaranteed principal given Singapore's budget surplus and strong ability to pay off debt. US Treasuries are also gold standards.0 comments0"
