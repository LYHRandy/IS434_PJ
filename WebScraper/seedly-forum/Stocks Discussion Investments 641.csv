1,Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 25 Aug 2019Full disclosure: I am using IB and have no intimate knowledge on TD.Yes. Singaporeans can buy ETF listed in the US using IB. Please be aware of the 30% dividend withholding tax for US-listed ETFs.9 comments2
2,"See all 9 comments Harvey Tan25 Aug 2019Yes. For IUSD, you need to buy it on the UK exchange, ie London Stock Exchange. In terms of holdings, once again, no difference. However, S27's trading volume is downright abysmal. Furthermore, S27 which trades on SGX, is trading on Singapore timezone. This means that the ETF will not trade as close to its NAV compared to SPY/VOO, because the underlying securities in S27 are US stocks and are traded on US time. I would avoid S27 and either stick with the ETFs listed either in US or UK.John Smith25 Aug 2019Oh ok. So I believe to trade in London Stock Exchange, I would have to check with the broker firm on the necessary forms to fill, etc. just as to trade in US Stock Exchange. For TD, I donâ€™t I can do so. Anyway, many thanks for your fruitful advice. Thanks Harvey !"
