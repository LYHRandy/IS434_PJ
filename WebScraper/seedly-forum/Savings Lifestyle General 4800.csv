1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Hey anon! Here're some ""cheapo stuff"" i've heard of that can help you save a couple of dollars here & there:1) Closing time discount. We've written a comprehensive guide to all the amazing eats you can get due to closing time discount here: https://blog.seedly.sg/closing-time-discount-singapore/. My biggest steal was bagging home the entire roasted chicken at a fraction of the price! heart eyes emoji2) Telegram channels. There're plenty of channels that share promo codes, discounts & deals in SG! We've got a new article summarizing all the Telegram channels you should follow (ours included of course!): https://blog.seedly.sg/telegram-channels-that-every-millennials-singapore-must-have/3) Bulk shopping. Check out Unpackt SG if you haven't! My family managed to save almost $20 in our grocery shopping trip because they sell everything in bulk there. If you didn't know, 30% of what you pay is actually the packaging (e.g. 30% of that $5 peanut butter is the jar. Why not save up your previous jar and go to Unpackt to get their freshly grounded peanut butter with absolutely no preservatives?) . So shopping at bulk food stores with your own containers isn't just environmentally friendly but also really pocket friendly!4) Always ask around & jio others to buy with you! This applies to online purchases. Not only does it help in splitting the delivery fees (better if y'all spend till it's free!), but if your friends have a particular credit/debit card with an ongoing promo for the month, double win!5) Hai Di Lao. Food aside, they have screen protector services, manicure services, free slippers for home wear, hair ties and apparently some nail kit set?6) Thrift shopping. This seems a bit trendy/popular among millennials these days. Not only are we saving money, but we're standing up against fast fashion too!! If the thought of thrift shopping from strangers' clothings scare you, try asking around your circle of friends if they would like to swap with you instead! Recently tried that with a friend and it was pretty fun raiding each other's closets.7) Pay with e-payments to earn from their rewards system!! This is my personal ""cheapo hack"" LOL if merchants accept GrabPay, I'll pay with it immediately. You'll earn the points which are really helpful at 1) helping you retain your status (silver, gold, platinum) and 2) collecting enough points to redeem other stuff! I usually just redeem Grab credits to offset my future rides or redeem some free food (I once redeemed a free XXL fried chicken from Shilin, shiok!!) I personally don't use it but know that FavePay has a similar system for rebates as well (?)8) Not so much on cheapo but financial planning really makes a difference. Ever since I started interning at Seedly, I'm so glad I've learnt the importance and basics to planning my finances. From picking the savings account that can maximise your interests, to the right credit card that rewards you with the best rates of miles or cashbacks. All these little things here and there can really help you to save money in the long run. Good habits to build from young!Hope this helped! :-)0 comments7"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 12 Jun 2019Ah - a subject after my own heart!Guide to Saving a Little Here, a Little There1. Saving a few dollars on transport with walking: If the train stations are 2-3 stops apart, and you are not in a rush - I like to walk from station to station. It definitely helps with digesting your last meal as well!2. Saving at least $2 on drinks by always bringing your own bottle: I find that on days where I do not bring my trusty bottle out, I tend to want to buy something from 7-Eleven, or worse still, bubble tea sans bubbles costing at least $3.3. Saving a few dollars on breakfast, because I don't eat breakfast: Now this is a little controverial, but I have been saving on breakfast costs because I practice intermittent fasting and have not been paying for breakfast expenses for 5 years now. Keeps the pounds off the weighing scale and saves you a few dollars everyday! With this, my goal is IF more than saving money though. It's just a habit I have gotten into.4. Using discount apps for food: I love the Fave app for this purpose. They tend to have some really good food deals now and then, that provides a good meal at an exciting new F&B establishment at discounted prices. Can save a good amount here.5. Buy household essentials in bulk: I am that person that buys 60 toilet rolls at one go for the household. Even my mum baulks at the stash of toilet rolls at home. But I do it because 1. Cost per roll is lower 2. You don't need to manually lug it from the supermarket because with a high basket value, you already can avail free delivery and 3. Shopping for groceries online often avails discount codes, bringing you cost down further. I quote toilet rolls as an example, but this applies to any household essential.6. Turning off the TV: Not only do you save on household expenses, you are also less likely to want to buy things because after all, that is what advertisements are for.7. Borrow books from the National Library: Now this saves me more than just a few dollars, but it takes patience especially when the book you want is not available. I make it my weekly routine to go to the library to borrow books, and have been able to borrow new books that I want to read - thus saving me the effort (and money) to get the books. Additionally, I have one less item at home to deal with, so TRIPLE WIN.8. Share meals: Not practical if you are not good buddies with your colleagues, but I find that sometimes it is cheaper to share meals at food establishments. Especially so for things like Ma La Xiang Guo, where you can get a big pot to split the cost!9. Avoiding malls: Like TV, malls have a great way to make you want to spend money. Some of my friends seem to have an insatiable urge to buy something whenever they are at the mall.10. Have a brutally effective coupon strategy: I like to stack discounts for eg. Stacking Shopback with Fave, or utilising timed-discounts. For eg. Marina Square is currently running some $5 off $10 spend deals at Subway, Sarawak Kolo Mee, Mei Heong Yuen desserts etc. Being eagle-eyed about such deals all contribute to saving you dollars on each meal!0 comments4"

Cheaper and you really won't notice the different with branded ones.Always wait for sales and promo to buy anything. Literally, put stuff in your online shopping cart and wait.0 comments3"
4,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 17 Jun 2019Was thinking to put this in a blog someday, but my own saving tips over the last 12 years (and some are also shared in personal finance books like the 2% rule).Tips in my annual cost reduction programme (CRP)
1) look at your utilities like cable and mobile services. There would be some fees / services you may not use, or able to renew packages for lower cost / better quality at lower cost. I might have made annual savings of > 500 targetting this section every other year.2) look at your insurance premiums. Usually there are monthly, quarterly and annual payments. Its possible to reduce the premium by 10% or more just by switching from monthly to annual one time payment. The interest you earn from the timing difference is immaterial compared to the savings. I might have made annual savings > 600 through this section.3) unlike insurance premiums, iras does not reduce your tax payments if you pay lump sum. Split to monthly and earn additional interest. This is probably not a lot.4) leave enough balance and not pay $10 charges for failed giro deductions and fees.5) pay credit card balances on time and in full. Avoid late fees, extra charges and the worst, 26.8% annual interest on unpaid balances.
This is enormous. 6) Cut your credit limit if you want to control spending. My credit limit is only 3000 and usually enough to cover for two months expenses.7) on clothing, shoes and various, use replacement basis - ie you can only buy a new one if one is spoilt or donated. Keeps inventory low and challenges of you really really really need that new shirt.8) I sometimes find good 2nd hand wear on carousell. I have a benjamin barker shirt bought for $5 because the seller outgrew it. 9) keep your purchasing with one year in advance basis, giving yourself one year time to buy new clothes etc while waiting for the best close store deal.10) for items more than 100, dont buy it immediately. Tell yourself to rethink / revisit a week later. You would have figured if it was a must have or want to have by then.11) accrue for your needs. I accrue 500 per mth in a saving goal called rewards which was meant for travel, or toys / mobiles / cpf top ups or whatever. My whims and fancies are dictated by the balance in this saving goal. Eg if I dont have 3k in there, I dont choose japan as a travel destination.12) I am starting to test mark and spencers clothing. For some reason, I keep throw them in the washing machine and hope they will get ""damaged faster through routine washing"", but after three years of weekly wearing and washing, they still look as good as 3 years ago. I think I need to extend their useful lives from 3 yrs to 10 yrs.7 comments3"

A couple of dollars for drinks every meal will deplete your wallet at a much faster rate as compared to you bringing your own water2) Bring your own plastic container while dabao-ing - Besides saving that $0.20, you get to save the environment too! Killing 2 birds with one stone3) Find online deals - Chope, Favepay, Shopback apps4) Find alternatives to purchasing something you need / want i.e. Carousell etc. 5) Public Transport  Grab - Although Grab might seem enticing, having your personal chaffeur. But if you think about it, 1 Grab ride equates to 5 or even more public transport rides. Therefore, one might wanna reconsider before pressing that ""Book Now"" button0 comments3"
7,"Siow Nan, Electrical And Computer Engineering at NusLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Jun 20191) For online promos - Wait, don't get tempted to make the purchase.. Wait for events where there is a good coupon discount and consolidate your purchase. Alot of times, if you waited, you might overcome the urge to buy and realize that you don't need to make the purchase at all.  It was just a spur of the moment emotion that we can control if we wait. 2) Look out for promos as mentioned by some.  Every cent counts. 3) Relook your bank accounts and configure them for high yield savings and optimize it.  Those interests can help accumulate into bigger savings4) Just discipline and control - Learn from Marie Kondo.  Don't make impulsive buys.
5) Its still ok to indulge a bit once in a while.. We save to be able to spend for our enjoyment sometimes.0 comments1"
8,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 16 Jun 2019Buy things that last & be strategic when you buy. I buy M&S clothes once a year; during the offer period. Their pants & shirts are not only thoughtfully designed but made with good quality cloths and stitchings. I can easily last a year with 2 pant & 2 shirts if I want to lol. I also have a 7 YO laptop; 10 YO backpack which looked pristine new on the outside... until the inside crumbles before I changed it. XD and oh yes, I target bread stores/cake shops after 8pm because they want to clear their stocks and I'm happy to be of help~Don't follow what 'others' do. In my industry, people spends alot on luxuries. I simply do not follow even though there are some who constantly nagged... If I do not have a need for it; I don't pay for it with my money - period. I have better use of my money thanks~Helping others. As a platinium grab member I get drivers pretty quickly. I also have many promotional codes etc. So I'd help my colleagues to book rides and they could save some for the rides + I get to earn points which I can exchange for something else later on. Win win situation.Plan ahead. Buy vouchers + coupons ahead for things you actually purchase full-price. For example I buy breadtalk + toast box vouchers so I save $0.50 for every teh I dabao (BYO & get $0.10 off even) and when I utilize breadtalk vouchers.. I make sure I grab all the breads that's $2 and above to maximize value (any bread $2.10 you pay the differences.MLXG hack. I find places with standard price across for vegs/meats/seafood. Then dabao meat + seafood with broth/sauce home.. add add my own blanched vegetables and share it with my family (you'll be amazed how much you are actually forcing yourself to eat to finish off the food). This saved me sooooo much.Switch your electricity provider. Yes, SP Powers is just not cost effective.Use direct cashback cards. Mile cards works if you're frequent traveller etc. But most of the time they lie inside the a/c. Direct cashback may be limited; but deposit those savings elsewhere and you can watch the interest grow them well.Share subscriptions. For netflix + spotify if you still don't know it.. and or search for free alternatives. For me, on some months I deactivate subscriptions knowing I'm not going to use it and reinstate it next month when I wanna use it. They are pretty standard priced every month anyway so only difference made is to your bank a/c.Be environmentally friendly. Some shops reward BYO (bring your own) while some unwittedly rewards you for doing so. I bring my own cup to the kopitiam for teh-peng and a huge cup usually costs $0.90 more vs small ones. Because I brought a cup ... the person almost always filled it to the brim with no extra costs and my cup's volume is equivalent to the huge cup version.. lol so I saved $20++/month.Buy things in bulk if you can utilize it; and buy things in customized volume if you can't. Unpackt, Scoop stores are great but sometimes wet markets are even better because you save time & costs not travelling in the first place.Get credits only when you get something out of them. Topup grab pay because using grabpay earns you more points and you actually uses it. Get credit cards/loans and pay them in full.Be nice. My chye peng vendor charges me $3 for something he charges my mother $5 for & $4.50 to my sis-in-law who is much more attractive vs me. Nuff said~Be calculative. I used to buy stuffs for colleagues because I want to share the goodies with them; but not everyone is appreciative. So now I limit to the few who actually do reciprocate and not on frequent basis. I also keep track who owe me what and settle by end of the week before I forget. Used to just let it be and it costs me more than what I budgeted for. Sometimes people genuinely forget; sometimes they just conveniently forget._E-pay only if you get something out of it. _For me, I get the convenience. I also save alot from using shopbackgo/fave/chope/eatigo etc. But don't go back to the shops just to utilize the savings. It's not a saving if you have to spend it to use it. This is something it took me a long time to consciously notice everytime I purchase something... but yes, we all know it from every money hacking website ever. Sometimes, lacking cash and epayment modes actually makes you think if it's even necessary in the first place.0 comments0"
