question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Jul 2019I have a Whole life with profits , 2nd series insurance (Prudential), which has been in force since 1990. I am wondering whether I should just surrender the policy to benefit from the cash?I am not in dire need of the cash but am wondering why I need to continue paying an annual premium (more than $2000) for so many years. Will it make sense to get the cash and invest in other insurance-linked policies to enjoy the cash inflow?5 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomUpdated on 15 Aug 2019Your policy right now is almost entering it's 30 yr period. This means that it would have broken even by now and everytime you pay a premium, the policy could be earning a 6-7% return.Because there's a compounding effect on the policy, I suggest you calculate the projected year on year returns from this year onwards. It may be the best low risk product to own at the moment.3 comments4"
2,"See all 3 comments Hariz Arthur Maloy05 Jul 2019Well it is still an insurance policy with a death benefit as its selling factor. So only choose to withdraw from it when you really require the money. And when you do, you can still make a partial surrender instead of a full one to allow money in the policy to still grow. Lastly, you can convert the policy to a paid up policy and not pay premiums on it anymore if you desire.NNinja15 Aug 2019That depends if you want to let the insurance companies use your money to earn more money or you prefer to sell and put the money elsewhere to earn high income or for your own use. You can even buy a million dollar death benefit policy if you‚Äôre concerned on the death benefit. Not an agent myself but I believe AIA has one such policy"

Unless you have other ideas of where to invest the money. And since it is in profit, you can treat it like a plan that still provide you with coverage and at the same time earn a higher interest than your savings account.
When you reach the age range of about 65 to 70 and you do not need the coverage anymore, surrender the policy if you would like to use the cash for retirement purposes. Or leave it to the next generation as legacy.2 comments1"
4,Mary George Cheriyan10 Jul 2019This is so helpful üëç. I will just need to study the coverage again myself. Insurance agents are bafflingly unhelpful. My agent even commented that it's unusual for policy holders to track and inquire into policy coverage and benefits! Others have been blithely apathetic.Vincent Tan Wen Bin11 Jul 2019Thank You!

ProdigyUpdated on 05 Jul 2019If you are not in need of cash, why would you surrender your policy, and put the cash which you have faithfully accumulated over the years in investment risks?If you bought the policy for protection, shouldn't you be keeping the policy, or have your family situation/life stage changed that you felt the protection is no longer needed?1 comment0"
