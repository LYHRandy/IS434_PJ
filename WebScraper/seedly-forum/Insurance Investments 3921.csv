1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Mar 2019NOT more than 10% of your allowance etc part time work etcIf you only concentrate on term insurance plans, it should not cost more than 4% for your age. (unless you are looking at super high coverage of 1million.)As a university student, there is no income to protect, etc etc, I find it hard to advice... because your allowance is meant to be for studies only.0 comments0"
