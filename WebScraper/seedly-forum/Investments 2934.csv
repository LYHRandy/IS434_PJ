question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 Nov 2018What is a cost effective way to purchase foreign countries's index funds?Hi Mr Loo, what is a cost effective way to purchase foreign countries's index funds? I have been purchasing only STI ETF using dollar cost averaging method since 2004. I don't keep track of my returns, but estimate them to be positive. However, reading reviews & experience of other investors, it seems that the performance of STI ETF is lacklustre, as compared to other countries' index funds.Second question, going forward, which/ which countries' index funds would you recommend?1 answerAnswerBump0"
