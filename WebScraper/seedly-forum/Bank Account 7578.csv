1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Jul 2018SSB is a good choice if you intend to keep for 10 years. Else, you can try fixed deposits. The FD rates are rising recently0 comments2"
2,"Daniel LeeLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I second the opinion provided by Gabriel Tham. SSB is a good SAVINGS instrument for the following reasons.​1) it provides the interest rate of a 10 year bond 2) behaves like a saving accounts (withdrawal without penalty)3) $2 transaction cost allows for re-investment especially in an rising interest rate environment. This elimates any interest rate risk that you might encounter in the future. (for every $1,000 invested, it only takes a 0.4% increment in market interest rate to justify switching your old SSB with the newly issued SSB).​While i may not understand your goal of savings, here is my 2 cents based on your what you want. Savings at the end of the day only provides for a low level of return that at best helps consumers match up with inflation rate. Just like a farmer who would rather sell a chicken that doesn't lay eggs than to keep it, there is no incentive for consumers to hold on to cash that does not provide for positive inflation adjusted returns. ​Most importantly, what are you looking to save for? Depending on your answer, just saving instruments alone might not be sufficient. You may want to look into it before fully committing to your current financial plan.​Cheers :) 1 comment1"
3,"Eric Chia18 Sep 2018Also agree with Gabriel and Daniel. Just adding on if you're not looking at SSB, investment or endowment, then the next one would be Standard Chartered e$aver or CIMB FastSaver accounts."
4,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018I'd subscribe to the POSB RSP and put the rest of my money into a good savings account, SSB, as well as fixed deposits! 0 comments0"
5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018Other than SSB, next safest alternatives would be fixed deposits, or high yielding saving accounts like CIMB Fastsaver or Citibank's Maxigain. ​Unless you are prepared to stomach some risk, there's not really a lot of choices available. Do stay away from retail endowment/ILP/annuity products, not worth the investment and opportunity costs..0 comments0"
6,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Though you already know SSB and more into safe deposit, with 1k/monthly for the next 10 years. That's 12k per year for 10 years. Total of 120k. ​Instead of just the passive SSB but and leave it there, can consider buying in a manner similar to DCA but some variations, build a bond ladder. ​Read here : https://kpo-and-czm.blogspot.com/search/label/SSB to find out how it is done and also use the excel build by author to find out it works. It can be set to work like a divident investing machine instead of just a regular bond / savings account. You can reinvest the interest or consider it as your ""monthly dividend""  lol :) ​​​​2 comments0"
7,"Esther Esther07 Feb 2019What's DCA? HC Tang07 Feb 2019Oh it stands for Dollar Cost Averaging. It means monthly invest a fix amount automatically via giro to the investment regardless of situations usually using regular savings plan account. Due to the nature of buying consistently regardless of higher or lower price, averaging it will means cheaper overall. Though is a better methods of investing. "
8,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Putting it into SSB. You can also put it into FD during promotional periods like recently CIMB have promotion rates for their FD min placement of 10k though. Otherwise you can also consider CIMB fastsaver. 0 comments0"
9,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018High interest savings account (e.g. CIMB FastSaver, DBS Multiplier)Fixed deposits Singapore Savings Bond POSB SAYE account These are the safest options to stick with 0 comments0"
10,Nicholas ChanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Can consider index funds since you are doing a 10 year monthly dca. U are highly likely to come out ahead. 0 comments0
11,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Singapore Saving Bond is the best option. 0 comments0
12,Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Jul 2018Consider ssb. You just need to have cdp account and commit minimal $500. Fee is $2 to purchase and $2 if early redeem. No need to pay $2 if you let it run for 10 years. Capital guaranteed too 0 comments0
13,"Jeff YeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jul 2018Stay far far away from endowment plans the returns are too low and time frame too long. ​I think the banking landscape changes from time to time and it is important to review the promotions, rates and move our money around accordingly. ​If you enough cash go go for a Bond, else SSB might be a good choice.​SAYEMaxiGain0 comments0"
14,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jul 2018If you're aged 44-45 and can save that much, the highest risk free interest would literally be your CPF. ​With 1k a month for 10 years compounding, you'd definitely have your FHS and then some, so you'd have a  ton of excess at the end of 10 years as sweet, sweet cash.​Otheriwse, there's really no reason not to go for an endowment if you  plan to save that much. Illiquid savings are far higher yielding than liquid as a general rule, and endowments have been upgrading and performing. You can get endowments that don't require more than 5 years payment and yield anywhere between 2.5 to 3.9% net of fees quite comfortably. ​If you'd like to consider that as an option, you can reach me at https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54.​If you're not convinced and want to see potential proof, you can also reach me there.
