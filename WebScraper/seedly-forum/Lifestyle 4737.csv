1,"Fa ChenLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 23 Jul 2019Its depand on your travel location, where you wants to go. And how much you spend on your journey & shopping. Every countries have different currency. Last Year i went Dubai with my Fmaily its was a awesome trip. Our total trip was under 5000 USD we spent there a lot. But we booked our flight & hotel from Tajawal and we used Tajawal coupon code to get discount on hotel & Flight booking. We saved money on our bookings.0 comments1"

For example, a trip to Japan would cost a few times more than a trip to Laos, for example. Because I usually travel with family and loved ones, I tend to spend more. For example when I bring my dad overseas, I am more likely to spend on nicer hotels and touristy things, as opposed to when I'm by myself. My budget includes paying for family when overseas, so it would be in the five digit range.0 comments1"
3,Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019I am currently putting aside $200+ a month for travelling. So that'd be about $3000 a year. It's enough for me to go on a few short trips (i think).Still trying to figure this adulting thing out though... So the amount i put aside monthly might change! 0 comments1
4,"Ablah KethuLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I love travelling an i am not very much counting on how much i spend on travelling every year but i definitely go for 3 to 4 international trips and small trip in the pool sometimes. It's always a great pleasure to travel and experience and yes, as you have mentioned 5 to 6k? My spending is far higher than that. I have to admit the truth that due to the online travel portals, travelling has become most comfortable for the online shoppers. Just find the trip and book in discounts, that;s it. I would always consider Cleartrip to book the tickets and this might be the reason that i save on my bookings as well using Cleartrip coupon codes.1 comment0"
