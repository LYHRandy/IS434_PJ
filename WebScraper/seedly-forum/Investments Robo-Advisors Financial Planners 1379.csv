1,"Eddy Cheong, Chief Advisory Officer at MoneyowlLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 09 May 2019Thank you, Anonymous, for the question. Essentially both have the same objective of helping clients in discovering their financial needs and providing suitable recommendation so as to achieve their financial goals. The difference is the medium to which you get the advice.The traditional way of getting financial advice is via a human adviser. That is understandable because it has always been the case, until recently with the emergence of robo-advisors. Because money is so personal and involves emotions, aspirations and life decisions, we like to talk to a human adviser who we can relate to. One issue with human adviser is the uncomfortable sales process whereby we might feel the pressure to buy something. Then comes robo-advisers, that essentially have the ability handle complex algorithm to provide advice that is accurate, fast and at your own time. The main issue with robo is that it lacks empathy and human wisdom which is often needed when we talk about money, dreams and trade-offs. Moreover, most of the robos out there are basically investment only, hence not comprehensive in planning approach.There is actually now a third category - Bionic Financial Adviser.Instead of having to choose between a human adviser or a robo-adviser, you can have the best of both worlds with a bionic financial adviser. MoneyOwl is Singapore's first bionic financial adviser. By bionic, it means we combine the precision of tech with the wisdom of human advisers to give you the advice you need.
