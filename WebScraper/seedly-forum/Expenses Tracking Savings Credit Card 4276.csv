You can make use of online comparison sites such as MoneySmart and BankBazzar to compare which card suits him in terms of rewards, amount/percentage of cashback, minimum spending (if any) etc. Usually you'll be able to get some sign up gifts or deals such as getting cash credit for spending a certain amount within the first few months of your card approval. 0 comments0"
