4,"Terence AngLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 14 Jun 2018Besides all the comments before me already, I would say don't look at Cryptocurrency as an investment, but rather the technology behind any crypto you decide to purchase. As always, do your due diligence before you buy into any coins.​Also, only invest crypto IF:1) You have a lot of spare cash - Don't know where else to put money, then ok loh2) Your risk appetite is huge AF - If you're not prepared to lose 20 to 50% in a day, don't bother​Whether it is a 'good time' to invest, it really depends. I would say now is pretty good because everything is pretty low compared to the hype last December/early Jan. It's the usual patterns where crypto rises at the end of year and declines after.​0 comments0"
5,"Ric Wang Poh PengLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 12 Jun 2018When you mean invest, do you mean long term holding of the tokens? Or just speculating the highs and lows? ​If you have a huge risk appetite and clearly understand the usage of the tokens. Go ahead and try with your spare money. ​Due to its speculative nature, it is highly volatile, do be prepared to see the net asset value of your tokens to go up and down every few days by senstational news, but it’s still up to you to see in the future are they all worth it 0 comments0"
