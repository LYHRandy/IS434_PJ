question,"DBS Multiplier POSB Everyday Card Credit Card Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 May 2019I am a fresh grad interested in maximising my interest with DBS Multiplier! I have two basic questions on the investments and credit card categories of the account. ?I wish to get the POSB Everyday card. However I do not wish to pay the $192 annual fee, and intend to use the card just to satisfy the multiplier criterion ($1 per month). How likely will my annual fee be waived? Understand that itâ€™s common practice to call to request annual fee waiver. I roughly understand the concept of Unit Trusts but navigating the dbs website throws me off. Can anyone share a basic framework on how to approach UT investing with DBS?2 answersAnswerBump1"

You may referring to this http://sgbeyourownboss.com/dbs-3-8-high-interest-saving-account/. For investment, you can consider POSB Invest-Saver, or buying SSB. The dividend credited in your DBS account will be counted.0 comments0"

I also spent close to nothing on their card, still waived. Process to waive also super easy. Now everything is done in ibanking. just fill in a form, 2-3 clicks, and its sent in. Wait few days, it should be waived.For unit trusts, I personally do not recommend getting from banks. They typically charge a high sales fee. My guess is you are trying to fulfill the investment criteria, and for this I recommend Singapore savings Bond. Buying singapore savings bond consecutively for 6 months and you will be getting interest for every month. This will trigger the investment category of multiplier account. Minimum to buy singapore savings bond is $500, fee is $2. Backed by sg govt so its pretty safe.0 comments0"
