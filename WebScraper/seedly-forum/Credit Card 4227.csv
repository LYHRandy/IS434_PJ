1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jan 2019Depends on what you spend most on. For big purchases, Maybank FC barcelona and  amex true cashback card and SC unlimited cashback are good. Citi SMRT is also pretty good cashback for groceries, fast food, cinemas, online shopping and even EZ reload. POSB Everyday is also another alternative.0 comments0"
