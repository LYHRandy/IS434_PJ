1,"Tan Siak Lim, CFP. Director, Financial Advisory Group at Financial AllianceLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 Aug 2018The new Raffles Shield plan has a few unique features. One is to buy up a higher deductible so that the premium is cheaper. Currently, that is the cheapest premium available. This high deductible can be claim from group insurance assuming the insured currently has one. When the person retires or goes to another company without group insurance, he can lower the deductible, and as I understand, no underwriting is necessary.0 comments0"
