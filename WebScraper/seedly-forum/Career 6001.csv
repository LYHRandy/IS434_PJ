1,"Guo Hao TeoLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yeah I think this is seen to be quite common practice in most companies in Singapore? i.e between locals and foreigners it looks something like this for a same level manager.For a Local:Gross: $3kTake home: $2.4kCPF Employee + Employer: $600 + $510 = $1,110
Total = $3,510For a foreigner:Gross: $3,510Because they factor in that amount with the (20% + 17%) of gross salary which is quite a huge sum actually.2 comments3"
