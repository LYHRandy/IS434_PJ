God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yes, other than just in the event of liquidation, bonds are less risky assets because their price is less volatile on the open market.Plus when held till maturity and without and default, you get what was promised to you.However, bonds also have their ratings. There are junk bonds, investment grade bonds, and the stuff in between. Higher rating, less likely to default.Equities are more volatile, and there's no maturity on a stock. You decide when to sell it. And especially in the short term, your stock price could be much lesser than how much you bought them for. 2 comments3"
2,"Question Poster22 Oct 2018Thanks for replying! Can I check how do you know how ""highly rated"" these bonds are?Hariz Arthur Maloy22 Oct 2018The rating should be highlighted in the bond Factsheets or prospectus. Go for A rating and above if you want security. But still there'll be a chance if default. Not 100%."
3,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019What your friend tells you is just a common general statement (and should be correct more than 50% of the time). Though, there are varying factors in the composition of the bonds too. Junk Bonds (those whose bonds are backed by a company that is not strong , can go bankrupt). These are like penny stocks (especially if Asset is not more than liabilities).2 comments3"
4,"Question Poster22 Oct 2018Hi, may I ask how do you determine if a company is issuing ""junk bonds""? What is the information that I should be looking out for?Loh Tat Tian22 Oct 2018You can look at a few factors:
1) The investment grade given to the bond.
2) The yield of the bond (typically can go up to 10%/annum)
3) As mentioned earlier, the valued Assets and Liabilities. In a financial statement, the bond (liability) should be fully payable by the assets in the event the company folds (so as to protect your bond). If the assets are less than the liability, that is a warning sign."
5,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 22 Oct 2018Not necessarily true. If a company fails, there is a risk that the company may not be able to repay both its shareholders and bondholders. However, it is true that bondholders are ranked higher than shareholders in a windup and bondholders may be able to get back some or all the money.0 comments2"
6,Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 27 Oct 2018Not necassarily true since not all bonds are principle guaranteed. Some blue-chip stocks can potentially provide greater earnings than bonds (where the price fluctuates).0 comments1
7,Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Not true. Bonds issued by a company that is going downhill/bankrupt VS shares of a company that is stable. Which do you think is safer?0 comments0
8,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 23 Oct 2018The term bonds covers a lot of different types of bonds... i dont know them all but hyflux had famously issued a perpetual bond which has no maturity date, which means that the issuer has the right to never return the principal amount to you. It is different from conventional bonds in many other ways as well, based on a straits times (premium) article.
So it is not accurate to give a general statement that bonds are always safer than stocks.0 comments0"
