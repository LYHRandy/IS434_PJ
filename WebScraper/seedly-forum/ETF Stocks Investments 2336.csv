1,Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Hi there! Valuation of ETFs are based on the ETF's NAV (net asset value). The ETF's NAV is the price at which shares are bought or sold from the fund company. Although it is important to note that a ETF's NAV can differ from its market price.0 comments1
