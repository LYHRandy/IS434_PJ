1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019Adding on to Woo Chun's point, closed-end funds like ETFs have a net asset value however, the trading price, which is quoted throughout the day on the stock exchange may be lower or higher than that value. The trading pruce is set by supply & demand in the marketplace. Whereas, in a open-end fund, investors make transactions based on the net asset value.0 comments0"

After which, the shares could be sold by investors who were holding those shares. Price will then be affected by supply and demand (willing buyer, willing seller). And that would mean that the price of a unit of such funds do not reflect the asset value of it bought intoExample: ETFhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closed-endinvestment.asp0 comments0"
