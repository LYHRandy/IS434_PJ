1,"Choon Yuan ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 26 Jul 2018If you are a pure beginner and the workshop offers you lessons such reading balance sheet items, cashflow projections and understanding of management vs minority shareholders and psychology of investing; such workshops are worth the thousand of dollar fee. This is because the mentioned topics are the basic tenents to active investing on your own.​However if the workshop offers by selling you their patented valuation model or secret investing formula, these are workshops I would stay away from. ​On a side note, active investing is not just about equipping yourself with knowledge but knowing your own tempearament to investing.0 comments1"

Take advice from people who have attended the course.There are many people out there who didn't attend any courses but tell you it's a scam and everything.I've attended several, and many are good and definitely worth the money.0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia GuangrongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jul 2018Personally I've gone for a few. Some are duds, but the last one I went for on investment will be powering my retirement nest egg. Its not just about the 3 days, but the continuous coaching that is (usually) offered by the trainers.Some may also offer a money back guarantee. You may wanna check if this is offered for the course you signed up for. If offered, you'll need to activate this clause either by the end of the first day or by the end of the 3 day workshop, depending on what the sales contract say0 comments0"

Think that there are several really good books and free articles online that are sufficient​Capital that you have:If you are only investing $10+k then I don't really see the point of spending thousands​Reviews and speaker's credibility:Do some research to see if the speaker is credible and if the course is useful.Also, do take into consideration the topics and which domain/ aspect of investment is being taught (stocks, bonds, properties?) ​1 comment0"
5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong26 Jul 2018Level of experience: I disagree that beginners should not get into such courses. Personally I'd think that as a beginner it may the best type of clayto be molded. Less baggage from previous experience and less to unlearn. Capital wise, why do you think it's not a good idea to start with a small amount? Important thing is to start and always possible to add later on once you gain more experience in the methodology learned "
