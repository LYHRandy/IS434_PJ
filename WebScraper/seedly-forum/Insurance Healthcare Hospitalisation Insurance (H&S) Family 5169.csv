God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi,You will want to consider a few things, amongst them, the affordability factor. For her age, integrated shield plans covering private hospitals can be quite costly. Beyond that, look for factors such as pre and post hospitalization coverage, panel listing etc. The number of factors that you may look at can be quite extensive, and it is likely better that you speak with an independent financial advisor who can explain the pros and cons of each shield plan to you before you decide.Most plans come in 2-3 types, one for private hospitals, and one for government A ward, or B1 and below. Riders are also plentiful in their types, but the main purpose of the rider is to limit your out-of-pocket expenses.You will have to fill in an application form to declare her health. At her age, it is likely that the insurer may exercise their right to call for a medical examination for her, even if she has never been admitted to hospital.0 comments1"
