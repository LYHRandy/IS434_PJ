Given that it's flexible as well I'd recommend parking your spare funds inside. The only problem is, the requirement to open the account is for 26 y.o and below.0 comments1"

Most people moving from CIMB FastSaver to this, from a 1% to a 2% p.a interest rate.0 comments1"
3,"BCBill ChanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 06 Sep 2019No catch. Do take note that the 2% p.a. interest rate can be changed at any time, the same goes for other banks. The main limitation is the age requirement which is 18-26 years old allowed to apply. When signing up, it will take 2-3 working days to process your new account. Once processed, you will receive a temporary ID to unlock your jumpstart account. It will take another few working days for your debit card to arrive via mail. Remember to activate your card and set up pin number via the Standard Chartered (SC) mobile app in order to use the available ATM network offered by SC.2 comments2"
4,"Charmaine Lim Xiaomei06 Sep 2019Hi Bill, is the age requirement only for registration or will the 2% interest be reduced after account holder hits 27?BCBill Chan06 Sep 2019To be eligible for the jumpstart account, new applicants must be 18-26 years old. You can continue to maintain the account after 27 years old. You will continue to receive prevailing interest rate which is 2% currently."
5,"JayceeLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 05 Sep 2019Oh yes, it's a good one. You've left out the 1% rebate on all spends on the debit card. I think SC is really building up its presence. Have you also heard about the eSaver that gives 2% on fresh funds, up to one million? No catch as well. It has definitely lured me away from DBS.1 comment1"
