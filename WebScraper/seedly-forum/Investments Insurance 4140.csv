question,"Investments Insurance Asked by Charmaine NgAsked on 17 Aug 2018Should I consider the AIA Triple Critical Coverage plan as a insurance cum investment with returns of 4% pa?In my bid to check out the most worthy insurance to get from AIA (and actually to better insure myself since I don't have my own term insurance) I came across this article. What do you think; is the AIA triple critical coverage a good term insurance to consider since the author idea is that you are ""investing"" at 4% returns although it's till the age of 75 before you can get back the returns for retirement purposes and at same time you are insured against critical illnesses?And if I die, the $5000 compassionate bonus could go to my funeral costs + my kins would get the sum assured?https://www.theastuteparent.com/2017/05/aviva-my-multipay-critical-illness-vs-aia-triple-critical-cover/amp/4 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019What gives you the idea that AIA Triple Critical Coverage Plan is a insurance cum investment?​To be clear, let me go through the following:1) Triple Critical Cover is a extended non-participating life plan which payouts up to 3 times the insured amount.2) However the premiums are about 2-2.5 times (depnding on it being value plan or max plan)3) If we counted the time value of money, you will lose about 33% to 45% of future value, worse if you wait until it matures4) The best time to surrender/mature for Max Plan is at age 75 (where you get back 75% of insured amount)​Based on your age, for max coverage of $800,000, the premium should be near $15,000 a year for a Max plan. That translate to about 1.87% of coverage.​You may wish to calculate whether self-insure or multi-pay CI is your cup of tea.2 comments0"
2,"Charmaine Ng24 Aug 2018Hi Low, not sure if you actually read the article link because the author is the one who made the comparison to think of MCI as an investment till age 75.Loh Tat Tian24 Aug 2018That is provided no claim is made at all on the plan. We have to factor in that as well. Whereas we also need to consider all the pros and cons of a plan.
My opinion is that, it is cheaper and better to buy a higher sum assured (with higher discount) than to get a multipay if you are worried, because the premiums are almost the same."

4,"Tan Siak Lim, CFP. Director, Financial Advisory Group at Financial AllianceLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 17 Aug 2018It's better to buy term and invest the difference. The purpose of critical illness policy is to cover loss of income, while the hospitalisation bill should be largely covered by the integrated shield plan. Therefore, for some people, it's better to cover to age 65/70, not to 100 when the premium will be very expensive.​To find out whether AIA TCC is a good plan, the way to do it is to compare with other comparable plans in the market. It always amaze me that many people don't bother to compare. Manulife, Aviva and Tokio Marine has similiar plan.

5,"Josh Tan Jian LiangLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 22 Aug 2018Hi all,​I should pick that question up by Charmaine just in case you have that same question. Parts of it seem to be out of context.​I mentioned that the AIA TCC Life is like the AIA TCC Value with a 4%p.a guaranteed return. ​That is factual IRR calculation at that circumstance.​It will not give you 4% returns on your premium and coverage along the way. C'mon.... that's too good to be true.0 comments0"
