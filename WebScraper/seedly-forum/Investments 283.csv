question,Investments Asked by NiaAsked 4d agoHas anyone tried investing with the financial advisors from the AIA Genesis group?I saw one of the FA's social media page showing screenshots of the returns of more than 15%. There is a minimum sum of around 10k but there's monthly return. It seems to be a short term investment as well. But I don't see anyone talking about this before. I'm not sure if this is one of AIA's schemes or the FA's side hustle.Has anyone invested in something similar? How's the risk? And what should one be aware of?1 answerAnswerBump0

1,"Alvin TeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 1d agoHaving being an investor for quite awhile I can safely tell you that posting 15% is on one fund returns which is hard to replicate in future. 15% is hard even for actual fund houses much less a group of financial advisors. In any case, while the product may be MAS approved, it is not right to imply returns may be 15%.There are many hooks in advertising such services and this is just one of them. I myself have a portfolio of funds in my own investment from AXA (where I was from previously) and the lousiest of them did +12% YTD, the others did more than 20% YTD. Doesn’t make it right to publish them. Neither am I doing it now, I’m merely making an example using my own portfolio as an investor.  Do speak to an actual professional, throwing my own name into the proverbial hat here as well, on such matters. How to best optimize your funds is the key and it is not just chasing gains.0 comments0"
