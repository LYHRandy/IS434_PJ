If you are not 21 years and above, you can forget about it.Otherwise, most banks require the foreigner to be working and earning a relatively high annual income before they grant the foreigner the credit card. This is to safeguard their interests, since there is a risk, no matter how small, that the foreigner can incur huge debts and just leave the country.Some banks will accept fixed deposit of a certain amount as an alternative to the income requirement but they are in the minority.There is a card that accept students though. Go google CITI Clear Card and that might help.0 comments1"
