The only aim is to profit in the shortest frame as possible via price swings/fluctuations without consideration to the company's long-term fundamentals, dividend payouts, quality of management etc.  You utilize the technical tools thats available to you & ascertain a target (buy/sell) price to enter & a subsequent target (sell/buy) price to exit the position within a set timeframe, could be days/weeks but rarely into months/years. One is making a trade order on the entire basis on how stock price behave in that single time frame. But whether technical investing is truly riskier on the practical application really depends on the individual trader, ability to stay discipline such as cutting loss when things go awry, amount of leverage used, eyes staying glued to the screen all times to be able to made a quick decision etc.However, as a individual who is ""buy & hold"" long-term fundamental investor, I do find technical analysis (albeit in much simpler forms) do have its merits when I made a decision to buy-in aftering doing my fundamental analysis. I would looked at things such as bid/ask volumes, recent price trends, price support levels to determine the appropriate price range to enter. Although quite a handful of fundamental investors out there advocate that if you are buying for the long-term, then the entry price does not matter, I tend to mildy disagree. If by allocating some time & effort to do some basic technical analysis, couipled with a dose of patience, there's a good probability one can get a stock at a better starting dividend yield & able to buy more stocks using the same amount of money. That's akin to receiving a small bonus ,free-of-charge into one's pocket.0 comments1"

MasterUpdated on 07 Apr 2019Actually it depends on alot of factors, but let's say in a general, stereotypical layman form, that technical investing is to do with quick intraday trading, and value investing is for a longer investing horizon. Then yes, Technical investing carries more risk.This is because intraday trading in itself is extremely risky. You are literally betting on price movements that may be purely running on irrational exuberance, a fancy word of saying ""everyone is FOMO and they want to jump on the easy money making wave"". To be perfectly honest, I'm not an experienced enough person to talk too much about intraday trading, but I think to have to make split second decisions on the basis of price movements and sudden news at the core, is something extremely difficult to profitably execute without a monster of a alogrithm aiding you or a team of professionals with tons of experience. Alot of intraday traders use technical analysis because they don't have to care about the company they are buying into, they just have to know if the signal says buy or sell. So, to me, that is a risky strategy that could see you winning big but losing big as well.Value trading on the other hand, is based upon buying into the true value of the business, and you won't sell it away until it hits that sweet spot which you think is the true value of the business. So, most of the time we are purchasing into a longer investing horizon, perhaps weeks, or months, before the price may reach the target. It may never reach the target at all if your estimates are wrong, but thats a different story.So yes, stereotypically, technical investing is more risky than value, because it is associated with the riskier types of investing. But if you are doing technical investing for a long term horizon with blue chip stocks, vs doing value investing with penny stocks, then no, it's not. So as you can see, there's alot of permutations as to what will increase the risk of that particular investment strategy, or what will decrease it. A strategy is just a strategy, the underlying asset, investment horizon, time, interest rates, economic conditions etc. are what determines the risk!0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 07 Apr 2019Hi David, a pleasure seeing you back here.In a nutshell, technical indicators do not look at the underlying fundamentals and financials of a business, it merely looks at the price trends of a stock to determine entry / exit price - The company may be in the red consistently for 5 years but if one applies technical analysis, there'd be a chance that one may still purchase this counter. So in terms of riskyness, based on the example cited, I think it would without a doubt carry slightly more risk than value investing0 comments0"
