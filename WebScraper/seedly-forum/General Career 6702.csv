1,"Billy OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Jun 2018As someone in the army now taking part time degree, I think you should wait till you ""settle down"" in your NS vocation first before you decide to take a part time degree or not. There are many unexpected events in NS that may affect your course of study. Application of study leave is also very subjective because you are an NSF. Best scenario is that your working hours in NS is 8-5, little or no ad-hoc events(exercise/guard duty) and having a good superior helps.0 comments1"

On the other hand, you could figure out what are the modules that you would be taking as a student...then, just start familiarising yourself with the topic...you would have close to 2 years to do so...this is like a pre-study.​As you won't have the same pressure as your peers (who are studying) you would have 2 extra years to assimilate and even, deepen your understanding of the modules...without even sitting in the classroom...it is a head-start. ​Make use of your extra time to ""pre-study"" as mentioned above AND also to understand what it takes to be an amazing RM in a bank.  ​Life is about seizing every opportunity to create your own unfair advantage. ​Hope it helpsPascal0 comments1"
3,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2018Hi! I believe it boils down to your stress threshold and how well you can cope with all the responsibilities. As a female who have never ever have to go for NS before (thank you in advance for serving the nation and protecting us!) I understand it is a very stressful period during NS and you need to really concentrate. As such I wouldn't recommend you to take up part-time degree during this period; since it is difficult for me and you to anticipate what's coming and schedules will become a big issue especially when it clashes with exercises etc.​I do however think you can start preparations early by understanding what is the syllabus covered in the programme and paying attention to relevant news in the markets while you are in the NS. This way, if you have time you are still learning and it will helps you to understand much more when your actual course starts and if you are really crashed from NS; you are not under tremendous pressure to cope with the studies as well.​Hope it helps!0 comments1"
