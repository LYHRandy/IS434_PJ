3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 26 Aug 2019Hi! You can check out the fee comparison here:https://dollarsandsense.sg/complete-cost-guide-robo-advisor-fees-singapore-investors/. Past performance is harder to quantify since there are different risk profiles to choose from and many such services are new and hence unable to qualify for the 5-year test. That being said, you can take a look at StashAway's past 2 years performance on their website.0 comments2"
