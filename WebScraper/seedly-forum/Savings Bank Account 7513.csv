1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Both are a little different. SAYE is when you credit a certain amount, let's say $500, every month for 2 years. You will be able to earn additional 2% interest which will be given on the 13th and 25th month. Also, you will not be able to withdraw any amount of money for the additional interest rate to be valid. In a way, it works like fixed deposit.DBS Multiplier gives you additional interest based on salary crediting, spending on insurance/investments. Maximum interest rate for Multiplier account is much higher if you can meet the requirements. SAYE will be good option if you weren't balloted for SSB and have no immediate use for the money or have a low risk profile since many investment vehicles can get more than 2% annually.3 comments0"
