1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Apr 2019Hello! Here's a little bit more details on the financial ratios! Price-to-earnings RatioShows how much investors are paying for $1 of earnings, thus showing if the market is overvaluing or undervalying the company. The ideal P/E ratio can be determined by comparing the current P/E ratio with the company's historical P/E, the industry average and the market P/E. Typically, a high PE indicates that the stock is overvalued or the company's earnings are expected to grow at a fast pace. Price-to-book RatioThis ratio compares the market value to its book value. A company's book value is the amount that is left if the company liquidates its assets and repays all its liabilities. If the P/B ratio is less than one, the stock is undervalued as the value of assets on the company's books is more than value the market is assigning to the company. Debt-to-equity Ratio This ratio shows the leverage of the company, in other words how much debt is used to finance the company. Typically, a lower value is better as it provides the company with opportunities for expansion due to more fund-raising options.Price/Earnings Growth Ratio The PEG ratio shows the relationship between the price of a stock, earnings per share (EPS) and the company's growth. Generally, a company that is growing fast will have a higher P/E ratio (which gives an impression that is overvalued). The PEG ratio thus gives a more accurate representation of the firm. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, it may indicate that the stock is undervalued.Operating Profit Margin This value shows the operational efficiency and pricing power. The higher the OPM, the more efficient the firm is at obtaining raw materials and converting them into finished products. The higher the margin, the better it is for investors. EV/EBITDAThis ratio is used to evaluate companies with differential levels of debt as it is capital structure-neutral. EV (Enterprise value) is the market capitalization plus debt minus cash. EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. A low ratio indicates that the company is undervalued. Return on EquityAs the name suggests, ROE measures the return shareholders get from the business and overal earnings. Investors can use this to compare the profitability of companies. A high ROE is more desirable however, it is important to note that leverage companies tend to exhibit inflated ROEs. Dividend Yield The dividend yield is the dividend per share divided by the share price. A high dividend yield signals the company is doing well, thus could be a good long-term investment as the dividends are consistent in the long run.0 comments8"

MasterAnswered on 17 Apr 2019Perhaps just to take a step back there has to be an understanding when these ratios mentioned by Sandra and Vineeta are to be used. Here are some considerations: 1) Some ratios cannot be applied to certain industries (i.e. inventory turnover rate used for products and goods but can't be used for the services industry)2) Ratios used on a single company does not show anything if it's not in comparison with its competitors, but then again, how does one exactly identify a direct competitor? Some may be in the same field but ventures into aspects not ventured by the company you are measuring of (i.e. Capitaland and City Developments, the former has malls and residential, but the latter's portfolio is majority made up of hotels, so should it be compared to other similar sized companies that comprises majority of hotels also? i.e. UOL . Hence one needs to be aware of the 'right' companies to compare these ratios with0 comments4"

4,"Khuan Yew CheahLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 18 Apr 20191) Gross margin
A high gross margin would indicate pricing power and possibly an economic moat.2) Net income margin
A high net income margin provides a buffer in case revenue drops or costs go up. A low net income margin business will easily be in the red due to small fluctuations in revenue. 3) Operating cashflow
Positive operating cashflow tells you that the business is sustainable in the long run. 4) Revenue growth
A growing business should have revenue growth otherwise it is a sign of a mature or declining business. 5) Earnings Per Share growth
Earnings per share growth should increase due to net income growth or share buybacks. That would be a sign of a healthy business.0 comments0"
