1,"Lam Kwang Yang, Financial Planner at AXA Insurance Pte LtdLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 10 Jan 2019To give our clients a peace of mind while recuperating, AXA provides 24/7 LOG. This means that regardless the time of day, someone will be working to process your case so that little or no cash is required on your side prior to hospitalisation or surgery.Adjustment of premiums are usually due to the claims history for the insurer as well as present medical costs. Being a newer provider of IP could potentially mean that claims are lower hence the lower cost. As to whether the premiums will change anytime soon, we will never know.0 comments0"

Reimbursements were done within a few weeks. It's similar to my experience with the other insurers.

You have to decide for yourself. Nobody really knows. But generally all the providers will somehow balance based on the coverage they give which is different from 1 another.1 comment0"
