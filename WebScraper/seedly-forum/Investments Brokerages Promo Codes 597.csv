Grand MasterAnswered on 02 Sep 2019They have referral code, but it's not a mass referral code to copy and paste.Need your exact email and name for Interactive Brokers to email over.Also, it's only $50 referral fees, not based on sign up, but based on trading in the accountSo the money is credited only if the other party do trade in the first few months.I have given a few to my friends, but I have not gotten any money. haha most of my friends just bought a small amount of stocks to hold.0 comments0"
