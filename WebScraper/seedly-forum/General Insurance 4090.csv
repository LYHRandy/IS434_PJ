3-5 X Annual Income for CI coverTerm or Whole Life would be up to you. For my clients we do some term, some whole life (mainly for CI). Don't count your savings plan as a protection product. It's not. It's a savings product. 0 comments0"

GeniusAnswered on 02 Oct 2018insurance is used for protection only​you should look at adequacy of coverage for the lowest cost.​whenever you mix insurance with investment, you will always be wondering why your coverage is so little. then you buy another plan and add more premiums costs.​it will never be an ending cycle.​stick with term only0 comments0"
