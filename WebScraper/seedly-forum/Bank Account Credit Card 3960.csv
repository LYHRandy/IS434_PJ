1,"Lu XinLevel 2. RookieAnswered 4w agoIt depends on your spending pattern:If you spend a bit on online shopping (Lazada, Gojek) and often uses Paywave for your daily meals etc, Live Fresh will be a better choice as those transactions will give you 5% rebate on top of the Multiplier benefits, with a monthly cap of 20+20If you spend quite a bit on grocery including Watsons or dining, then the Everyday card may give you additional benefits with higher rebates in those categories.Generally, I think it is good to start with Live Fresh as a first jobber. When your monthly spending consistently exceeds $800 (i.e. when you max out the 20+20 5% rebate limit), then you can start thinking of Everyday0 comments1"

If you spend a minimum amount of $500, you can consider the DBS live fresh. If you spend very little, can consider POSB everyday card.But do look into the different merchant discounts and promos also to see which one your family can benefit from.0 comments0"

Just get any cashback card first to get comfortable with using your card, paying back on time, enjoying the credit card points (or cashback).Once you have your first card and get used to it, slowly find the card that suits you.There is no best card, only suitable cards based on your lifestyle, dining, your usual habit of spending etc...Remember to pay your credit card debts on time! 24% on credit card debt is too hefty!0 comments0"
