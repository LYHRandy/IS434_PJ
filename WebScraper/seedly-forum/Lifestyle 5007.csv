18,"Kenichi Xi, nᴉʍ oʇ dǝnᴉʇsǝd 不能说的秘密 at Tag Team with Gabriel ThamLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Dec 2018There are people who try to convince how successful they are so they can meet up with individual and get them to trust them and pass their hard earned money to them to copy trade or ""invest"" to reach their ""successful"" level. There are people who are out there to help out those who are willing to help themselves by pointing them to the right legit resources to learn how to fish and progress from there. They don't wanna meet people or ""show off"" to gain publicity or ""trust"" so they can use other people money to make their own money. They progress everyday and hope others can see the light instead of chasing  after urban legends on inflation when Saving is the Mother of All Investment.Taking the strata malls as an example, by becoming an owner of a shop unit doesnt warrant a profit because there are malls that could not get Tenant since TOP.Always do your own homework by visiting the sites and checking out the threshold population and not let sales talk or your own beliefs make big decision that can be destructive.My meme is for one to reach a good level, one must be willing to put in hardwork and effort to ""try"" and get a ""good"" result.Everyone is trying to survive everyday even among the Best of us. By doing things with a good intention, and doing homework, even if the result is not the desired one, it will not be a painful one.0 comments4"

At every start of the year, we set our goals to achieve, and review it at the end of it. Relishing our goals may seem hard, however focusing on them is harder. The unspoken attention that it yearns slows you down. The flowers around distracts you, with its honey-coated petals. The trees calling out your name for a rest stop. The rain drowns out the sounds you should hear. The rocks eager to descend you groundwards. The sun showers you into a mental war. The bees misdirect you in a heartbeat.This is to all.Stay Focus.1 comment4"

I thought I would have continued as a Financial Advisor, but going through proper training and seeing the culture, its easier to educate by being out of it. There are also lots of ways to earn for a living, not necessarily selling products.3 comments4"
