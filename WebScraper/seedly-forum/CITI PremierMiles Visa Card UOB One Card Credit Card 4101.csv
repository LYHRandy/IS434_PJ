If it's for travelling for work like you said (and I guess business expenses are reimbursed), then no harm looking for another card to accumulate more points!0 comments2"

If your income is high enough look into the higher tier cards(income 120k and above) that offer free lounge access this will make your travel more comfortable0 comments0"
