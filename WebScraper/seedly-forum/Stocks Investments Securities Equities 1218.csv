MasterAnswered on 21 May 2019The reason for the stock price is due to a 2-for-1 stock split by the company - https://www.cnbc.com/id/48134915It is considerably a defensive stock given how it falls under consumer staples. That being said, it's Gross Profit has been decreasing over the years. Fortunately, cost control has been good with the company lowering it's expenses more than the decrease in profit, hence net income is still considerably stable.Coke's margins are to the left whereas industry average is to the right. Coke can be seen performing significantly better than its peers in the industry.
