1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Hello!Trading is usually for short term profits where people monitor the markets and buy and sell stocks to try to make money in a small time frame. Traders usually focus on a stock’s technical factors rather than a company’s long-term prospects. While for investing , it is usually in the long term and they hold stocks when the market is up and down. When investing, people usually study the prospect of the company and study whether they have confidence in the future of the company. Hope this helps!0 comments0"

You would need to learn technical analysis and charting for trading, whereas investing requires a more in-depth look into the company and its valuations.0 comments0"
