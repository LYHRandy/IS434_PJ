1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hello! Some of the available places to invest are SSB, STI ETF and Robo Advisors SSB involves the invesment in the future of Singapore by loaning the government some money. The minimum sum to start is $500. The risk level of this is rather low. STI ETF  would be recommended to those with low commitment investing and for those taking a passive way for long term investment. It involves the betting on an index fund which tracks the top 30 companies in Singapore. The minimum sum to start is $100. This carries a rather moderate risk. Robo Advisors is similar to the purchase of the STI ETF but it is for those who wish to  diversify globally. There are currently 3 players offering this service, StashAway,Autowealth and Smartly. The minimum investment can go as low as $1. This carries a moderate risk.It would be good to research more and see which type of investment that you are most comfortable in. 1 comment4"

You should do your own research about investments first and learn the basic. Dont just listen to others because everyone is different and have different goals which will have different types of investments. You need to know about the things that you are risking your money.0 comments0"
