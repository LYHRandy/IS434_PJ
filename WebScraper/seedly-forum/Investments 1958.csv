Only if you pick the right pieces.Additionally, you will be looking out not just for authenticity and craftsmenship, but also demand. Ultimately, if you are looking for watches as an investment, you would be looking for a coveted item that can command high prices from buyers later in the future.Advantages:#HIGHSESlife - but seriously though, some people do feel compelled to dress the part especially when doing business. If I wore a watch though, I would just wear one that serves its function, and not wear my investment pieces out.Family heirloom. Remember the iconic Patek Philippe slogan: 'You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.' A Patek watch does not merely tell time. It’s an heirloom that transfers values across generations.” Ah, the allure of marketing like that.Diversifying your portfolio. It is important that you conside the demand of it though. So it's important that it's piece that you will enjoy, even if the demand for it goes down.0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 25 Feb 2019I think depends on the brand and whether its limited edition type.Patek Phillipe makes a very limited quantity hence it commands very high value. If you want to purchase it, the waiting list is also extremely long. I guess this lack of supply gives it a high resale value, plus the strong branding power. People in high echelons recognize patek as a sign of real luxury. Rolex is just a marketing powerhouse.0 comments0"

Value investors seeks to buy underpriced assets based on some form of fundamental analysis. You will have to determine the value of the watch compared to the price before you decide to invest. A good investment will be one that is not only bought at a discount but also generates dividend/income/interest by holding on to them. There are 4 fundamental financial assets that give you these and they are bonds, loans, deposits and stocks.0 comments0"

The value of your watch will not be directly affected should there be a stock market crash. It would likely be a good invesment if you are able to purchase the watch below the retail price. It is also important that you know a good channel for resale where the such as if you know of any passionate watch collectors. If the watch was previously worn by a celebrity it would also be a good investment. Hope this helps!0 comments0
