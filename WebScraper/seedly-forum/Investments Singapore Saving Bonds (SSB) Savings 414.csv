God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoSSB is something that you will need to apply for at the ATM every month when new issues are announced, however, it is not mandatory. If you feel the interest rate is not good, simply sit out the tranche and wait for the next one. You can apply in multiples of 500, but redemption can take up to a month, so I do not consider it liquid. SSB is risk-free. Payouts will be to your bank every 6 months. You need a CDP account to apply for SSB.For Invest Saver, you are putting your money monthly into equity or ETF and I cannot classify that as low risk. Be aware of transaction costs eating your returns as well. Dividends paid to your bank account, but your capital will be at risk.I would advise you to take some time to gain knowledge about your options before you commence. Speak with an independent advisor to understand your options so that you can decide what works for you.1 comment3"

3,"JJefremy Level 3. WonderkidAnswered 3w agoLike I always say, if you're not retiring soon - how conservative you are equals to how deep your knowledge of money is. With time on your side, easily you can make 7 digits out of 5, really depends on how interested are you to learn.
Let's take a walk in the world or risk. Its definition is ""any uncertainty with respect to your investments to negatively affect your financial welfare"" - finra. Any instrument carries risk. How the instrument mitigates that risk, versus return, is where the value lies.
Let's take a look at dividend stocks on the STI, average payouts were 7.1%, not inclusive of capital gains. This instrument pays out regularly and provides income on top of capital gains. We compare it to SSB, 1.62% principal guaranteed AAA government-backed bond. In the case of a dividend stock, your investment is backed by the millions of dollars in a company and the 7.1% payout you get is the excess capacity of profits that shareholders get. In the case of SSB, a government is issuing debt (asking for money) to fund its activities.
Tell me, where does the value of SSB lie?0 comments0"
