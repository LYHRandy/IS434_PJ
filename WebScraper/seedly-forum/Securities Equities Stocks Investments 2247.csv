1,"Jonathan NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Mar 2019In my opinion, DBS and Capitaland Limited are 2 good Singapore stocks to buy in 2019.DBS Bank is one of the biggest lenders in Southeast Asia and is backed by Temasek, Singapore's sovereign fund manager. It is also one of the most highly digitalised banks in the region since they embarked on digital reform 2 years ago, thus we will see them reap operational efficiencies and roll out more digital initiatives. However, much talk about the inversion of the yield curve which indicates an impending recession is something we should take note before investing in this stock.Capitaland recently acquired Ascendas-Singbridge, which is owned by Temasek. This makes Capitaland one of the largest real estate and REIT company in Asia. Its huge exposure to the Chinese market, will provide much growth in the coming years. However, the Chinese slowdown is something that we should look out for.0 comments2"
