question,"Investments Lifestyle Savings Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Aug 2019Does investment in the RSP count as an investment as indicated in the DBS multiplier account? I believe investment in StashAway is not counted?I just applied for a DBS multiplier account but the thing is I am not going to use a credit card. I have a UOB One card and going to open a UOB One account(joint). Not going to credit the salary in there though. Based on the above, I'm guessing I have only 2 valid transactions?1 answerAnswerBump0"
