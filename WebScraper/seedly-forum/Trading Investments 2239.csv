1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019In essence, momentum investing attempts to take advantage of the most recent market trends, contrarian investing takes the opposite approach. Contrarians go against prevailing market trends by selling when others are buying, vice versa. Mr Warren Buffet himself espouses these contrarian values, famously urging investors to ""be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful"". Contrarian trading is built on the idea that investors overreact to news developments and overvalue ""hot"" stocks while undervaluing distressed stocks. Contrarian investors often target undervalued stocks and then sell them once the share price has recovered, hoping to profit from that.On the other hand, momentum traders buy and sell according to the strength of recent price trends, usually utiliising technical indicators as a basis to buy/sell to profit off of high-volume stocks movements. Basically, momentum traders believe that an asset price that is moving strongly in a given direction will continue to move in that direction until the trend loses strength.0 comments0"
