Unless of course it blows up to a large scale conflict- of which then you could even say it might be good for companies globally dealing with weapons & arms manufacture.In fact, brexit complications which threaten EU's region stability are currently being underplayed by larger positive market movements in US and China. Therefore unless you are an investor exposed particularly to Indian markets/currency, impact on general markets, even SGX, should be quite minimal.0 comments0"
