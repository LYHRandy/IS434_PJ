question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Nov 2018I am thinking of downgrading Enhanced Incomeshield with assist rider from Private hosp to B1 ward. Is this advisable?I am currently 31. Current price keep increasing esp for private hospitals and will be unsustainable at old age. I am fine with B1 wards in future so I feel in fact I am over-insuring. There does not seem much to lose but lots to gain with this downgrade or ""right sizing"".2 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The main difference would be quality of care and waiting time to receive said care.In an emergency, you would be sent to the nearest hospital. If it so happens to be a private hospital, you would have to pay for that care until you can transfer out. If you're scheduling for a surgery or treatment, private hospitals would be quite fast, Govt hospitals you would have to wait.In the end it's up to you to weigh this up against cost, but I would personally not go below A ward. I want the privacy for myself and my family.1 comment2"

3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Nov 2018You can consider downgrading in future, if cashflow proves to be an issue. But definitely I do not advise to do that for the forseeable future. Anyway your premium for assist rider is very affordable, and premium for preferred plan can be fully paid with your medisave.That being said,there is significant difference in time savings and comfort by going to the private route. Not just waiting time for your turn, time is also saved from area of making medical decision. The way restructure hospital works will cause slower medical decision (conclusion) most of the time. In addition, most of the experienced (skilled) specialists are in the private practice. When u become really sick, your concern (and your love ones) will only want to seek the best medical care for u. That few hundred more that u pay each year will become really insignificant then. Do add me on facebook if u need more advice. 0 comments0"
