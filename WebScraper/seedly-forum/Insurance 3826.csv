question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 May 2019If i SUSPECT that i have a spinal injury, maybe a possibility of a slipped disc, what kind of insurance policy would be recommended to get before i go for any scans such as MRI/X-Rays?Because from what i know, i believe that there will be many exclusions if i were to be diagnosed with a spinal injury. Possibly a policy that will cover me for that spinal injury and subsequent problems that might arise indirectly or directly related to the spinal injury. And also best if it can cover all the treatment costs that is needed to treat the injury (this costs might go on for years before I can fully recover from it), that's my concern.3 answersAnswerBump1"

God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It may be a little too late to purchase insurance now and get standard terms. You will need to declare your suspicion and go for a medical test to confirm.Only policies that cover pre existing would be available, and usually they're either more expensive or only accessible via group insurance.2 comments3"
2,"Question Poster06 May 2019Ok let me rephrase my question, I don't have any pre-existing condition or pain, what kind of policies can I get to cover me for any spinal injuries? And also policies that will cover subsequent treatments for any spinal injuries.Hariz Arthur Maloy07 May 2019Alright. Disability income, total permanent disability cover, CI cover, a personal accident plan, and of course hospitalization plan."
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Unfortunately, your injury will be considered as a pre-existing condition as you have not applied for the insurance coverage yet. If you deny the information during the insurance application, it may bite back at you when you submit claims later. Consequences may be denial of claims and voiding of policy.2 comments2"
4,"Question Poster06 May 2019I only suspect.. i just want to protect myself in case its really a spinal injury. i don't have like ongoing pain or whatsoever. just feel like my back is abit tense, could be just normal muscle tightness, but i just want to be sure because i always think of worst case scenario, hence i just want to be prepared just in case.Jonathan Chia Guangrong06 May 2019Perhaps you should go get it checked before you apply for coverage. If all is well, look to apply for hospitalisation, PA, and TPD. And disability income if you can afford it. Hope all is well for you"
