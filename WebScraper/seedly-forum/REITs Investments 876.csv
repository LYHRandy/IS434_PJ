MasterAnswered on 04 Jul 2019First of, congrats to us (I have some as well) because Ascott REIT is going to acquire all of AHT's shares at $1.08 and since IPO till date, AHT has never reached that price, hence its definitely beneficial to AHT's unitholders.
They will do this via provision of shares from Ascott REIT-Business Trust (the combined entity following the M&A) and cash as mentioned by Darren :)However, this is with the assumption that Ascott REIT's price is at $1.30. Therefore, if Ascott REIT's price begins to decline, then the worth of AHT holdings would be less than $1.08. Therefore, a lot is dependent on how Ascott REIT performs0 comments0"
