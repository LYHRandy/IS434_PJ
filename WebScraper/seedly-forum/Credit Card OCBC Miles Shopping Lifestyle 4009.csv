question,"Credit Card OCBC Miles Shopping Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 25 Aug 2019How does the new OCBC 90°N credit card foreign fees work?Hi there, I am considering to get the OCBC 90°N card for miles, saw that foreign charges are 3%?My calculation of value for the miles:(E.g. Payment in JB for RM300, estimated SGD100)Foreign charge = SGD100 x 3% = SGD3.Miles earned = SGD100 x 4mpd = 400 miles.Max cost of mile im willing to spend = SGD0.018.Cost per mile from transaction = SGD3 / 400 = SD0.0075.Thus is worth it if im willing to pay up to SGD0.018 per mile.Would appreciate if anyone could confirm my understanding :)1 answerAnswerBump0"

The 90°N allows you to buy a mile at 0.75 cents. In this case, it is less than your limit so, why not?You can refer to the articles below for reference:1)  https://milelion.com/2019/08/28/2019-edition-best-cards-for-overseas-spending/ 2)  https://mainlymiles.com/2019/08/26/credit-card-review-ocbc-90n-mastercard/  (go straight to the comments. much better explanation)0 comments0"
