question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 Apr 2019How long would you stay in your current company and decide it is time to move on?To put into context, it wasn't easy to get into this company in the first place because of its stringent processes and branding. There is a good mix of employee who has been here for 20-30 years; while the younger generations do move on to another company after a few years. The overall employees' benefits are good but career progression seems rather slow. I know of someone whom took 10 years to promote from an executive to manager but maybe it's just how such big organization works.2 answersAnswerBump0"
