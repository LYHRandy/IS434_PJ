WizardAnswered on 25 May 2019It really depends on your situation.If you are an expat and not looking to stay in the same place (or country) for the long haul, renting would give you a lot more flexibility.However if you are looking for a place to stay and plan to be in Singapore for the long haul, you may find that buying a property and paying off the mortgage could make more sense than renting (maintenance and miscellaneous expenses included).0 comments1"

Both of them have their own benefits. Renting property seems to be a lighter financial commitment while buying property is a huge financial commitment for any person. With rented property, one has the flexibility to move aywhere, anyime. This is very handy in situations where one feels like changing your location for any reason. Buying a property has a lot of benefits in the long run. The major benefit is related to income generation. Purchasing property can generate good amount of income in the future. Also, you can customize your purchased property anyway you want. You can add or remove anything you want to. This is not possible with rented property. Also, purchased property can easily be inherited.0 comments1"
