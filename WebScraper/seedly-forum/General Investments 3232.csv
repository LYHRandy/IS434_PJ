And what was your plan initially?If you put money in with intention to trade short term, then you have to ask yourself are you still hoping or do you have a plan?If you put money in and your analysis say this is undervalued, then does it follow your long term plan? What is your plan initially? If you did not have one before buying the stock, then it is same as gambling. 0 comments0"
