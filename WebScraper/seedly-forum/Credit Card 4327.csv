question,"Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Aug 2018What is a good way to deal with funds for someone heading to the states to study?Hello, i will be heading over to the U.S. from singapore for my studies. i am just wondering which would make more sense - do a TT over from singapore to a US bank (when i am there) or should i just pay for big ticket expenses (such as school fees) using my SG Credit card (and just suffer on exchange rate) and earn miles? Which is the best way? thanks!2 answersAnswerBump0"
