1,"KevinLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 17 Sep 2019Like everyone said, the rounding up is not much of a big deal as the difference is relatively small.However, the bigger concern here is, the fact that we are all willing to provide a copy of a confidential document such as a payslip.
Sharing payslips to hiring teams has been a widespread practice, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. You may politely refuse due to code of conduct and confidentiality concerns. You may even challenge the hiring team if they normally allow their employees sharing their payslip (am almost certain they would not want either). So rather than payslip, provide other means of proof like tax computation or salary credit bank statement. The hiring manager may even add integrity points to you for doing that  :)3 comments4"
2,"See all 3 comments Huang Yixuan11 Sep 2019I totally agreeEAEugene Ang17 Sep 2019Correct me if I'm wrong, a tax computation has even more personal info you might not want to reveal such as your deductibles and other sources of income. Honestly a credit bank statement is no different from the payslip."
3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 05 Sep 2019Don't think this is a big deal. It's not like she said 3k but she actually makes 2.7k.It's literally rounded up to the nearest hundred. Don't need to worry, just submit and be confident.1 comment3"

5,"YMYeap Ming Feng, Head of Content & SEO at SeedlyLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 06 Sep 2019From my experience, it is perfectly ok. Most people bump up their current draw during job interviews. It is a very common practice and the company that accepted her would have taken that into account.0 comments2"
6,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 08 Sep 2019While it is not good to lie IMHO, $2,940 and $3,000 is such a small difference, that HR probably would give her the benefit of the doubt that she was just rounding up.Of course, if she said $3,000, and her payslips show $2,000 - then I think there would be a problem.
Just ask her to relax and prep up for the new job!0 comments1"
7,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Sep 2019Though lying is not encouraged, most people will treat her case as rounding up only, which is rather common, esp since the gap isn’t that big a difference. I’m sure she’ll be fine and good luck with her new job!0 comments0"
8,"Angeline TeoLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 15 Sep 2019$2940 and $3000 is only $60.Most employers are able to understand this small difference due to rounding-up.For a second, I thought ""your friend"" exaggerated in hundreds. Meh. $60 is fine.Rest assured that the employer is most keen about her abilities and skillset, not so much about her last pay.This aside, what else can she do besides providing the payslip? Not much choice she has, right? So go ahead and provide the payslip. Don't have to make excuses or apologises, its just a small round-up.Enjoy the new job!0 comments0"

11,"LMLing MaiLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 11 Sep 2019Employers have no right to compel you to share personal information! What if you ask them to show you their hiring data, turn over rate, or internal company financials before joining them?
Typical power imbalance when hiring. Know your rights. All the best!0 comments0"
12,"EveLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 10 Sep 2019As a HR, I would say not an issue as I would just assume it's simply rounding up on her part. It's not a big diff hence tell ur fren to chill.0 comments0"
13,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Sep 2019It's just rounding up, so it's fine. Furthermore, the reason for asking for past payslip is also as evidence, they will then calculate the given / new pay with this evidence to come out with the final amount.
So it's safe. No worries.0 comments0"
14,"Jay Teo Jia XuanLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 10 Sep 2019Don't worry about it, it’s fine with the slight difference in the salary. To make your Friend feel a little better, when he/she reply with the payslips, drop a note to apologise on the slight disparity. Honesty is the best policy
Hope it helps0 comments0"
15,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Sep 2019I wouldn't think it's an issue, rounding up sounds about right and what most people will do. To collect payslip is just a documentation process on the audit. Why? Because if that person is drawing 3k now and you offered say 5k, you need to justify the increase as that didn't align with the industry norm. Don't worry and just submit. If questioned then just answer.0 comments0"

17,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Sep 2019I thought she say $3k and only earn $1.5K.To be honest, it is an open secret that everyone knows that salary is inflated during interviews.Anything less than $100 is fine in my opinion. You could always say that you take the bonus and average it out for the year, hence the increase.0 comments0"
18,"Fergus TanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Sep 2019$3k and $2940 is not much of an issue.
I typically expect most people to round to the nearest hundreds anyway.0 comments0"
