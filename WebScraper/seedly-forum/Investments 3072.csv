1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019They are managed by different companies, and they have different structures, and thus different cost structure. The 2 best ones are ishares (IVV) and Vanguard's (VOO). Their expense ratio at extremely low at about 4basis points. Their performance difference at only about 0.01-0.02% which is fairly neligible. Any broker that can buy shares in the US will be able to buy these ETFs. A broker that offers low commission should be your choice. 2 comments0"
2,Joel Pang14 Mar 2019Thanks for the share Yixiong! Just wondering how do you purchase the Vanguard or ishares locally? Through Poems?Yixiong Chang14 Mar 2019Maybe look at Saxo capital? Their min commission rates are much lower than peoms or other local players. Saxo has a local office here and is regulated by MAS.
