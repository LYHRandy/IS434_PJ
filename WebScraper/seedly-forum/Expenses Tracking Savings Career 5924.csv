God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Nov 2018The others have stated to track your expense and cut down on your spending. But honestly, there's only so much one can do. We still have a life to live.I'll focus on making more money. 1.9k is not enough. Take on side gigs, learn a marketable skill and get paid for it, start a side hustle. It's easier to make an extra $500 per month than it is to cut $1k expenses to only $500.So go out there and make some moolah babe.0 comments1"

Open a CIMB Fastsaver account here. https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/en/personal/products/accounts/savings-accounts/cimb-fastsaver-account.htmlCreate a monthly recurring standing instruction in your current bank account that your salary is credited into, and transfer $300 into the CIMB FastSaver account every month. It gives your 1% interest rate without any condition. No fall below fees. If you like, quote my name as the referral. This method will force you to save. I am using it since one year ago.0 comments1"

WonderkidUpdated on 08 Nov 2018If you need a financial walk through example, find Dave Ramsey's financial life steps simple and easy to follow: https://www.youtube.com/user/DaveRamseyShowI don't personally agree much on his side of investment or credit, but his steps encourages someone who are new or have never save, to start financial planning. Basically, Dave Ramsey lists what his 7 Baby Steps to financial freedom are:Baby Step 1 – $1,000 to start an Emergency Fund ~
I believe most Singaporeans would have POSB account as a child. Set up a SAYE and/or eMySavings Account with standing order to transfer minimum $50 monthly. This can be easily done in the POSB digiapp. Don't have a card link to these account and ignore it. This will force you to spend around your main bank account. Increase the transfer once you are more confident. Baby Step 2 – Pay off all debt using the Debt Snowball ~
List your debts from smallest to largest. Make minimum payments on all your debts except the smallest. Pay as much as possible on your smallest debt. Repeat until each debt is paid in full.Baby Step 3 – 3 to 6 months of expenses in savings ~
Look to increase your money. Increase your standing order to the savings account. Look at expenses that you can cut. Baby Step 4 – Invest 15% of household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement ~
Set aside for retirement. Put into the Sg equivalent -SA and SRS Account. Baby Step 5 – College funding for childrenBaby Step 6 – Pay off home earlyBaby Step 7 – Build wealth and give! - 
5-7 could be looked into concurrently. Learn the basics of investing. Diversify it, don't put all in one basket. Do enough research before committing to an investment. 0 comments0"

I think this is a very real concern and good that you are thinking ahead :) that's truly the first step won, so you should pat yourself on the back for that.Next, I think you should actually map all these expenses and income out on a simple excel sheet. It should look something like this:SalaryTake homeFixed expensesVariable expensesSavings From the above, you will be able to see how much each category is taking up. Thereafter, you can start adjusting the individual amounts for each category. For tracking of your variable expenses, you can use an app like ours (seedly) or any other expense tracking app to track your outflow to make sure that you don't overspend on certain categories :)Most importantly, what I personally do (and encourage every one in my team) as well to do, is that set up Standing Instructions (SI) to each accounts for savings and spending.And do not touch your savings account. So this becomes a rule based way to grow your money over time quickly and easily.You can read more about this which I have detailed here: https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-allocate-your-monthly-salary/0 comments0"
