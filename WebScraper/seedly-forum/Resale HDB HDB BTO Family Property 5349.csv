question,"Resale HDB HDB BTO Family Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 25 Oct 2018I’ve got a few questions about BTO and Resale SBF. Am a first-timer here with near parents scheme, looking at mature estate. What may cause me to forfeit my chance?I got a queue number that is within the number of units but never turn up at HDB HUB. Or I got a terrible queue number, turn up at HDB then found out suay suay left 1 unit for you or left low levels unit which you don’t want. U tell the person u don’t want them. BTO or SBF at mature estate with near parents scheme. Which has a higher chance? Or both is just a game of luck? Anyone applied for both SBF and BTO of the same month exercise before?2 answersAnswerBump0"

ProdigyAnswered on 26 Oct 2018Off topic.But I do find it weird that there is Facebook discussion and seedly Q&A.Probably the question is asked on seedly directly this some admins re post it here to drive traffic.I just feel weird for this behavior in modern apps.Anyhow. No advice but 1 note on the near parents scheme.To be eligible, parents have to sign contract with hdb to stay there for 5 years.Some situation where this may be negative.You intend to bring your parents over and rent out their unit fully or sell it.Your parents intend to move away.0 comments1"

It may come back to haunt you in future flat exercise with HDB. You may want to reconsider your choice depending on your timeline and budget to go for a resale, as that would give you better control and choice in the selection of your place of living. 0 comments0"
