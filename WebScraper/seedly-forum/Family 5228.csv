WizardAnswered on 23 Jul 2019I pay directly for household groceries/consumables like toilet paper (goes very fast in the house), tissue paper, toothpaste, shampoo, body soap etc. And when it comes to big ticket items that need to be replaced eg. washing machine, curtains for the whole house, mattresses and bedsheets for everyone, I cover that too.0 comments2"

It would be weird for them to understand why they receive a different amount per month if you go by percentage. Actually, I recommend you should do that regardless of being self employed or not.Your parents love you, but its still going to be weird for them if you give them less over time. So set the bar low and work your way up to giving them more as you become mroe successful. You are as successful as you are ideally because of them, after all.0 comments1"
