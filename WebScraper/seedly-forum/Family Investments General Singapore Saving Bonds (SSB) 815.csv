question,"Family Investments General Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) Asked by MujimoroAsked on 25 Jun 2019To fellow parents: what do you do with cash gifts (red packets, etc) for your children? Do you invest it for their future?I was considering, for example, SSB investment in blocks of $500 or putting it in a high interest rate account..Personally I would not be comfortable to invest it in high risk products as it is technically a gift to them and I wouldnâ€™t want to lose any of it :pThoughts?1 answerAnswerBump2"
