Take too many loan will create a bigger problem. ​When market crash, all of them will margin call you same time and you need to top up with cash to sustain your investment. If you cannot provide the cash, all will force sell even at loss. 0 comments1"

5,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Sep 2018It is not advisable to borrow money from multiple companies to invest.  It is more prudent to save up to invest. In the current economic climate where interest rates are rising, one would end up paying higher interests for borrowing money. 0 comments0"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Sep 2018Firstly, how sure are you that your investment will make money? If you are dealing with stocks, you will need to be correct 100% of the time to make money. May not always be possible. Unless you know a way to make money even when you are wrong in your investments (which is possible if you know how. I do it very often). That said, secondly, it's not wise to borrow money to pump into investments. Thirdly, borrowing from too many banks at the same time may drastically affect your credit score and affect your ability to borrow in future. Not a good thing. If you are going to borrow from credit agencies aka legalised loan sharks that's even worse. Their rates are far worse as compared to loans from banks.. Best to think hard before you start borrowing to put into any investment.. Do let us know if you need further help, and all the best 0 comments0"
8,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Sep 2018I do not think that you should get a loan to invest. In fact, one should always try their best to clear off their loans before starting to invest. If your investment fails, then you'll be having a hard time coping.0 comments0"
9,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Sep 2018I don't think it's wise to take up a loan to start investing. All investments carry risks and you should only invest with money that you can afford to lose and before you invest, you should have some spare savings set aside first. If you take up a loan to invest and the investment doesn't reap profits, you'll be busy trying to pay off the debt instead of earning additional funds0 comments0"
