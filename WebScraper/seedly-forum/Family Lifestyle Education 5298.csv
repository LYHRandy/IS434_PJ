1,"Thaddeus TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Feb 2019Like @stephyeo said there is really no model answer to your question. I feel that getting some form of work-experience at a young age is beneficial. One can learn and gain alot from it. I did a few part time jobs after my major exams in secondary school and JC as I felt that I had more time after my exams. IF your concern is so that she is not distracted from her studies, she could probably wait till her exams has ended and work part-time during the holiday period.0 comments0"

I think you’re the best judge to tell when your daughter is ready to juggle both work and studies. Maybe get her to start doing some simple stuff during school holidays first.0 comments0"

Train them to learn and do the housework and  pay them by the hour part time rate $6.50 so that they will realize  that $ is hard to earn. Teach them the values of savings and wonders of compund interest by opening suitable savings accounts for them. Once they reach the age of 16, school holiday can do some simple part time job that is safe and simple wtihout complex people or too much strangers to be safe.The moment they reach Poly / Uni, ask them to give tution to preschoolers teaching simple English, Mandarin or even Maths to earn their pocket $. 0 comments0"
