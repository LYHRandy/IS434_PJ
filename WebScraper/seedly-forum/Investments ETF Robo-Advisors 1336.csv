1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 13 May 2019Most robo advisors will have ETFs in their portfolio hence you won’t need to top it up yourself.Great to see you have some guidelines for yourself already! A few more areas, to help you decide how you should allocate your 2k will be.
1. What’s your desired outcome from your portfolio (Annual IRR %?)
2. Investment time horizon. This will help you to better decide how you want to allocate your money.
As you have no time to manage your own portfolio now, a Robo-advisor is fine or you can find a professional to have a portfolio set up and keep you updated regularly.You can even split up the funds between robot and human. Ultimately, your portfolio strategy should be aligned with your desired outcome and risk profile.You can check out robo advisor comparison here

2,"Samuel Rhee, Chief Investment Officer at EndowusLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 22 May 2019Please visit http://www.endowus.com and see the difference we offer. We are more sophisticated than the simple roboadvisors because we have used our wealth of experience managing client assets to find the best solutions for you. We are wholly digital and completely independent in our advice and offering. We offer sophsticated investment advice, access to better institutional quality products/funds, and at the lowest cost possibel (a fraction of the industry average). We have brought to you the most suitable funds for Singapore based investors :  SGD-denominated(do not need to take FX risk like with Robos), Tax-efficient(We use low cost Irish UCITS funds vs US ETFs for Robos who get taxed 30% on US witholding tax if you are Singapore resident that's almost 1% additional costs). ETFs listed in the US have tax and FX issues, Irish UCITS ETFs have lower tax and less FX issues, but cost more in fees as they have less scale and also have wide bid-ask spreads which also increases cost of going in and out. ETFs are basically funds that are listed in an exchange. The point is to have ETFs listed in your local market so its in your home currency but also because you have intra-day liquidity. But since Singapore does not have any global and diversified ETFs listed in SGX, there is no efficient way to invest in ETFs in Singapore. Therefore the most cost efficient passive product vehicles to invest in are the ones we have chosen at Endowus.

First of all, different strategy for different age profile clients. Once you have already set aside your emergency funds, the rest of your funds can be made to work harder for you. I would divide it into 3 portions Funds to be used for different life phase. Are you intending to buy a house? Are you intending to start a family? Build up a passive income by diversifying into different portfolio. Robo advisors is one of the way to start. But you might not want to be only exposed to them. You can diversify into funds, reits, stocks etc. So that you can gauge their performance and build up your portfolio as the year goes. If you would like to find out more, of course I would be happy to dive deeper. Just feel free to message me back.0 comments1"

You can either do lump sum or dollar cost average. Either way, as long as you are consistently investing over the long term, you will do fine. Just deposit and let it do its thing.And if you are using robos, most of them already invest in ETFs, so you might not want to buy your own ETFs monthly.0 comments1"
