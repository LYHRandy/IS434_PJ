1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Most people have minimal knowledge on it too! Don’t worry! ☺️For starters, I hope you have your insurance set up and emergency fund growing. Don’t go into investments without doing those first.With your first Job and having little investment knowledge. Focus on building up your knowledge, invest in yourself by going for courses and reading up books. You can set aside 5 to 20% of your income for self-education. Speak to professionals like myself that are in such practice. Hear from them and understand the differences in the 6 major asset classesThere are some great websites out there to read too, do visit them. 
Tap on those areas and you will grow! Good luck0 comments3"

God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Start by saving 6 months of your income for an emergency expense that you do not touch.Invest everything else you don't need within 3 years.Invest globally, invest for the long term, and diversify across and within asset classes.Easiest way would be to set up a globally diversified portfolio with asset allocation aligned with your requirement, willingness, and ability to take risk, through a traditional or digital financial advisor. Seedly has tons of great articles on getting started, but do seek advice from professionals should you need closer guidance. :) Good luck!0 comments3"

Even if I don’t answer prob the admins will gave you this linkYour Complete Guide To Winning Your Personal Finance In 2019 (Guide Included) https://blog.seedly.sg/beginner-series-tips-seedly-money-framewor?utm_source=app&utm_medium=shareIn summary, you should try to follow the sequence,
1. Learn about your spending habits by recording all you spendings and creating a Budget. Adjust target accordingly.
2. Save enough for Emergency savings. 
3. Get insured.These first 3 items should be more than enough to occupy you for 3-6 months into your first job. If you have time, can do some reading on investments. But I really don’t suggest putting too much on your plate while you are trying to develop a new habit. “Simple” is the key to keeping to a good habit.After putting aside your em funds and purchase your insurance, then you start to invest. Most of the guys in the blog will suggest you start with sti eft, if you want to invest while you are still “blur”. For someone with insufficient funds (I assume) can use regular saver, so it’s less strain on your month budget. There is also quite a few robo Advisors that are now in the market. Do note that these options are recommended for mid-Long term investments.I’m really not the best person to answer questions on investments, so I shall await the answer of the Shi fus.0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2019Yes,you can read the various seedly articles which are interesting and insighting also,you may want to...1.Create your monthly budgetYou are most likely going to spend more then necessary if you do have a pre-planned monthly budget. Keep a clear record of your earning and spending habits, and plan a budget accordingly.In my case, I do not have a pre-planned budget but I have a fixed amount of cash in my wallet that I put at the start of the week allowing me to keep track of my expenses easily.There is no doubt that credit and debit offer you an easy way to make payment. However, using cash will help prevent spending more as you will budget accordingly. You will also be protecting yourself from potential credit card theft and other fraudulent activities.2. Get a piggy bankIt may seem childish, but starting a piggy bank is a great habit that will enable you to add to your savings. You can either fix an amount to put in your piggy bank daily or simply empty your pockets into it at the end of each day. In my case, I empty my coins out into the piggy during the weekend.You can also opt for an auto transfer from your main bank account to your sub-account(money cannot be seen are money that cannot spend)if you would like too invest,do visit my blog:  https://sonicericsg.blogspot.com/2018/12/post-72week-48tipforthought10-financial.html i am currently creating a series of post on my learning investing journey0 comments0"
