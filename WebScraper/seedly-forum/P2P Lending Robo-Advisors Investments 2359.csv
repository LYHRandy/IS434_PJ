Just need to manage your risk and beginner will be fine too. 1) P2P - High risk but higher return in shorter terms. I invest in Funding Society 2 years ago , no loan default and returns goodMy review :https://seedly.sg/reviews/p2p-lending/funding-societies?rid=12#reviews&utm_source=review_share&utm_medium=internalPlease like if you think it's good.  P/S: Just need to choose the right platform carefully. Read the review at the above links and also read this summary by Seedly:  https://blog.seedly.sg/p2p-comparison/2) Robo advisor : Long term (10 years to see good results ) investment. Basically a modernize unit trust with much lower fee manage by AI / algorithm. It invest in a basket of Bonds, gold, index funds, S&P 500 index funds , REITs, ETF and fix cash etc. Due to the risk spread out and I'm with StashAway for the last 2 years, no win no lose as it's still early to know. Do watch out for the recurring management fees.My review at : https://seedly.sg/reviews/robo-advisors/stashaway?rid=479#reviews&utm_source=review_share&utm_medium=internalPlease like if you find it good.

2,"Pluto MaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 09 Mar 2019I did both as a beginner and i would advise you to allocate and diversify carefully.P2P is short term. I allocated a small amount and am prepared to lose all my capital. For my robo-advisor, I set a longer time frame of 10 years with reasonable risk setting while evaluting yearly whether to increase/decrease the risk and amount.It is worth noting that P2P definietly has much higher returns even than my equities (but then I am not that good at investing) but the risk is also much higher and i would caution you to think twice on the amount you allocate.0 comments0"
3,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Mar 2019Hello!As a beginner investor I personally think that investing in either one would be a bit risky. I think it would be best to understand both of these investments first before deciding whether you want to invest in it. Maybe you can try other safer forms of investment firms such as the SSB and doing Dollar cost averaging.hope this helps!0 comments0
4,"Terence Tan, Finance at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 07 Mar 2019Why will you want to do that? They are both different risk type investment.For beginners, I always tell them. If you want to do it right, just learn investment first. Take $3k to $5k and try investing. See if you will be able to endure the roller coaster ride.Do note money invested has to be disposal income.0 comments0"
