1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Oct 2018I'm the same as Luke. I do some of both, mainly because doing from scratch requires a lot of time. I'll look at the numbers done up by others and do my own analysis and decisions from there!0 comments1"
2,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It's actually a combination of both and it depends on the need as well as individual people's time.Successful investing is actually 90% asset allocation (the rest being management, fees, skill etc). Not to be confused with trading, where you get the best forex and options traders (looking at you Jon) putting up some ballistic annualized returns, so its hard to tell when you ask 'serious' investors what they do specifically. I have a pretty decent record for investing, but my timing was certainly fortunate (the bulk of my investing was done at the end of 2016 and onwards), so you have to determine who your role models are in this field before you consider their analyses as part of your 'portfolio' in the future. 2 comments1"
3,"Yong Kah Hwee28 Oct 2018I'm the opposite; the bulk of my investment was done at the end of last year and throughout this year. Seeing so much red now causes me some anxiety :(Luke Ho28 Oct 2018I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm sure it doesn't reflect on your own skill and hard work as an investor, so not to worry. "
