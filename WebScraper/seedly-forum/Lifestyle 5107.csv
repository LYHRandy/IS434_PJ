question,Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Oct 2018What’s a networth of a typical NSF?My networth is 2K and I abosulutely have no idea how some NSFs can have more than 20K. Not being jealous but curious on how they could reach such an amount for a young age. I’m guessing it’s through part time work in the past. Unless they know something I don’t.2 answersAnswerBump0

1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Haha I think 2K networth is not bad already tbh. haha. If I were, you I would focus on learning things inside the NS. Learn excel skills, planning, how to work with people in organisational structures and stuff that your female peers cannot learn inside.I think you friend with the 20K is smoking you. And don't be drawn into it. It could be some money their parents has passed to them to hold on to or manage. True story, I have a friend like this also. Last time, when I was an officer, I earned around 1.2k per month? but also weekend and canteen breaks, i didn't have alot to save also. I think all in all around 5k saved only? after 1 year 10 months in service.But again, don't worry, I would focus on the softer skillsets, so when you ORD, you'll be mentally better to approach job interviews, etc, which would mean increasing your income. Trust me! I've been through that and I'm on the other side now. Happy to answer your questions if you have any bro :)2 comments2"
2,"Serene Toh30 Oct 2018Networth also includes any insurance policy their parents may have purchased for them from birth. Plus Ang Pow money collected if they have a lot of generous relatives and don't spend any of the money from young. If you consider all this from birth, maybe not so hard to understand.Kenneth Lou30 Oct 2018That's a fair point! @Serene Haha. Ang pow money is a big one. For me I don't really include the insurance policies haha... cos the cash values also not high (personally)"

You can refer to this: https://blog.seedly.sg/national-service-ns-how-much-can-one-save/. If you manage to enrol into OCS, 20k during the 2 years (approx.) should be possible.2 comments0"
