2,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Nov 2018I think the better question is WHY? The STI ETF isn't a particularly strong instrument to trade in your guaranteed interest rates for (stated below by Yang Teng).https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/sti-etf-not-good-beginnersI have helped clients use any excess of their CPF OA to invest in high risk funds to compound all the way till 55 or even 65 ...9% annualized net of fees looks much better than 2.5%. If you're interested, you can always drop me a PM.  It's not like you can touch the money till then, and there isn't the 35% restriction. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"

CPF interest rates is guaranteed at(01 October 2018 to 31 December 2018)Ordinary Account: Up to 3.50% p.aSpecial & MediSave Accounts: Up to 5.00% p.a.which is hard to beat with ETFs. If you are still keen, you can refer to their website for more details: https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/optimising-my-cpf/cpf-investment-schemes.0 comments0"
