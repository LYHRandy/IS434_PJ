With BCIP, you will be selecting the stocks yourself.Robo-advisors may also have algorithmns to rebalance, reallocate the ETFs based on different factors. BCIP is a straightforward structure, what you put in is what you have on hand, whether up or down market, your portfolio doesn't automatically rebalance.The fees also vary across BCIP, and the different robo advisors.0 comments0"
