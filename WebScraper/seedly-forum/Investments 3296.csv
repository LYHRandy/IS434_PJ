MasterAnswered on 03 Oct 2018My take, if you really want capital growth and dividend income, research on 2 classes of stocks called dividend aristocrats and kings. These stocks have a track history of paying out and increasing their dividend amounts for 25 years or more. Not available in our local markets though. 0 comments0"
