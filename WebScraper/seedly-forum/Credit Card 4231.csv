question,"Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 10 Jan 2019I have some big ticket items coming up (proposal, wedding, renovation, furniture, travel). Am thinking of getting a miles credit card just for the above. Which miles card should I get?Am currently using the cashback UOB ONE card for day-to-day items; but since the cashback has a maximum limit; I think I should use a miles credit card for my big ticket items. Is that a good idea? Am hoping to make full use of the current Singsaver ""Air Miles vs Cash Back"" promotion =) Thank you!2 answersAnswerBump0"
