1,"Fergus TanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Sep 20193k debts is not a big amount.Is your passion in financial sales, or just looking at numbers?
To be honest, it's hard to advise because there really isn't much details on your current work, or skillset, or whatnot.Besides insurance sales, you can consider looking at other types of sales if you want to clear your debts quickly.
Insurance or financial advisory is hard. Most people will reject you even before trying to understand you who are. In other industry, you might still be able to get the first meeting before your presentation skills are put to the test.My suggestion is to go check out the people who are hiring in the insurance and financial advisory space. Talk to them, ask them how they will help you, and try to find people who have gotten success recently, and if you feel you can model after them.
It will be hard work. Good luck!!0 comments1"

The key is to stop that mindset of taking ‘shortcut’. Be realistic and do within your limits. Now you have the goal of getting BTO in 3 years time, you should start looking at your financial planning and start having other achievable goals e.g. every month save $xxx for mortgage and $xxx for renovation, cut down on other expenses etc. Sales job will generate high income IF you are hardworking, got that wit and discernment to make it high up there. Nonetheless, it all still takes time, so be aware of timeline. Good luck!1 comment1"

MasterAnswered on 14 Aug 2019Be prepared to learn a lot, and have less time for yourself if you are going sales / entreprenuership.I would ask you to understand yourself first. What is your current skillset? Which are the money making 1? Who will pay for your skillset? This is the most important to understand. If not, you can't even negotiate in a job interview.Then from there, go towards your financial goal. IF you can't type out and convince anyone, who will be confident that you can achieve it? IF you are inexperienced, go and take experiences now. Be it in intern etc etc.
3k debts is easily settled ($500 a month X 7 months to include horrendous interest rates).But always have a goal in mind.0 comments0"
