1,"CPF BoardLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jun 2019Hi,The CPF system is designed to meet the needs of the majority. Allowing members below the age of 55 to top up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum will mostly benefit the higher-income members. Members below the age of 55 can receive top-ups to their Special Account up to the current Full Retirement Sum. Members who desire an even higher standard of living during retirement can still save beyond the CPF system.Thank you.0 comments8"
