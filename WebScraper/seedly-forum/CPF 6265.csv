question,CPF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Jan 2019Can I get back my remaining CPF money after I hit FRS?Assuming I top up my RA yearly and eventually hit 1M at 65. What happens to the remaining money when I hit FRS? Am I able to get it back? I read from the CPF that you are unable to withdraw the amount of money you top up and interest gain from it.1 answerAnswerBump0

WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019After setting aside your Full Retirement Sum or Basic Retirement Sum with sufficient CPF property charge/pledge, you can choose to withdraw the remaining CPF balances (excluding top-up monies, government grants, and interest earned in your Retirement Account), or continue to keep your savings in CPF to earn attractive interest. ​​​You can withdraw up to $5,000 of your Ordinary and Special Account savings even if you are unable to set aside your Full Retirement Sum or Basic Retirement Sum with sufficient CPF property charge/pledge. 1 comment0"
