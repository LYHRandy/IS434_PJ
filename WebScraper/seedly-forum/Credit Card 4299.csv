MasterAnswered on 20 Jun 2019Off hand I can recall, for credit cards that gives you rewards points that you can use to redeem miles and/or other stuff like vouchers, you can choose the following:1) DBS Altitude Card - points don't expire2) OCBC Titanium Rewards - 2 years fee waiver3) Citi Rewards Card4) AMEX Rewards Card5) DBS Women Card - Points expire in a year thoughThere are more but these are the popular ones.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 22 Sep 2018I think you should focus on miles or Cashback not both ​but most DBS cards allow you to do both with no expiry. Try the attitude card or something from Citibank like the rewards card0 comments0"
