1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Apr 2019Hello!Dollar Cost Averagingis when you invest the same amount of money at standard intevals, regardless of share price. By doing so, it is likely that you will buy more shares when the prices are lower and fewer shares when the prices are high. Thus, in the long run, it is likely that it will help you to smoothen out the average purchase price of your shares. Value AveragingOn the other hand, value avergaing invloes changing how much you invest periodically. For value avergaing, you start with the end goal in mind and work toward your target number. In conclusion, for DCA, you are always contributing the same amount of money so you buy shares regardless of the price. While for value investing, you will buy when the shares are lower.0 comments0"
