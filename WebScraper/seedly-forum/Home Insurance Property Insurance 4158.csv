3,"YY Yin Yu14 Jun 2018yes, i agree. So which home insurance plan you get? and why you choose that plan?Ck Chai14 Jun 2018Previously my parents bought through AIG, but after comparison, though slightly higher than the special renewal price, I go for GE homecover.  Price is much cheaper than most with my desired amount of coverage for each area.  Plus point is my friend is specialized in general ins in this aspect.  But of course, if the price variant is too big, I will definitely go for the cheapest.  I go for the 3 years plan which gets a bit of discount.  :P"

God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Home contents Insurance or Mortgage Insurance?​One covers damages and 3rd party liability, like fires, water damage, etc.​Mortgage insurance pays for the remainder of the loan when the payer of the loan passes away.​Both is important in my opinion because damages can be quite expensive, and your home mortgage is a liability than you can transfer the risk to an insurer.1 comment0"
