1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Hello! Financial advisors can help you determine your risk appetite through psychometric test! Another possible method is to take online assessments. Many investment websites have assessments that can help you get an idea of your risk tolerance. While these online test are less accurate, it is convenient and will help you get started. I personally use this Investment Risk Tolerance Assessment developed by University of Missouri.0 comments0"

All the robo advisories actually make you go through one of them before funding the account. I suggest starting there.0 comments0"
