1,"AmkaesLevel 2. RookieAnswered 4w agoHello! There actually isn't much difference except that the NUSSU card charges an annual fee of $10 after 4 years. A live chat officer told me that NUS students sometimes would choose the NUSSU card cos the design is nicer and have the NUS logo HAHA. Novelty sake, I guess!0 comments1"
