1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Hey, I'm currently an NSF too. Didn't indicate interest to go for command school and I just got posted to become a Signal Operator as I'm not one of those who love military activities, outfield etc. But my commander told me that since this 2 years is compulsory, so why not give it my all? So it depends on oneself. Currently I believe that it'll go up slightly with the combat allowance and as I get promoted in the near future. Basically, I opened a POSB Save As You Serve (SAYE) account and allocated $400 of my monthly salary into that account where it'll be automatically GIRO-ed on the 11th of every month. This account will give me 2% interest on the amount inside after I ORD, assuming that I do not make any withdrawals which I don't foresee I would. You can consider it since it forces you to save and offers an attractive interest rate. You can check it out here - https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/sayeI also invest $100 monthly into Stashaway, adopting the dollar cost averaging method. With limited salary, I chose to invest in US ETFs over the Singapore STI ETF due to better diversification and historic performance. You can choose to DCA on both as well. My remaining money goes to other expenses such as food, transport and telco bills. I have emergency funds and my life savings parked in CIMB Fastsaver to earn 1% interest instead of 0.05% with the old POSBkids account or my DBS Remix savings account which I use to receive my salary through. Within the CIMB Fastsaver, I opened a Fixed Deposit account and parked quite a sum for 12 months to get 1.84% interest as CIMB is currently offering that promotional rate due to their 9th birthday. I do not foresee that I'll need these funds that are parked in the SAYE and FD account as I'm a stay in NSF and am just saving for further studies as I'll be pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Nanyang Technological University after I ORD in 2020. Even should I need those funds urgently, I can easily make a withdrawal, just that I'll lose the additional interest that I could have potentially earned. All the best in your NS journey and look forward to ORD!0 comments1"
2,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You are really disciplined man! And starting way earlier than many of us here :) Which is great! For me, when I was an NSF, I earned around $1k, saved about $500, spent the other half, I was stay in. While learning to invest via books and audiobooks. ​After I ORD, I immediately went to learn a new language (french), and scuba diving, using my saved up money. Something which I would recommend you to do also :) ​Don't just save up for the sake of it, but try to upgrade yourself and experience new stuff along the way! 2 comments1"
3,"Question Poster15 May 2019Hello, thank you for your reply. Just wanted to update this. I will ord as private (I didn’t finish BMT so $590 all the way) next month and it’s been a learning experience to read the contributions here on seedly so thank you! It’s been a tough journey on savings. There are many days where I lose my discipline and over spend. So far I’m happy to have accumulated and saved $1.7K in total assets (cash and investments) since this question was posted. I stopped STI ETF and focused on my StashAway to focus on my goals. I sold 3/4 of my STI units and that’s my first encounter of fear wh... (more)Kenneth Lou15 May 2019Hey friend! Really really awesome man. :) Looking forward to hear about your journey as well.

4,"ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Sep 2018It's hard to allocate it per month based for me cos my spending monthly are pretty diverse! I've got about $1k a month as I'm a signal spec.But well $200 will go to STI ETF/BOND ABF (half half).
About $500 goes into POSB SAYE. 
About $200 goes to my parentsOnce in a while I'd put $1000 in SSB if it looks good! 
Once in a while I'd also take a look at the stock market and get certain undervalued stocks which have pretty good returns.I've got an amount of money parked in FS which I don't touch.. returns are re'invested' so guess that's great as well! Some are placed in robo early on.2 months to ORD and there goes my allowance hahahaha 0 comments0"

9,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Sep 2018When i was NSF, I just focused on saving. Save up a big amount to pay down the incoming student debt first.​If you are not furthering studies after that, then you can start to invest with it. Savings is key, reduce all expenses too. 0 comments0"
