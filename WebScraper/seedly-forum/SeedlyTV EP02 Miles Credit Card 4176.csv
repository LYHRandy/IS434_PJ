WonderkidAnswered on 10 Apr 2019Yes, you can.There'll be services fees involved:  https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/us/ppsclub-krisflyer/forms-and-fees/service-fees/ The easiest way is to cancel your SQ J Saver, redeposit the miles (USD75), and book your new SQ Suites Saver. It'll cost the same as changing date (USD25), route (USD25), and cabin class (USD25).0 comments0"
