God of WisdomAnswered on 23 Sep 2019Perhaps you could be a little more specific with your question here.Do you mean what the community thinks of POEMS as a platform that you can open an account and trade totally online?Or are you referring to the online brokerage rates vs the broker-assisted brokerage rates?2 comments4"
2,"Question Poster23 Sep 2019Yep, comparing the brokerage fees with others. Just want to know which is the best in terms of service and ratesElijah Lee23 Sep 2019The rates are public information, and most major brokerage firm rates are in line with each other, especially for SG market, or else you will have everyone running for the cheapest broker. What's more important is to find a broker who can provide you the support you need in your journey. Do note that in Phillip, one can have multiple accounts to be served by multiple brokers, so that you can see who you want to work with. Others, like DBS, only allow you to have one account."
