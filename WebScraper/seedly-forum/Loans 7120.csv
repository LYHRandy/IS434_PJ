question,"Loans Asked by Takingstock @Asked on 16 Jun 2019As a creditor to a friend, what would you ask the debtor or Official Assignee (to protect your rights and $$) at creditor's meeting (before they proceed to the voluntary bankruptcy judgment)?Heavy this is. I took a leap of faith, to lend this friend 5700, of which 3950 was the prepaid fees to file for voluntary bankruptcy.The declared debt is primarily credit card and credit lines, and works out to be 2 years of his take home income, and he has not declared all amounts borrowed from friends (including my 5700). Kinda torn whether to push for the benefits of other friends who also lent him $$.To be nice, or be worried and be hurt?1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterUpdated on 17 Jun 2019Hey there sorry but please stop your friend to apply for his self voluntary bankruptcy proceeding. If a creditor applied for his bankruptcy, they can recover the application deposit of $1850. I have no idea where the remaining $2k plus goes to;did your friend let you know?https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/io/en/bankruptcy-and-debt-repayment-scheme/information-for-bankrupts1.html6 comments1"

We do have doubts on his credibility for sure.Charmaine Ng17 Jun 2019It's hard to take but hopefully he learns from the experience. Also hoping that you got your money back!
