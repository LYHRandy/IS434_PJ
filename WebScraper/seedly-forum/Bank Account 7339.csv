1,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Based on how much you have in that account. If you have more than 15k go for maxigain. If you have lesser than 15k(few thousands) go for cimb fastsaver. If you have salary credited and meets DBS multiplier, Park in there and do the requirements for higher interest. But don't just blindly spend to meet the interest. If its not a necessity to spend, just look at maxigain or fastsaver. 0 comments6"
2,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 23 Jul 2018Check out DBS Multiplier if you can meet the salary crediting criteria.
For higher interest savings account without salary crediting requirement, 
1) can put in CIMB Fast Saver for fuss free 1% with minimal S$1k balance. 
2) If you have spare S$15k can consider Citibank Maxigain. Interest rate per annum is 1.2% with monthly step up to 2.4% (based on current sibor rate) 0 comments6"

5,JianHao SooLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Can also consider putting it in SSB as it gives higher interest than CIMB Fast Saver (of 1%) and it has the flexibility to withdrawl early at a penalty of $2. 0 comments4
