2,"Question Poster14 Dec 2018Agree with you. Gold is a universal money. Precious metals always win, especially in post-war where thereâ€™s a ridiculous inflation. The other most important commodities would be Food and water. Water would probably be as expensive as gold today. But who knows... "

It will totally depend on what is the reason of war and which countries are involved in the war.Gold is always considered a safe haven for investment during the critical situation even in the global market.0 comments1"
4,"Yinglin ChuaLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019War in backyard? Depends on whether the banks, sgx, data centers, factories, offices etc survive the bombing. If they do, there is a rare chance you may see your investments again. Though of course, likelihood is that the ""local companies"" do not survive well - imagine half or more of the employees dead or the factories bombed.I think it's better to count one's blessings that he is still alive (or sometimes better dead).At that point, it's likely everyone starts anew... and is more concerned about basic survival and maybe bartering for limited resources.Just look at the other wars for inspiration?Safe place to park is where there is no war. E.g. other countries. Or if you are talking about gold or silver.. find a good place to bury it and make sure it's not stolen by thieves. It will come in handy if you survive.If am not wrong, your insurance is excluded from payouts in time of war. But you may still be covered when war ends, if the insurance companies are based overseas and survive? Or come back after the country restructures? Then again, it's either they honour it (based on what's in their system) or you can find your policy documents... Maybe. Just maybe. I don't know.1 comment0"
