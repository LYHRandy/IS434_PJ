1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 27 Mar 2019For me it was John C Bogle, the father of Index Funding (may he rest in peace). I think I chanced upon his book as I was looking for financial books to read to start me on my investment journey in the university library which didn't look too boring to me and was quite easy to digest. His wisdom is simplistic and easy to follow, yet quite profound at the same time - why look to buy a winning stock and fail most of the time, when you can just buy the whole market and win together with the economy? Of course, I am simplifying things, but he truly set me on a path to understanding more about how the markets work, and the difficulties of trying to win it. (doesn't stop me from trying my best to do so though!)The book was called ""the little book of common sense investing"" which I still remember very vividly till today.0 comments0"

I read his value investing tools and techique book and got influenced on value investing. After that I know my current co-founder of Fundamental Scorecard website. He also influence significantly and got me interested in the ways of investing via Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.0 comments0
4,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Mar 2019Most people would say Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad. It's a very interesting, well written piece of work. Of course, as I continued my investment journey, I've looked at much larger investors, past and future models alike. The book is a very good stepping stone for your child, and you may want to integrate some of it into your own parenting. Best of luck,Money Maverick0 comments0"
