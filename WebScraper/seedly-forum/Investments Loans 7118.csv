2,"T@Takingstock @16 Jun 2019Highly risky. I mean after I got into the bankruptcy case of my friend, I am very torn why lend money because the more the bankrupt sank into debt, the more likely he is just running off with the money. Instead of getting a proper loan with interest, its likely making someone worse off too.

3,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 16 Jun 2019If your investment is setting up a business, there are business loans. But if you investments are stocks and reits etc, this is just leveraged investing.And it often doesn't end well. If your investments fail you might push yourself towards bankruptcy.Even if you don't, the interest on such loans are probably not low, and you will be overrun by it eventually.The safest and best way is to budget and plan out your investments over a period of time.Sorry, the things that seem too good to be true, usually aren't, and will only push you in deep.0 comments1"

MasterUpdated on 16 Jun 2019Any loans less than a month..for those longer loans, you can choose to pay a heavier interest penalty and risk your credit rating if you fail to pay your monthly repayments.the only loan that might work without interest would be FML. Aka Father Mother loan0 comments1"

For other loans say to fund your investments; more information is required. Sorry to burst your bubbles but nobody would loan you money and not take any mortgages or monthly payment and have in good faith that you'd pay them back at end of the loan tenure unless it's close friends and families (maybe you can try that). If you have a sound business prospect; going for schemes for SME could be an avenue but since you did not clarify the kind of investments you're talking about it's quite difficult to assess.0 comments1"

If banks gave everybody money, without earning something from the interest rates, they wouldn’t bare the name bank. Alternatively, you can try licensed moneylender (You can find a full list of licensed moneylenders on the Ministry of Law's website) it's speedier (30 minutes you can get the loan), faster and easier approval (they don't care if you've poor credit standing). The only downside is the higher interest rates.
But should your investment prove to yield high returns, you'll be able to pay off the loans in no time :)0 comments0"
