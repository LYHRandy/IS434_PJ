1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Nov 2018It'll take it as a 2-part question. Your first job will depend a lot more on your results in uni and whether you have relevant experience from intern/work. Subsequent jobs will rely on your experience from prior job(s). It depends who are you comparing with. If you are comparing to those graduated from uni and have found a job at 25-ish, there will be some difference. You can always make up for it through career progression. If you are comparing with poly grads who have worked significantly longer, remember the starting pay is different. Starting pay for poly grad is $2237 (2017) while degree holders are about $3000. Work for a few more years and you'll catch up.0 comments0"
