God of WisdomUpdated on 02 Jul 2019I will link you to 3 reviews here where the Milelion, Mainly Miles and The ShuttleWhale have gone on the record to state their views on the card:https://mainlymiles.com/2019/04/24/credit-card-review-krisflyer-uob-mastercard/https://milelion.com/2019/04/23/a-review-of-the-new-krisflyer-uob-credit-card/https://theshutterwhale.com/blog/2019/4/23/brand-new-krisflyer-uob-credit-card-offers-3-miles-per-dollar-no-cap-on-dining-transport-online-shopping-and-singapore-airlinesNeedless to say, the 'accelerated miles' feature doesn't even feel accelerated to the 3 of them. (Or me)If you ask me for my opinion, I'll stick to my CitiPremier Miles any day. Considering thatI don't fly SQ/Scoot/SilkAir all that oftenA lot of my spending is less than $5 (which would earn me nothing on UOB, think tea or coffee, or the occasional muffin meal from McDonald's)I don't dine out all that oftenI don't use food delivery at all. (Yes I did order pizza once in a while, but UOB is looking at services like deliveroo/grabfood)Travel spending is more rewarding with Citi (they have a variety of bonuses on Expedia,Kaligo,Agoda, only if you use a Citi PM card)My travel expenditure is flat capped at $120 for my monthly adult travel pass.... I have no reason to use that card.Your mileage may vary (pun intended!) so do your own analysis of your expenditure patterns before committing. (Edit: Formatting!)0 comments4"
