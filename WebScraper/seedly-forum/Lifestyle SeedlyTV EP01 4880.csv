1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Apr 2019Kudos to you on learning the value of prudence from a young age! I would personally look to increase my income (since there is a limit to how much you can cut savings). Find side jobs, like giving private tuition at night and on weekends, or even internships with flexible hours :)Once you have built a good base of money that you can put to investments, then start allocating capital accordingly :)0 comments1"

I would recommend you start by learning more about personal finance from googling and reading some personal finance books which you can do so by going down to the library or using the NLB app. When you have any doubts, you can google the questions or come to seedly and post your questions then the community will help you out.
