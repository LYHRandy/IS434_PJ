It diversifies your capital across Singapore's biggest listed companies on the stock market even though your starting capital is smaller. Your one-off sum, if regularly put in, can easily buy you 1 - 2 stocks each time while minimising brokerage fees so that it is worth it. Over time, that can build up a good starting portfolio. 0 comments0"
