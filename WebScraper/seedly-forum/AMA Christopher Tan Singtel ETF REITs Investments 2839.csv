I have to say that I am not an expert in stocks so I might not be of any help here. Personally, I prefer to invest in a portfolio of low cost ETFs or Dimensional funds. It allows me to diversify my investments over thousands of stocks at a low cost. All the best.0 comments0"
3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jan 2019Why specifically SingTel? I suggest you to read up on the various types of investments and tips offered by various articles/blogs/books/gurus. Afterwards, triangulate and corrobate a few methods and start working on those. Each of us have different risk threshold, different yield appetite (though no one would dimiss 200% returns) and it is not possible to specifically recommend you a stock portfolio without full knowing of your demographic. Also, it is better to take charge of your own money since who fears losing your money more than yourself? Although the process is time consuming, I believe this method is much more effective. All the best!0 comments0"
