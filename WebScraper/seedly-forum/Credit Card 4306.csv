Use Excel list down all your monthly spending , all cost and income. This will allow you to know where your $ goes to. Reduce your other non mandatory expenses such as restaurant , reduce cigarettes cost if you smoke, skip grab and take all public transport. If you have no contract with Telco then switch to a no sim lower monthly subscription plan. Reduce daily food expenses. Doing all the above will allow you to squeeze out at least $100 to $200. Use this to repay your 3k faster. Do part-time job such as delivery for the food apps (foodpanda, honest bee etc) or any other part time. With the extra income , it can help reduce your 3k faster. All in all doing the above will help repay your 3k debts within a year or even faster like 6 months , depends on how desperate you're willing to do to quickly repay the debts. ‚ÄãAll the best !

WizardAnswered on 03 May 2018Reduce expenses if possible.Direct more of your pay into repaying the debt.If you cannot resist the credit card temptation, you can cancel it and get a debit card instead.DO NOT borrow money to pay this debt. Borrowing more to pay another debt is just a vicious cycle.If you really into trouble and need professional help to solve the debts, visit https://www.abs.org.sg/consumer-banking/consumers/debt-consolidation-plan‚ÄãI assume this debt is credit card debt, do your best to pay it all off asap. Because credit card debt incurs and compound interest extremely fast and can drown a person in even more debt.‚Äã‚Äã0 comments2"

Yes. Cancel your credit card and use a debit card instead if you are really into saving with spending when the debit card offers cash back.Making money as you spend is better then paying more when you spend due to late payment or interest from credit card debt.$3k is still a manageable sum so is better to clear it asap and work towards savings.You need savings to propel toward your future and not just striking or rich.Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments1"

7,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Curb your spending habits. Undergo financial  counselling if you really have difficulty curbing your spending habits. Set a credit card limit of $1000 to limit your spending. You need not cancel your credit card if you could control your impulses. Think before you spend. 0 comments1
8,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 20 Sep 2018First off, read the budgeting articles in seedly, and set up your spending budgetfor now avoid using credit card (lock it at home) until you learn how to control your spending.make sure you are using the current account with the best interest rate (every penny counts here)set a target monthly amount to pay back the loan.consider how to get extra cash, e.g. sell off any unwanted items on carousell, give tuition, etc‚Äãmost efficient way is to live an austere life for a short period to clear the debt, then you can start to relax...a bit. If you are getting $2000 - 2500, I would target to clear the debt within a year, extremely doable, less than 6 months if your really stingy on yourself, packed lunch, no cabs, etc.. (please do not plan for holiday, or sign up for any grooming / gym packages until after you pay back your debt) Chinese saying, chang tong  bu ru duan tong. Short term pain better than Long term painbasically clear your debt before you start seriously saving. The interest for the debt is way higher than what you are getting for your savings.and think on the bright side. If you can target $X per month for the debt, and get use to living this way. That's the extra savings you can get for retirement & investment after you clear your debt.‚ÄãThis is a bad example, but if your parents are well off, can consider getting a loan off them for this credit card loan, but have to be discipline to pay them off monthly at a smaller interest then what the bank is charging. You need to agree with them the monthly amount and how long you'll take to pay them back (This is purely to lower the interest charge). Key Word, LOAN, INTEREST, PAY THEM BACK0 comments0"

10,"Thanh DatLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Sep 20183k debts in credit cards, every month you will need to pay off your credit monthly financial charge. If you are spending more then you pay your bills..once your debt go up to $5k. You can be paying under $200 alone just on financial charge. NOW go take up a personal bank loan. Clear up your credit card bill. You can use your credit card to take up the personal loan. But be sure you cut down on using your credit card. And your personal loan you how long you want to repayments to the bank. 2 years..3 years EVERY MONTH. if you are paying the financial charge..why not take up personal loan to clear all. So it will become manageable for you. But if you keep up to use your credit card. Good luck to you0 comments0"
11,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018You have to pay off the debt even if you cancel your card now. Find ways to reduce your expenditure, or find a way to increase your income and use this to pay down your debt ASAP. You won't want to be caught in a situation where you are barred from applying for credit cards in future. Talk to the bank and see if a plan can be worked out, then stick to it. Hope you can get out of this hole soon, and do learn from this lesson. You seem quite young, so don't let this issue carry on further into your adult life. Cheers 0 comments0"

13,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Track your expenses. Have enough discipline to record your expenses, then try to cut down on unnecessary spendings.I would suggest cancelling your credit card(s). Don't think you'll want to live the nightmare of trying to pay off the 20+% of credit card debts.Have a plan. And stick to it!0 comments0"
14,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 30 Jul 2018If you feel you don't have the discipline in using credit cards, I suggest to cancel it. Credit card debt has high interest rate. Possible to borrow from family to pay back before the amount snowball? You can work out repayment time line and start a fresh with lesser damage than slowly repaying your debt to the bank. 0 comments0"

It wasn't long before I realised it is a huge mistake.‚ÄãThis is mainly because:1) Having just entered workforce, our salary will not be able to handle possible late payments2) Having just entered the workforce, we tend to have a shopping spree mentality, purchasing things we cannot afford when we are schooling. ‚ÄãThese contributes to us spending recklessly. Cancelling all the credit card was the best thing that happened to me then. Of course, when you form a good habit of budgeting, get your preferred credit card for Cashbacks or Miles!‚ÄãNow, priority will be to clear those debts.Here's are two methods to help you:Snowball Method and Avalanche Method, both proven to work.Read about it here: https://blog.seedly.sg/hacks-to-clear-your-debts-fast-and-effectively/1 comment1"
16,"Yong Zheng16 Oct 2018Hi, I do have the same problem with you when I started working. After which I make sure that I spend within my mean, I will make sure that I able to pay off the credit card bill and not incur interest. You have to look into why you accumulate the $3k debt. Over different purchases or 1 big item? If is 1 big item, and really need to buy it, you can check with bank/shop if they have installment plan without interest. If is over few purchases, you will need to look into your expenses over your income. You are overspending. Spending habits is very important which we need to cultivate. Onc... (more)"
