Only if you pick the right pieces.Additionally, you will be looking out not just for authenticity and craftsmenship, but also demand. Ultimately, if you are looking for watches as an investment, you would be looking for a coveted item that can command high prices from buyers later in the future.Advantages:#HIGHSESlife - but seriously though, some people do feel compelled to dress the part especially when doing business. If I wore a watch though, I would just wear one that serves its function, and not wear my investment pieces out.Family heirloom. Remember the iconic Patek Philippe slogan: 'You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation.' A Patek watch does not merely tell time. It’s an heirloom that transfers values across generations.” Ah, the allure of marketing like that.Diversifying your portfolio. It is important that you conside the demand of it though. So it's important that it's piece that you will enjoy, even if the demand for it goes down.0 comments2"

Beside the technical knowledge of the brand , heritage, exclusivity, availability of the watches, One important thing u require is the social connections. You have to know enough people, the right people to have the opportunity. Knowing which watch is valuable is not enough, u need to have the opportunity to buy the watch, and at a good price. And when u want to sell, u need to find the right person willingly to pay for the watch. IF u were to go through a dealer, middleman, or auction house, (to buy or sell) your margins will be  severely cut. It is like artworks, wine or even handbags. Above all, u also need to know which series will be in demand. Unless u yourself are in the industry or a collector, it will be hard to invest in these. Even if tell u the returns are good, u wouldnt be able to take advantage of it as the barrier of entry are high. Of course there are indirect ways, There are funds that invests in non conventionally assets. Wines funds should be among the more commonly heard. Or if u are well affluent and connected, u might have access to private equities that invest in these areas. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 14 Dec 2018Interesting question (I presume you're refering to non precious metal/diamond embedded watches)...I dont invest in watches so I don't have much technical know-hows of watches. But I suppose it's all about demand and supply and more importantly the brand. Although not regarded as the best timepiece makers, Rolex is certainly a household name and probably a reason why its watches increases in value over time.0 comments0"
