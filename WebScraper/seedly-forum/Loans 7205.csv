1,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Can I share my experience with you? I got cheated by my friend‚Äòs bro by loaning him for capital start up and he run away with the $30K which I have been saving hard for more than 10 yrs!
‚Äã‚ÄãFelt anguish for my stupidity, esp after sometime, I feel that my friend may have played a part in the  scam! I do not earn much, $30K is an hefty amount! I dare not even share with anyone and been living in sorrow for years. üò≠ Even with police report, it‚Äôs useless as he‚Äòs gone. ‚ÄãYes, it sucks to know someone is enjoying life with your hard earned money, but to continue dueling with it only makes yourself more miserable... What‚Äôs lost is lost, and life must go on.  I just gotta suck thumb & acknowledged that money is gone forever and start from scratch again. ‚ÄãIt‚Äôs not easy, and I feel embarassed to share the miserable amount of savings I have, at this age. But I finally saved enough emergency fund to cover for myself & my old folks, and working  towards better financial & retirement planning. Now I‚Äôm waiting for karma to fall upon the Scammer. May you move on and be a happier person. üôèüèª1 comment1"

4,"Ng Lip Hong KyithLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi, Firstly we are trying very hard to understand what you are saying. It seems in reverse order. Do you mean your friend act poor thing so you lend the money, to your ex colleague, then he ran away so the debt collector is coming after you with $1200?‚ÄãAre  you the guarantor in the first place? If you are not the guarantor just file a police report and tell them off. Find some means to hunt down your ex-colleague. Hard but I am afraid you may not get your money back.1 comment1"
