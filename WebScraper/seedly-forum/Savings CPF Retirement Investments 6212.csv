God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For your ETF and MF, I'll need to see where it's allocated. You can have it all in just the Singapore market, or China for all we know.In terms of expected net portfolio return and total capital invested above inflation rate ratio, you're quite healthy.You may want to do some risk portfolio planning. If you're all invested in purely equities, you may want to add some fixed income exposure.3 comments2"

Don't quite believe in it in the long run. Allocate more to Asia Funds, some emerging market, and more in US and Europe. You want global diversification."
