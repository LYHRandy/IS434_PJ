ProdigyAnswered 3d agoTraditionally speaking, an online marketplace is one of the least capital intensive models, but it also means that it has one of the lowest barriers of entry. To figure out how much money you need to start an online marketplace, you first need to identify and understand very well the problems that you’re trying to solve/solutions you’re providing for the market. From there you’ll be able to define your go-to-market strategy by gauging how strong your true value proposition* is.
With regards to your go-to-market strategy, are you planning for a “growth at cost” strategy? This means acquiring suppliers (merchants) at a lost making rate and/or acquiring demand (customers) at CAC > LTV value to obtain market share in a short period of time. Which means that you're gonna need a whole lot more money to survive the bloodshed.
(E.g. all the companies you’ve listed above, none of them are in the green, they’re still burning millions of cash year on year)
Or do you plan to focus and invest your capital in building an amazing product (aka the marketplace platform) while using technology and suppliers offerings as your main product differentiators? With that newly created/built true value propositions, you can then scale and acquire more suppliers (merchants).
More often than not, having the best product (your marketplace platform) and suppliers (merchants) offerings increases the chances of you winning over the market share while maintaining positive unit economics. Quoting Mark Zuckerberg’s advice to the founders of Airbnb when the then $90+ mil funded Wimdu (a rocket internet company), who dominated the market share in Europe came knocking asking for an acquisition, “Don’t buy. Whoever has the best product will win.”
Airbnb is now a multi-million profitable company. Wimdu ceased operations in 2018.As in today’s context, the $50k which you've probably spend years saving can be expended by a well-funded company in a matter of minutes.Hope this helps!0 comments2"

RookieAnswered 2d agoTBVH, but that's just my own opinion, is that the whole ecommerce platform space is rather crowded, and with the industry already consolidating nicely to 3-4 players (L, Shopee, Q10, Amz), there might not be much space here in SG to start.However, if you look at more frontier markets like VN or MM, the Internet space may not be that mature. If you have some nativity in those countries, replicating a matured business model in SG and starting it there might give you a bit more breathing space than in the arms race already happening here.ShopBack and Shopee/LZ has very different business models and value propositions to the merchants they serve. The thing to ask yourself is where do your core strengths lie? Performance marketing? Logistics? Customer experience? And then build your platform around that.Money wise, depends on how spartan you want your post-founder lifestyle to be. The day of the launch is glamorouse, after that it's eating grass. Some VCs recommend anywhere from 12-24 of your last drawn salary. My take is, if you can drastically adjust your lifestyle, you might survive with less than that before you raise a round.Sources: bought and assembled ShopBack's first 10 ikea tables0 comments0"
