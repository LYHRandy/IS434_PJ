1,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Aug 2019Hi OP,Congrats on taking the first step to owning your home. As you mentioned, Tengah will indeed take a while to be developed- personally, I view it as the Punggol of the West. Do consider other BTO estates that will be made available: I heard that the Nov 19 Yio Chu Kang BTO based on the site of Chao Yang School, behind Presbyterian High School has garnered quite a bit of interest. You seem to be in the same shoes as a question I answered earlier, so do take a look at the answers: https://seedly.sg/questions/need-advice-on-getting-a-resale-flat-after-4-unsuccessful-bto-applications?aid=18070All the best for your housing Journey!0 comments0"
