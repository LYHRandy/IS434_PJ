MasterAnswered on 29 Apr 2019Any portfolio designed for an only 5 year return and trying to achieve a net positive can't have a risk profile that's higher than Balanced. In fact, even then - despite all diversified portfolios making money after 10 years, there's still a little risk. So if you've been placed in 80, or 100% equities, the person who you're working with has no idea what they're doing. I would suggest looking out for that. If you'd like a second opinion from an investment specialist who would design an asset allocation that is more suitable for a 5 year tenure, you can drop me a message.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
