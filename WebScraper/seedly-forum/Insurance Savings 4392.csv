question,"Insurance Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked 3w agoShould I keep my 20-year PruWealth plan I bought last year? Is it an endowment or ILP?Bought a PruWealth 20 year plan in 2018 from my insurance agent. Will be paying $3679.22 a year ($300/mth, $52.66/year for Crisis Waiver III and $26.66/year for Early Stage Crisis Waiver) for the next 20 years.On hindsight, I think that money could have been put to better use - like pumping it to robo-advisor or ETFs. Should I keep it and treat it as a forced savings for the next 19 years, or surrender it now and I think I'll lose the $3679 I've put in? I'm 26yo and will be 47 when it matures.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoIt's a perpetual endowment plan. You're invested and participate in the return of a conservative portfolio of around 30% Equity 65% Bond 5% Property portfolio that provides a floor of guarantee.Such endowment plans are meant to be kept for a very long time. If kept for more than 20 to 30 years, you'll get a projected 4 ish % return.The policy doesn't mature, is capital guaranteed, and allows you withdrawals while staying invested after your premium commitment.You can treat it as part of your fixed-income component in your investments.0 comments4"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2w agoHi there, do you remember why you bought the PruWealth plan? Can revisit that or check with the agent who sold you the policy. Wealth accumulation plans should come with a purpose - be it forced savings or for retirement or other matters.PruWealth is an endowment plan. At 20 years, the capital is guaranteed and you're free to withdraw from it minimum $1,000 up to the cash value at the point in time. The balance that you leave with Prudential will grow with you until you reach 99 years old.Compared to robo-advisors and ETFs, robo-advisors and ETFs are non-capital guaranteed. Depending on when you need the money, you may end up having less than what you start off with.I hope you are not just saving $300 plus monthly. If you're saving more then the excess savings can be used in robo-advisors and ETFs if you feel that you're up for the risk. But whatever the outcome is for your robo-advisors and ETFs, you know that you'll have some money with PruWealth 20 years down the road.
So you can invest money with a peace of mind.0 comments0"
