God of WisdomAnswered on 08 Jun 2019Dude you're way too exposed to just one asset class, property. I'd limit property to about 40% of your entire portfolio which includes your residence.30% Equity
15% Bond
40% Property
5% Cash
5-7% Commodities & Collectibles

2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 08 Jun 2019While you mention you have a high risk appetite, what is your holding period like? Imo it's too highly weighted on property. Additionally, does the private property have a high rental yield, or for your own stay?I would look to diversify it further into equities, ETFs, bonds etc.0 comments1"
3,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 09 Jun 2019I’m not sure if what I’m doing is right. But I would first take property if it is home stay, and emergency cash out of the equation, as I consider these none tradable investments. Then distribute the remaining amount into a mixed portfolio. Leave property in if it is a second property.0 comments0"
