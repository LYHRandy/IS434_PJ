2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Mar 2019Seeing this sparked my curiousity as well. Never really thought about this esp for a country like SG with huge reserves.Found this recent article when I googledhttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/explainer-why-borrow-when-you-have-budget-surplus#cxrecs_sHere are the main points written: “When cost is being spread over many years, the generations that use it share the cost. Compared to frontloading the cost within the first and second year (of the project), the economy in general bear the brunt of cost, but the rest of the future generations get to enjoy with little or no cost,”  Mr Gan said.Besides intergenerational equity, Mr Seah said that a secondary reason for opting to borrow could be because there might be fewer recurring revenue sources in the Government’s budget to fund infrastructure projects, as a greater amount of recurring expenditure is being funnelled towards social welfare programmes such as healthcare and education.0 comments0"
