question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Nov 2018I just joined a MNC 6 months ago to do finance but recently my boss instead gives me a ton of ancillary tasks like video. How should I voice out or quit to find another job because I'm not developing?I'm a 26 year old analyst who joined a MNC recently which my primary role was to do finance and analysis. However, recently, my boss has been giving me a ton of ancillary work to do, which includes planning for marketing events and doing video editing. Should I be flexible and accept this? But I feel like this was not what I was hired to do, let alone, I feel like I'm not developing more core skillsets which was supposed to be finance. Need help from other people who had similar experiences?9 answersAnswerBump0"

These side jobs bring indirect value only for as long as you work in the company such as gaining exposure to other business areas, socialising with other bosses, showing-off your soft skills. These opportunities are good if you do it well.0 comments4"

The world is changing with technology your new skill sets might open new doors while being A specialist is good you never know when you might be replaced.if you do it well this might become your bargaining chip to better things in the company.After a while have a honest chat with your boss on your progression and aspirations. If at end state the answer is still status quo and you are not happy with it then you can decide to move on to a new job0 comments2"
3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Nov 2018Do it. And do it well.Building skill sets in various fields other than your core competency will do you good in the near future.Taking on more responsibilities and achieving a better than expected outcome shows that you're willing to do what it takes to prove your salt. And if it helps your company make more money, why not?I would also urge you to find out what would be a good KPI to the tasks you'll be doing.Because you can then tell your boss he should hire a professional and here are the guidelines to supervise his deliverables.In this scenario, you'll be delegating instead of Tai chi-ing away work.Pretty impressive if you ask me. 0 comments2"
4,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 02 Dec 2018This is the working world nowadays. Employers are facing a cheap labour crunch and so they are extremely reluctant to hire new workers. Instead, they pressure existing workers to take on menial jobs. So we all just have to deal with it. It is very common. As someone here mentioned, actually as long as it is not taking up too much of your time, dont be too troubled by it.If however, the side tasks are taking up too much of your time and are too menial, find a better job and jump ship. All the talk about self-development and ra ra positivity is not very helpful imo if basically u are just a convenient person to carry out menial and pointless tasks.Always put yourself first, not the company. No one will do it for you.0 comments1"
5,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 09 Nov 2018I'm going to share what i saw on facebook by PK! “Most companies are rational creatures. If you're truly value adding as a financial analyst (and a champion at that) then they'd be stupid to have you do anything else. While it's in their interest to develop you, the onus is on you to develop and upgrade yourself in your own time. So if you want to be a master at your core skillset then keep learning and growing in that direction, in the meantime they're probably giving you other tasks to justify your place in the company while you level up to a point where your value add to the company is aligned with what you want to do.In short, be flexible yes but don't accept the status quo. Work your way constructively out of it in the direction you want. Prove yourself in small tasks if you want the big roles.You can be a grunt or a trailblazer. You decide. ;)”0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 09 Nov 2018Look at your development plan and what you intend to achieve.Talk to your boss about how that fits into your road plan - they may be trying to groom you for a more customer facing finance role, or possibly to take on a more visible profile with higher management...0 comments1"
7,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Nov 2018It will be good to be flexible to accept the other work assignment so that your boss will appreciate you better. However, if you are not comfortable,  you could perhaps speak to your boss regarding your jobscope. Whatever the case, do be tactfully and do not burn your bridge. 0 comments0"
