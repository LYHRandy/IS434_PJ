God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoHi Anon, it would be good to look at your timeframe, objectives before you decide.To diversify to foreign markets, you may want to consider UTs, especially in stock markets where you may want to have exposure, but are not available for direct investing. (FYI POEMS has access to all stock markets you listed). For example, one can consider a Vietnam UT if you do not have knowledge about the Vietnam market and the companies listing there.It is possible to have an investment portfolio of both growth and dividends. You do need to know which holding belongs to which portfolio. For your growth portfolio, do remember to watch your portfolio/watchlist for good entry and exit prices, and also when to cut loss and take profit. For a dividend portfolio, you need to take note of the sustainability of the dividends and find a good entry price to maximize yield and have a safety margin.As you are currently only holding equities, do consider diversification into other asset classes such as UT, ETF, etc. Speak with an independent advisor to fully understand your options and see how you may allocate your funds. Also, consider doing RSP into your investments over time to build your wealth. Your 50K, growing at 8%, will still take 27 years to grow to 400K, but by adding to your investments monthly, you can considerably shorten the time needed.0 comments2"

GeniusUpdated 2w agoHi,Great that you are setting up your portfolio.Portfolio management is the utmost important thing.So you may start off with simplified portfolio management: Three Bucket Strategies.First Bucket: Protection BucketGreat that you have set aside 24k as an emergency fund. I would suggest you add on insurance like Critical Illness Term Insurance and Hospitalization Insurance.Second Bucket: Passive Investment BucketIn this bucket, you would start by investing in ETFs, REITs or good dividend companies that could give you a return that at least hedge inflations or grow slightly faster than inflations. For example, GDP or Market growing at 4%, this bucket grow at 6-8%. So if you are looking at some of the countries like the US or China, you may look at some of the countries' specific ETFs.Third Bucket: Active Investment BucketIn this bucket, you would invest in growth companies that could potentially grow your portfolio fasters. However, do note that there is risk of investing in growth companies. Hence, have an understanding of the companies, analyze it deeper, and buying it at undervalue or at least a reasonable price, so you could get a long term return investing in it.
