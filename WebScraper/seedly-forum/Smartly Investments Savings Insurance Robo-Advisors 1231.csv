question,Smartly Investments Savings Insurance Robo-Advisors Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 May 2019Do you think it would be a good idea if I do daily saving into smartly and then withdraw when I have to pay for my premium for my insurance?As I'm a student trying to do a forced saving. I was thinking of using the small return earn by smartly to earn a bit of extra cash while doing a daily forced saving and then withdraw the amount need for the premium while keeping the extra return still in smartly account. Should I do a 10/10 profile or a lower profile if I'm doing this?1 answerAnswerBump1

1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Regular investing into smartly/roboadvisor is good. But your idea of withdrawing it to pay insurance premium is not.Investments will fluctuate and by withdrawing the investments at its downturn point would actually hurt the portfolio returns in the long term. If you need the daily savings to pay off insurance premiums, you should put it into a bank deposit or Singapore savings bonds. Just withdraw the singapore savings bonds 1 month before the premium due date.2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster19 May 2019But if i go for a conservative profile would be any better just have small gain?Gabriel Tham19 May 2019Nothing is guaranteed in investing with equities and bonds. These are not fixed deposits or singapore saving bonds. Even at conservative profile there will be volatility, the portfolio value will fluctuate."
