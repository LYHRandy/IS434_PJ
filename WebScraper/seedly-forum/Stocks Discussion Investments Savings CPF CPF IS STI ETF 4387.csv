I believe you are talking about your CPF Investment Scheme.To use your CPFIS-OA (Ordinary Account): Open a CPF Investment Account with DBS, OCBC or UOB
Generally, it doesn’t matter which bank you open your Investment Account with since the fees and charges are the same for all three.This account is purely to allow whichever bank you choose to administer the funds. You will still need a brokerage account to actually invest the money, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be with the same bank as your CPF Investment Account.For example, you can open a CPF Investment Account with DBS, and choose to buy a unit trust with PhillipCapital. PhillipCapital will liaise with DBS to execute the purchase.1 comment0"
