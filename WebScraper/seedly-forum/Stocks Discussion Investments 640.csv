question,"Stocks Discussion Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Aug 2019I understand that P/E ratio stands for - Company's share price to per-share earnings. But I do not understand how it works?E.g Apple Inc P/E ratio is 18.46 Meaning to say if I were to invest $1000 dollars,I would get back a profit of 1000/18.46 = 54.17? And if so, how is the profit then shared to you or given to you?Sorry if my question is weird as I am still new to stocks and currently reading up.3 answersAnswerBump2"

God of WisdomAnswered on 24 Aug 2019Price to earnings ratio is a measurement of valuing the company relative to the earnings per share. So if your PE ratio is 15, you'd expect that for every dollar invested, it will take 15 years for the company to make that dollar back. As the company makes money, they may decide at their discretion to retain the profit for future expansion, repay debt, or distribute part or all of it to you. If they distribute in the form of dividends, that would be the dividend yield. So a stock of P/E 15 with a yield of 4% would pay you your $1 invested over 25 years (1/0.04=25).0 comments4"

GeniusUpdated on 24 Aug 2019To calculate PEFind out what is the current price per share of the stock -- AFind out what is the earnings per share of the stock -- BPE = A / BHow to interpret PEIf the PE is 20, it means for every dollar earned by the company, an investor is willing to pay 20 dollars for that dollar of earnings. The higher the PE, it means that investors are willing to pay more for that dollar of earning. You may ask yourself, why would anyone pay 20 dollars for one dollar of earnings? You are paying for the potential of higher earnings in the future which would generally translate to stock price appreciation (capital growth).1 comment2"

4,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Aug 2019P/E ratio is also known as the price-earning ratio. Price here refers to the current price of the stock. To use the equation, multiply the current stock price by the total number of shares, divide by the earnings per share. The number indicates the amount a person has to invest in the company in order to receive one dollar of that companyâ€™s earnings.0 comments0"
