Here are some of the style - Income investing, value growth investing or growth investing. Different style required different type of analysis and invest in different type of companies. If you are those investors who require regualr income then income investing will make more sense to you. You can also choose to mix your portfolio with different style, for instance 70% income investing 30% growth. Secondly, if you choose income investing then you should looking at the consistent of the dividend and the dividend payout ratio follow by the type of business. Do avoid cyclical business as they are not income stocks. Lastly, For selling I only have 2 criteria, either the company's business fundamental change or super high valuation.0 comments0"
