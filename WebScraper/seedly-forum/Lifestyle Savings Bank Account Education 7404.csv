1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Hey there anon! Really agree with Shaun's input and wanted to add a little more:Food & Beverages: I really encourage meal prepping too, it helps you in budgeting & being healthier!! To minimise your grocery expenses, I recommend going to bulk stores (Go google Unpackt SG) & wet markets where items are more pocket friendly. Additionally, you should set a monthly (or weekly, whichever floats your boat) limit on the amount you can spend on F&B. I recommend you check out the following Seedly articles too: 1) Article for supermarkets' reward programmes that you can share with your family in order to stretch every dollar spent, 2) Article on closing time discounts you can get on different food items! It's such a steal when I manage to bag home the rotisserie's roast chicken (which I then use in my meal preps)!Entertainment: Again, set a limit on the amount you can spend every month in this area. Say no to jios when you've (unfortunately) spent beyond your limit. This drives me to save more for the following month to reward myself too. Promos & cashbacks: There're several channels on Telegram for you to learn about the various promos & deals in Singapore. If you haven't heard of cashbacks, do check out Shopback! It makes the burn in your wallet hurt a little less from earning back the cashbacks. For food expenditure, you can earn cashback via Shopback Go too.Track your expenses: Last but definitely not the least, you should consider downloading the Seedly App to track your monthly expenses and set those limits that I mentioned prior. Our Seedly App is very intuitive and user-friendly for everyone!!To wrap up, I wanted to say keep up the good work at planning your finances! Perhaps you would find this Seedly article on managing your personal finances relevant too (as a student, maybe you should focus on the first 3 pillars). Hope I helped :-)0 comments4"
2,"SWShaun Wq LimLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you are motivated and can work around your job schedules, see if meal prepping helps to reduce your food expenses in school. For me, I will pack lunch to work most weeks. Lunch is steamed vegetables usually. My lunch budget for the week is about $10-15 for the vegetables. The other costs are time to prepare and steam the vegetables every morning and electricity for the steamer.That said, this method doesn‚Äôt work if you blow the budget on your dinners or other expenses.Use cash for all your expenses. Have a fixed amount of cash as in your wallet per week, as your spending budget. If it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs gone. Go hungry or walk home as required.Designate one ‚Äúno spend on entertainment‚Äù day per week.Find free activities to do or stay at home to read.Open a separate savings account that is not readily accessible. No ATM card or online only account like CIMB FastSaver etc.Save and consolidate your savings every quarter to buy Singapore Savings Bonds.Out of sight, out of mind.3 comments4"
3,"See all 3 comments Pat05 Jun 2019First, open a CDP account online. Second, after it is approved, you can buy the monthly bonds through your I-banking platform (dbs, ocbc etc). The min is $500 and you have to pay $2 for your application. If you don't have that much savings or if you need quick access to your funds, maybe save a bit more before making a purchase of SSB.SWShaun Wq Lim05 Jun 2019Googling is a good start to search for Singapore blogs on investing. Seedly has good articles on starting on your investment journey too. As Patricia mentioned, you will need a CDP account to be open and application for SSB is via online banking. Min amount is $500 with a transaction cost of $2. Borrow a book title from the library called ‚ÄúThe Slight Edge‚Äù by Jeff Olsen and read to internalize the logic and concepts. It should be helpful when you follow the suggestions by the others too."

Track your expenses daily and don't spend more than you should. You can try putting that $200 into another bank account so you won't have easy access to it.0 comments3"
5,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I have only 1 advice which I took it myself when I was young1) Invest in yourself.Buy some books (Or borrow books from library, thats what I did because I don't know what books to buy and I am poor when I was a student)Read online for help, such as Money Mind of HWZ or Seedly.Learn some skills. Go take courses online such as Udemy or even those private courses (where the fees are high and many fake gurus around, but there are real gems)Treat some senior or experienced people coffee and tea for advice in life.Buy some small quantity of goods and start selling them to learn business skills.The biggest money maker is not bonds. not stocks. not alternative investments. not property.The biggest money maker is YOU.The sooner you realise this, the sooner you can build up this money maker and enjoy life sooner. ;)0 comments2"
6,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 05 Jun 2019Given that you get $500/600 working TWO jobs a month, I would have to say that you should earn more. There is a limit to how much you can save; earning more gives you unlimited upside.In addition to EARNing more, also look at opportunities that let you LEARN more. Because upgrading your skills at this age would lead to better paying job opportunities in the future.$150 a month for food is already pretty good - you probably can't go that much lower.If you can cut down on entertainment without affecting your sanity, it's worth considering too!With the savings, I would also start looking into investments. You could take a more active approach, or a more passive approach like robos, or even just putting it into a high Yield Savings account.0 comments2"
7,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 03 Jun 2019I think it's great that you use concession and place some savings into the bank.Some tips:Place the $200+ savings in a separate bank account starting from this month onwards. Ensure that this bank account discourages withdrawals e.g. hard to find ATM or fee charged for withdrawing. This helps to limit your expenditure.Consider cheaper alternatives for food, such as coffee shops or those $2.50 caifan meals for students by ntuc foodfare. Drink water instead of buying drinks! If you want to eat at fancy places, catch all the promos you can with Shopback Go and Eatigo ya~0 comments2"

9,Vincent Tan Wen BinLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I create my own system to save by using an account that I do not have access to (no atm). I automate my funds to be transferred into that account and do not spend anytime tracking it. This account value always grow since I do not touch it. But saving can only get you so far. The next step would be to try to increase the income. You mentioned that you are working 2 jobs getting $500/600 a month. How much time are you spending on that job? How much are they paying per hour? Are they paying you a good amount to start savings with? Why not look at those part time jobs that pays out comission on top of basic pay? That might help you to increase your income and gain valuable experience.0 comments1
10,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Boosting up Vincent Tan's answer.
If you are able to have two bank accounts, go for that. One bank account (A) is where your income goes, and no access to atm card. The other account (B) is your spending account and got atm card access. Make monthly transfer for your own budgeted allowance from the income account (A) to the spending account (B).Each time you run out of money in the spending account, you will have to transfer from income account to spending account.This method WORKS!! Why?
Everytime you withdraw money from the spending account and see the available balance, your eyes and brain will trigger ""pain"" and remind you how close you are to bursting your budget. The ""pain"" reminds you to cut down spending. This is rather SM though, but the ""pain"" reminds you to engage in behaviour that will promote ""survival"".Very raw, basic ""SM"". This is proven in psychology by the way.0 comments0"
11,"Einn HannLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 13 Jun 2019I used to always exceed on expenses too, I just can't reject new gadgets. In order to restrict myself to overspend, I start doing budgeting, for your case you can group them into 3 categories. E.g. Food - $180Transportation - $50Entertainment - $120 So, the leftover $150 you can save into your bank. However, your monthly expenses might not hit $350 every months, some will lesser some will more than. So, when this month you spend lesser, the remaining amount can be brought over to next month. Therefore, next month you can have more to spend.My way is remaining balance I would deposit back to saving. Because it is easily to take out when we need extra.

13,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Are your extra expenses on needs or wants? From there, you can cut down accordingly to fit your budget. Try setting aside your monthly savings in another bank account. In other words, have 2 banks accounts, 1 for your expenses (atm/debit card) and another for savings (e.g. CIMB Fastsaver).0 comments0"
