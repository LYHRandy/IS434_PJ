Your children will graduate and will step into the workforce where they must take care of themselves. You need to look at your situation now and ask yourself when you would like to retire, as well as your goals and dreams you would like to achieve in retirement.Firstly, ensure that you have a basic level of guaranteed income when you retire. CPF Life is one of the best annuities around and it gives a lifetime of income. As we do not know how long we live, a lifetime annuity forms the basis of 'survival income' to ensure that you will have money for essentials. You can also contribute to RA via top ups or with CPF monies to hit the enhanced retirement sum.Do note that this is a one way traffic however, money put into SA/RA will not be able to be withdrawn.Next, ensure you have medical and Long Term Care coverage. Medical and nursing bills can be quite hefty and we want to ensure that such bills do not drain us of money for retirement. Beyond Medishield life and Eldershield, look at getting an integrated shield plan as well as Eldershield enhancement.Once those are taken care of, we can look beyond the basics. Creating lasting income from both guaranteed and variable sources will ensure diversification across various asset classes (retirement plan, equities, fixed income, etc) and a stable, low volatility portfolio. The exact composition of such a portfolio is dependent on your risk appetite and preferences, so discuss with a consultant who can help you to plan and allocate your limited resources accordingly. If you'd like, I can show you the strategies we use to plan for clients including strategies to hedge inflation and longevity through your retirement years.0 comments4"

1) please check that you have medical insurance
2) calculate how much you need for retirement (based on the lifestyle you want)
3) calculate how much you're getting from your current assets and cpf
4) take the difference between 2) and 3) to identify the shortfall/ surplusIf there's no shortfall, congrats! If there is then you can either adjust your expectations for retirement or to decide on doing some investments or earn some side income.If you're not healthy, you can skip step 1 above. If you like an example for me to illustrate what I've shared, please let me know in the comments! :)0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 17 Jul 2019Hi,In my opinion, there are few bases you need to cover first:Medical insurance (hospitalization, accident, long term care, etc.) clarify with cpf your payout level and available withdrawal amountLegacy planning for your family, via assets or insurance or both. (will formation and communicating your plans) After you've done those, you could diversify to receive regular payouts or intensify into a business or endeavour you are passionate about. Remember to ensure sufficient funds for your base. Some alternative options to managed funds, annuities, endowments and its equivalent include but not limited to;fixed deposits in MYR for 3 - 4%masternodes for 5 - 8% yield, potential capital appreciation crowdfunding 9 - 12%From experience, my personal take is to sit with 50% cash and wait for the great financial sale to happen. 
These are my opinions and not to be taken as financial advice.0 comments0"
