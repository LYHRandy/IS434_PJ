1,"Luke Ho, Venture Capitalist at CFXLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Sep 2018The answer is absolutely. But honestly, there are a lot of considerations. Here are two of the most pressing ones - ​1) Illiquidity: Plans from these companies often require you to commit a number of years without withdrawing.2) Fees: The wrapper can be high, as can the cost of the actively managed funds.​That being said, the pros for this are​1) Great selection of MAS approved funds with often the highest ratings.2) Lots of cash bonuses ​Being an investment specialist who made 32.7% in last year's market return, which was over double digits higher than the Singapore and US markets, I'd say that these plans are really only worth it if you're looking for either fixed income or aggressive investments.​Fixed income funds are far more efficient in yield and lowered risk than ETFs e.g. Bond ETFs, or other dividend yielding instruments like REITs. Similarly, emerging market funds make a lot more money than emerging market ETFs. And one look at the MSCI Index will show you that the Emerging Market ETFs make a lot more money than the Global Index, with a higher Sharpe Ratio as well (more return for less risk). This is all nett of fees, which is why across time I make a lot more money than people in the majority. ​It's just statistical fact. ​Of course, you need a lot of time and the correct risk profile to run out the volatility, and many other factors like that. What a lot of insurance agents do is get greedy and add nonsense to the investment plan consisting of all sorts of excess insurance. Which isn't necessary.

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018For typical insurance such as term life and personal accident, I would say that it isn't a form of investment but rather, a protection for yourself and family should any unfortunate incident were to happen. However if you're referring to endowment plans, then I guess you can consider it as a form of investment0 comments0"
3,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018most investment linked policy does not provide good returns so in my view I would say no.​it would be better to buy insurance for risk mitigation and focus on your own set of investment. ​Unless you are refering to endowment aka savings plans. Then yes that would be part of your investment bucket but personally I do not like savings plans due to low returns. 0 comments0"

Think of different roles in an RPG. Your financial plan is like a team.
Insurance - Healer
Tank - Bonds / Fixed Deposit
Fighter - Fixed income with Equities
Assassin/Marksmen - Equities only and higher risk
They all play different role in your financial plan. Some are aggressive in getting returns (but also suffer huge damage if overpowered)
While some does nothing much, but supports the planSo insurance provide the support that in the event any of the guys got killed, it resets by healing / resurrecting to a base portfolio. But it's damage ability (ROI) is super low.An investment plan with insurers is like a Mixed class with elements of healer and maybe fighter or assassin. But trade off is it's (premium), required you to purchase and the stats may, or may not be better than a pure build.
It depends on how it is customised, and hence required more knowledge on your FA to make it a good customised hero0 comments0"
5,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018No, it is more for protection rather than for investment. Insurance is more of an income replacement if one were to lose the ability to generate income. 0 comments0"
6,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018What do you hope to achieve from this investment? It's not a good idea to use retail products offered by insurers for investment. Why? Because it is very expensive to get to your financial goal. Say you want to accumulate a figure of $1 million for your retirement. Try asking an agent to show you how much premium you will need and how long it will take before this can be achieved. Best way is to DIY your own portfolio, or pay to attend a course if you do not know how. It'll be an investment on yourself and for your future. I used to think like you, that using products from insurers is the only way to prepare for my future (and retirement). But after I started attending  courses on trading and investing, I moved on to create my own portfolio generating >30% returns a year. And this will be my engine for retirement, or to allow me to fire my boss, in the next 3 years or so. 0 comments0"
