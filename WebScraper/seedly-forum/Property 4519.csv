WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2018If s/1 die w/o will, his spouse , children, siblings, parents, grandparents, uncle/auntie will get the property. If no one at all , government takes all.  ​I doubt there's anyone don't have the above because you definitely live long enough to have relatives or someone in order to have assets of your own. Thus it won't come to the end where goverment takes all. Therefore,  maybe you have better luck to go check out auction house for banks where properties were being confiscated for whatever reason to look for actions of properties. ​Ref: https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/in-the-absence-of-a-will-how-is-the-deceased-estate-distributed/​Interstate succession act: https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/ISA19670 comments0"
