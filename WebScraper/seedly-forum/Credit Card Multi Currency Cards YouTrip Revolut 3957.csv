1,"Joseph GohLevel 2. RookieAnswered 3w agoI have been using Revolut since 2014 before it rolled out the premium features and offerings. It started off as a multi-currency card for travellers and slowly leaning more towards the digital banking side while you can set up a scheduled payment monthly and act as sort of spending management purpose since it offers a monthly spending visuals for you across different currency.
They actually started offering free commission stock trading to the current customers as well. Other services including insurance and concierge services if you're a premium customer paying a monthly fee.At the moment, the use case for YouTrip seems more restricted to frequent travellers while you can treat Revolut as some sort of money tracking app/ stock broking app.
And Revolut actually supports Apple or Google Pay! Regrading the conversion rate, I think it depends on the time you check. Might need to do a further study to make a better comparison on the spot rates.Also, YouTrip doesn't allow you to use its card to withdraw from SG local ATMs but Revolut does with a withdrawal limit of around 200GBP per month I believe. (I got mine back in the UK so the denominated currency is in GBP)Just my personal opinion as a user of both services. Hope it helps!1 comment1"

Revolut has 0.5% if you convert fx above $9k a month. YouTrip doesn't have this cap but I guess $9k limit is more than enough for most of us.

Generally I prefer Revolut user interface and it has nicer card color. I use both"
