1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018I focus first on mandatory payments - for me, these were my telco bill, parents allowance, public transport, and study loan repayment.Then I calculate how much that takes up, and move on to other expenses that are necessary but where I can find ways to cut down on eg. food. Once that's left, I save everything else. I didn't implement the different money jars system until my income increased, because my first paycheck was too low to portion it out that way yet.Another alternative (if you're bent on implementing the money jars system) would be to focus on the second step and divide it into 3 equal parts, so your savings go into holiday, investments, and emergency funds.It also depends on your priorities though. If you're more towards enjoying yourself and going for a holiday over investing for your future, then you could allocate more to that. So you should first ask yourself what you want and then allocate from there :)0 comments3"
