question,"Bank Account Savings Fixed Deposits Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoIs the ICBC Fixed Deposit worth going for?Say if I only have $500 currently and I am not going to use it anytime now, will it be worth placing it into ICBC Fixed Deposit? It says that $500 is the minimum. Additionally, (noob question), on its site, suppose I go for a 3 months tenor which will give me 1.70%, and during these course of 3 months, I have deposited in additional $800, will the calculation be ($5000.0175 + $8000.0035)?And lastly, is this account worth going for?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2w agoHello!I don't think it is worth going for as you might need the $500 during the 3 months tenor, unless this is $500 excess of your emergency funds. Also, ICBC is not the friendliest bank to deal with and on that note, I say don't go for it. If you are below 27, why not open a Stan Chart JumpStarter account for 2% with no min balance or withdrawal penalties? Think that is a pretty solid deal :)0 comments0"
