1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Nov 2018Dropshipping is pretty viable and doesn't require much effort/time, excluding the initial set up. Used to do it previously and could earn about $500-600 per month without much effort while I was studying in Poly.

3,"Cherie Tan04 Apr 2019Hi! Great to see youâ€™re willing and open to earning more income by taking up a second job. I hear tutoring is a great way to both have work life balance and earn a stable stream of side income. Try something like www.A1TuitionAcademy.com, my friends work as tutors with this agency! So far, so good."

MasterAnswered on 19 Nov 2018There's soo many you can do: https://seedly.sg/questions/what-are-the-different-ways-of-producing-passive-income-available-in-singapore (the list is not exhaustive). But whether to find a job that pays more depends on your cost-benefit anaylsis. Is the extra work load worth the X amount? Is there more satisfaction with your new job? 0 comments0
7,"Steven LeeLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 03 Jul 2019There is a good opportunity is to consider
there is a company marketing  using DNA technology to help people to improve wellness and lifestyle.  It is innovative idea first of its kind. Sort of pioneer in its kind of business.
You can earn side income through introduce friends to join as members.  No selling is needed.  Just introduce FriendS and people to this scheme   More u introduce more u earn.
Some me call this MLM but understand they have cleared and gotten SG govt approval for this business  which meet the criteria of eligibility
the catch is u also need to sign up a member and pay a initial token fee. $200-300 which include a free DNA test plus analysis. And also need to pay monthly subscription fee of less than $100.   Understand you  recover this cost easily once u introduce 3-4 friends  and earning Will escalate and multiply over  time
if keen   Can message me4 comments0"
