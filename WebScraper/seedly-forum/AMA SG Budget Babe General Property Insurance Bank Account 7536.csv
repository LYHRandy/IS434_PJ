ProdigyAnswered on 26 Oct 2018Explain that Wills are not for the deceased but for the living.Would they wish that which your heart is broken, at the same time you have to fight off sharks and companies trying to get a share?Consider maybe your parents wanted a simple funeral, but someone who thinks they know better will fight you tooth and nails. All because of no instructions on the form of a simple Will.You should be able to think of something that will make sense to your parents using this template.If no Will, if you wish for XYZ, you may not get it because of ABC will insist otherwise.Better still, now there's the free will writing online? Check it out and let us know.0 comments0"
