1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Nov 2018First, find out about 1M65 and how the strategy works.  I think everyone should try to build up a strong financial safety net first with their CPF SA / MA account. Once you do that, then your retirement is kind of secured.  You might then want to save your money to wait for a investment opportunity. It is common sense that how one makes money in stock market: Buy Low , Sell High. But few have the financial guts to do it Probably your financial guts would be stronger to stomach invetment in market crashes if you have 1M65 mapped out.  Traditional stock market experts encourage a dollar averaging investment method.  I find it more rewarding to simply wait for market to crash badly and I would jump in and invest.  Note: You might not invest well if your financial guts is not trained to do it - i.e. if you dont have a strong financail safety net of a 1M65.0 comments4"

RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Danial,If you save $300 per month, this is = $3600 a year.*assuming you intend to have 1mil at retirement age of 65, you will have roughly 44 years to achieve this amount. Using financial calculator, to achieve 1mil (yearly $3600 saving, over 44 years), your yearly investment returns must be about 7%. *ofcoz this simple calculation excludes the reality of inflation and hence the purchasing power of your retirement money can be lower than what you expected. But this is much better than not setting aside for retirement.Out of SSB(2+%), CPF (5%), ETF (3+%, depending on which year you started), the closest to this CPF ( *Your CPF savings in the Ordinary Account (OA) earn guaranteed interest rates of 2.5% per year, while savings in the SA, MediSave Account and RA currently earn interest rates of 4% per year. The first $60,000 of your combined CPF balances, of which up to $20,000 comes from your OA, earn an additional 1% interest per year) . 2 comments1"
3,"Leong Wen Fong15 Nov 2018Good advice, but the last paragraph won't add up to 7% returns in total would it!Chong Learn Khang30 Nov 2018Yes @Leong :) you are right. Those don’t add up to 7% like you have mentioned. For those normal investment vehicles suggested, may not be sufficient for @daniel to achieve 1million at retirement age. Cpf is only one option “closer” to 7% returns. Ofcoz in the market, there are a lot investment that potentially higher returns (ofcoz riskier as well.) For young investor reading this post, I do suggest to talk more to those experienced investors and start young :) you have time advantage. Cheers and all the best "
