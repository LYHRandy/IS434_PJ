1,"Ashley Wong, Financial Assistant at Multi Management & Future SolutionsLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 09 May 2019Both have their own importance. If you are planning to trade for a short term, technical analysis is a more preferred technique. For long term stock trading, fundamental analysis is a way to go.  However, technical analysis can also be a beneficial tool to analyze long-term investments when combined with fundamental analysis. As a trader, it is best to learn both these fundamental and technical analysis skills. 0 comments0"
