1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 17 Sep 2018When do i start: Just 2017. What triggered: Need $, need to plan for future, retirements etc. ​I think the key is that , after all attempt, you'll realize that no matter no many what professional one may be in, working for people is not going to get us anywhere because:​We earn a limited salary.We have people or ownself unlimited cost requirements affected by external factors such as a roof over your head, food on the table, basic needs of protections in case of sick and take care of parents / family / love one etc. We realize that the basic need in the the world is only going to be more and more expensive only and that we're no longer invisible that for everything, and one day we'll be old and unable to work. There's a limit for everyone such that we have limited knowledge (there's always someone smarter than ourselves) and there's limited time and resources.  We should leverage on other's expertise or learn from others to always do better to be prepare for future. ​I used to think financial and trading is very hard and not for me. But i realize no matter how hard / difficult trading or financial seems, it is managable if we try to understand and learn it. There's other ways to go about getting financially ready but the most suitable path now is to learn and manage own financial as young and as early as possible since our world is made up of numbers and all things uses fiat ($) as comodity of exchange. Thus want to or don't want to, hard or not hard. Just dive in and learn since there no easier / better ways than to manage own financial. ​One thing i learned, Just like any other knowledge, if we apply ourselves, we can at least learn and the more we apply, the more we can master it. ​Hope you have a great journey investing , managing financial too :) ​0 comments2"
2,"Lucas Ong, GreenBoii at GreenBoiisSGLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I started having interest in Mathematics when I saw my father calculate the probability of winning 4D and TOTO when I was in Primary school. After watching ""God of Gamblers"", I wanted to be like the rich men, throwing money around at casinos as I wished, only difference is that I would be able to take calculated risks to ""outsmart"" the house. This led to me being interested in the concepts of money and risk-taking.Fast forward to after getting my O' Level results. Part of me wanted to become an investment banker so as to feel the excitement and power I have while I handle portfolios worth millions and billions of dollars. The other part of me just wanted to learn more about investments and the finance industry just to further educate myself.After graduating with a Diploma in Banking & Finance and currently serving the nation, I'm starting to put what I know into concrete actions - managing my own finance, reading up on companies and news to make smart investments, etc. While it's tough to do too many things with my $560 allowance, I see it as good practice to be able to learn how to spend within one's own means and start to be financially independent.3 comments1"

5,Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Started investing after reading on financial blogs that there are better alternatives to grow my money instead of leaving it in the bank to earn that small amount of interest which can't even keep up with the inflation rate. Thus wanted to make my money work for me and grow it faster within the same time period 0 comments0

7,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018I was brought to a Adam Khoo preview session by a friend. Which sparked my interest and then started reading on financial blogs, moneysmart and books. But I didn't implement it right away. Probably 5/6months later. As previously before the preview session, I was constantly out of cash, borrowing money from friends, didn't had a goal in life yet. After the session I decided to read more about it and then subsequently invested. 0 comments0"

10,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2018Started way back about 10 years ago now, buying into a ILP plan for myself when I was an agent. In hindsight, it's not really the brightest move due to the many fees involved. From there, learned more about finance and investments to start planning for retirement. Made many mistakes, lose some money, but still spurred on. Now am determined to fire my boss within the next 3 to 5 years, thanks to my portfolio which was built 2 years ago.0 comments0"
