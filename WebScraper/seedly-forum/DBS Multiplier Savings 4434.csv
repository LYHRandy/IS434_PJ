Most likely if only you have DBS credit card, only your DBS multiplier will get the additional interest. Both of you can just apply for 1 credit card and spend $1 if you don't like to use the credit card which will make both of your DBS Multiplier accounts be eligible for card spending category. You can also do the SSB ladder and set the joint account as the CDP dividends account which will give another investment category for both Multiplier account.SSB Ladder -  https://kpo-and-czm.blogspot.com/2018/04/dbs-multiplier-ssbs-joint-account-higher-interest.html Change CDP dividends account -  https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-with-ease/direct-crediting-service0 comments0"
