MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2019Even if you wish to get cash advance, please take note of the following:(1) Interest Rate, and Effective Interest Rate.I can give you a 0% interest, but for every $12,000 you borrow, I charge you $600 for fees.Is this really 0% interest then? OR is it $12,600 instead?Also, If I have to repay the loan at $1,050.00 per month, is it really only 5% fees? Or more than that?Think about it.0 comments0"
