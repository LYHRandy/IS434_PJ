It’s ultimately your money 37% of your income (capped at 2220) goes into it every month! It’s an asset that many Singaporeans have not fully utilised!0 comments4"

Same way a WL death benefit is also part of your networth as it's an asset. Just unrealised gain. It's part of your networth that you may not see in total unless you outlive the national life expectancy age but it's your money and also your dependents money in the future.0 comments0"
