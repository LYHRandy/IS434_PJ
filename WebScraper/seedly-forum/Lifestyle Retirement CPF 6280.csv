WonderkidAnswered on 12 Jan 2019This is interesting, co-incidentally I have shared this hack in hwz forum yesterday.I believe the reasons people ignoring this “hack” are:1) They prefer to YOLO first than delay gratification, after all the money will be locked for 25-30 years before it becomes a meaningful sum to be withdrawed (assuming you renounce citizenship). However, it is always too late when they realise that it is time to top up cpf, then they start to complain govt for not helping the poor, the rest are history.2) They are afraid of govt will change the policy and ban lump sum withdrawa even you renounce citizenshi?3) They are confident that they can beat the cpf guaranteed interest by investing themselves. While I do not deny that there is a small group of investors who has no problem generating better returns from investment, one must be clear about the difference of risk levels between cpf and investment. Many simply ignore the risk taken, while criticising that the biggest risk is govt (conspiracy theory yeah).What makes me wonder is that they rather “save” in structured note or endowment plan (not saying these are not good), than trusting the bond with AAA rating.0 comments1"
