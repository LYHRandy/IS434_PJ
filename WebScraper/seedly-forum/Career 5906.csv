1,"Eveline LauLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 25 Nov 2018Always ask the HR when is the latest you should be responding to the offer. If you’re interested in this company, it is unlikely that you’ll look away from it. And since you’re willing to consider another company’s offer, which is currently still an imaginary, you might not be suitable for this company? Because you’re just looking out for “who can offer me the best”. Even if you pick up this offer now, soon you’ll choose to leave because you’re not thinking of the intangible gains from the company and not even what you can contribute to the company.0 comments1"

4,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 25 Nov 2018No fixed answer. Depends on the company, industry norms and how urgently they need the manpower. You night be able to stretch it a bit longer if u can come up with a viable reason, eg doing community work that requires your commitment for X months. However, if they need u urgently for an upcoming project, u cant drag it that long.Do consider whether u may want to work for the company in the future even if u receive a better offer, in which case better be careful not to accept and then resign immediately if u get a better offee.0 comments0"
