question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Oct 2018My parents bought Prushield, a premier policy for me, which covers private hospitals. But they said that if I ever get hospitalised, they'll put me in a public one. Should I downgrade the policy?Are there any advantages to keeping the policy if I don't stay in a private hospital? Should I keep the policy first and downgrade when I'm older and the premiums rise? I told my parents that they're overpaying and asked them to speak to their FA but they never find the time to do so.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 29 Nov 2018Buy what you need. As long as you are employed and could afford the premium, you may want to be covered for private hospital. However, if you are unemployed and could not afford the premium, it would be better to downgrade to public hospital.  There is no right or wrong answers. It really depends on your needs and whether you could afford.0 comments0"
2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Advantages is you get cashback if you stay in A ward. Overpaying depends on the treatment you need ba. Also, it's easier to Downgrade, than to upgrade. I would rather get the best now (since my working years is so important), and downgrade once I do not need that super fast response for medical attention. 2 comments0"
3,"Question Poster24 Oct 2018Does this mean that if I go to public hospital and go to A ward, I will be covered?Loh Tat Tian24 Oct 2018Private Hospital Insurance cover more than public. So if you bought a private hospital insurance, public hospital coverage is full too.

Ceveat though (i have assumed you paid cash rider, let me know if you did not upgrade to PruShield extra A, as this rider is the cashback option of $75/$50 if you stay in public hospital ward.)"
