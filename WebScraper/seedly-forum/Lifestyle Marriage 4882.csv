It needs to be meaningful.If however she is in fact looking for it to be ultra expensive/extravagant, then I guess you would also need to think about whether values about money are aligned.0 comments1"

5,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Oct 2018Pls try to find out your gf's ideal proposal and her thoughts well enough before action.  While most gals always touched to tears on videos of public proposal, I have gfs telling me they do NOT look forward to such proposal as it is too attention seeking and it is more like peer pressure that they should agree to it.​Find a place which is meaningful for both of you, e.g. the venue you first met or first date. Other places will be at the chalet, gathering family and friends to plan for the surprise or a surprise proposal during an overseas trip. ​If your gf is someone who love little surprise, can do up a scrapbook album, compiling photos of your dating journey and journal down your thoughts towards her and your vision for future.0 comments0"

Just the 2 of you and ask the venue operators for small favour to help make it special without spending $.0 comments0"
