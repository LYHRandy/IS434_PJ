question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Dec 2018How do I deal with unreasonable superiors?Basically, I got scolded for not answering my mobile phone as it was charging and in silent mode on another table. The female Warrant Officer then said what if someone is passing away and needed to call me urgently, then how? I couldn't be bothered to reply/rebut as I don't want to risk getting charged or having to sign extra. Anyway if that's the case, shouldn't all trainees be allowed to carry their phone with them at all times? Simply unreasonable!3 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 18 Dec 2018Haha because of their abosolute power in rank, some of them just treat whatever they are saying as law, and not think about how it may or may not make sense.You will always have your fair share of unreasonable superiors. Just move on, any way, you won't be there for so long!0 comments1"

3,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Dec 2018Just apologise and move on. Especially if you do not need to deal with them. But if you have to and is stuck with them,The other method I can recommend is to make them happy or at least not offend them. Meditate and claim yourself also to prevent further damage etc (which you have done).You cannot control their actions, but you can control your response to them (by not giving them a chance to be nasty). 0 comments0"
