1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Jul 2018Don't limit yourself. And be creative. Very often in Singapore, people start to shut their minds because they think they don't have the right qualifications. Everyone starts from somewhere and no one is too early or too late.​Seriously hustle your way and work for less, show that you are hungry. Then this will kick in:​""Be so good that you can't be ignored"" Or difficult to replace. ​Be it a chef, delivery driver, admin staff, counter waiter/waitress... I always believe with the right attitude, people will recognise you.​And overtime, upgrade yourself with the necessary skillsets and qualifications to do better in life. Keep going. Your mind is your best qualification.0 comments5"

3,"Abhilasha SinghLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 30 Jul 2018I am glad you asked this question because there are many people out there who think that they have limited qualification. There is no technical answer to this, all I can say is that_ Faith _is the key word here and that you should always have in yourself. ​Everyone starts from the scratch. In today’s generation knowledge is more valuable than your degree or even masters. Companies want to hire who has good qualities and personalities and not based on how many degree do they have. ​In Singapore many people think they do not have the right qualifications but that should not be the case. When you go for an interview show them how passionate about you are regarding that job and you inner personality, I am sure you will crack the interview and will get promoted soon with your skill set. With the right attitude and optimism you can reach high level and earn good.​Once you achieve that you will have the option to upgrade your qualifications and you can add more value to your skill set. ​Keep exploring yourself! You can do wonders!! 0 comments2"

As others have mentioned,  money can be found as long you're willing to get down and dirty. I think it's really important to explore and see what truly sparks your interest - don't let a lack of ""qualifications"" hold you back!​I'd also like to refer you to this reddit article, you might find it helpful.
