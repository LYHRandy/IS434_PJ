In Singapore properties are getting expensive and expensive day by day, because we have a shortage of land.

If it is paid up in full, the rental collected is passive income which can be put towards other investments. If mortgage is still being serviced, then we need to work through the numbers to see if makes sense to hold on to it or liquidate it.2) What are your parents plans in the next 5-10 years? While there may not be an immediate use for the proceeds from selling the property, your parents need to be more forward thinking when talking about ""investing"" the excess cash, simply because when you talk about investing, there is always a minimum timeframe that the money should be left untouched.0 comments0"

Will you be able to find any other investments to generate returns on this excess cash and without losing this pot of gold?Rental collection is good long term income, once the mortage is all paid.Need to buy another property to stay? Or downgrade? If so, then must consider now property price going up, buying another property to stay may not be so cheap.​​0 comments0"
