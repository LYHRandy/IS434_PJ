SGX everything also query, move abit only query.One must understand that the markets will have winners and losers. SG tries very hard to protect people from losing. So many query, trading halt and investors only like yields and REITs.Look at HK markets, alot more HUGE scandals but there is more vibrancy in volume and trading. Because people need to feel they can win big and on the other end sadly someone will lose big too. In SG, just 1 hyflux loss and then all go Hong Lim to protest and make noise.0 comments1"
