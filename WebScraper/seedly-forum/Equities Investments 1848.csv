1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 03 Apr 2019While concessions on trade have been made by most side (read: China), there are some issues that have yet to be resolved. These issues may still be an area of contention in the broader scheme of things and can potentially sour ties between US and China1) Intellectual PropertyUS accuses China of infringing on American intellectual property such as through counterfeiting famous brands and stealing trade secrets to pressuring companies to share technology with local companies to gain access to Chinaâ€™s vast market.2) Enforcement of Trade DealUS demands that it retain the power to police the execution of the deal, and wants the power to impose unilateral tariffs on China if it fails to abide by deal; However, China strongly opposes this.Clearly, initial attempts of diplomatic overtures have been put in place, but I think more needs to be done to address these sticking points to ensure that the worst is truly over for the trade war.0 comments2"
