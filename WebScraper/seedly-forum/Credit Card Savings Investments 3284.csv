God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Oct 2018Hey Anon, you should probably have a discussion with an IFA to do some full financial planning. ​Your needs are specific but possibly complicated. ​Of course the generic advice would be to max out your CPF VC and SRS contributions yearly. You should also probably look to invest your CPF and/or SRS monies after that.​Your obectives need to bet clearly defined. Is it for capital preservation, legacy transfer, growth, income, etc?​Also an IFA can also provide you with a managed portfolio like the ones offered by the Robos like Autowealth and Stashaway.0 comments0"
