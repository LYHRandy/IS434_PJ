God of WisdomAnswered on 23 Oct 2018SRS is a tax deferred scheme that allows you to save on your tax by deducting your contributions from your taxable income but it is semi locked in till age 62. Any withdrawals is taxable 100% and you must pay a penalty of 5%.You should look at it once you start climbing the income brackets and want to lower it back down to save on tax.The monies in SRS can also be invested and used to purchase financial products.0 comments1"
