1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019This is a good idea :)  To hit your min spend.â€‹In fact, the best hack around GrabPay is to use it at all the merchants which accept it to collect points. (and of course, needless to say when you actually take grab rides)â€‹To me, I also collected over 15,000 GrabRewards points and have redeemed close to $60 worth of GRAB vouchers with these points for my rides. So I guess that's a hack? â€‹Quite easy to use also when I dont carry cash around alot every where nowadays.2 comments11"

WizardAnswered on 29 Aug 2018There's a variety of ""hacks"" to hit the min card spend:â€‹Grabpay top up $20 sometimes when there's deal on their page. Use cardup.co tie with my credit card and use it to pay a variety such as Rent, Season parking, car / education loan, insurance, income tax, property tax, condo fee. This will help you hit $500 and more already. Just make sure you card yields cash back more than 2.6% cash back or more points worth. (Due to card up levied 2.6% fee) When go restaurant or even Hawker, check if any Favepay pink logo, use it to pay for food / services / purchase since it will charge to your credit card. Top up Beepay if you use honestbee since their food delivery  is still ony $1 (promotional period) and no concierge fee.â€‹Finally, all that Charmaine shared below especially use paywave function on your credit card for all food / expenses / purchase on everyday shop / supermarket and consolidate all your bills into this same card. â€‹Happy Spending! :) hahahaha0 comments8"

If your sole purpose is just to hit the credit card minimum of $600, why don't you consider to diversify your ""portfolio""?â€‹I am a frequent grab user and their recent change in the reward system makes me feel that they would tilt the system in their favor when the time comes so I'm not playing their point system much now.â€‹I would suggest you to look at what are some of the expenses you have now. Are you dining outside with cold hard cash now? Consider using paywave at toastbox/bread talk/food republic etc. If you frequently but bread, use your card and get the buns package card at bread talk or the drinks package at toastbox. Get all your subscriptions onto the cards. Pay your phone bills, with these credit cards.â€‹If you frequently grab it should not be a problem for you to top up the remaining and use it up at grabpay merchants or when you grab.. but if there's still a gap and you do use home delivery for food, groceries and laundry consider using honestbee. They have beepay which you can top up and utilize later too.â€‹Hope this helps!â€‹2 comments6"
