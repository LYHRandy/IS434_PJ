1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 22 Aug 2019Yeah I am just referring to the reviews here posted on Seedly: https://seedly.sg/reviews/investment-courses/dr-tee-ein55""Promised use of free software which he claims he developed himself, but he did not say it was free only for the duration of the course. After the course you have to pay to subscribe or pay to attend higher level courses.  Claims to have developed many different ""styles"" of investing, but in actual fact, it is just giving his own name to what is already available in public.  Throughout the 5 days, more than half the time he talks about some other stories, and upselling his other courses. Not much time is dedicated to real teaching. And after the 5 days, you will often receive emails from him promoting other investment ""courses"".  Recommend to avoid, unless you have spare cash ($1000) to throw and don't mind listening to an old man boasting about himself. ""1 comment0"
2,Question Poster22 Aug 2019I was told he changes the investment duration of his charts to show that his method is profitable. Was hoping that someone can share some light on it.
