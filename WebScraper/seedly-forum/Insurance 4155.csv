1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey there! Yup I would highly recommend this. As a rider to the term life that you already probably have with the SAF Group term.​When I was doing my research with them, I found that this was a good CI and ECI plan to use as my coverage for affordability. In fact this is what I am currently on as well.​​​​You can find out more here: https://blog.seedly.sg/should-you-cancel-your-aviva-mindefmha-group-insurance-after-you-ord/2 comments2"
2,"Teo Liang Wei19 Jul 2018Would the premiums down the road be more expensive as compared to buying a term plan with a fixed priceLoh Tat Tian30 Nov 2018I have did a calculation on the total premiums (for living care, levelled) and it roughly translates to $706/annum for a coverage of $300k. Do you think it is expensive? and most of the premiums are required during the 50s etc. So you are saving a lot now, and paying up later."
