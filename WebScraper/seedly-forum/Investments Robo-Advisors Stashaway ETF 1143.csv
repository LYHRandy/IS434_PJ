If you are looking to enhance the growth element of your portfolio, you can consider investing into US or China/APAC, check out the following ETFs for broad market coverage;Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) - NYSEiShares Core MSCI AC Asia ex Japan Index ETF (3010.HK) - HKEXVanguard Total China Index ETF (3169.HK) - HKEXRecommended Brokerage : Interactive BrokerCheck out Shiny Things Thread on HardwarezoneNot sure what is your risk index in Stashaway, assuming it is the most aggresive (with the least of bond allocation), you can look at Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, for some bond allocation. I like this particular ETF becasue it is not overly conservative and it should provide some decent yield spread over Singapore treasauries.0 comments1"
