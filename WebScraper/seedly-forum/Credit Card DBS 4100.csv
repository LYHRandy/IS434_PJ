1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 24 Jun 2019The most straighforward way would be to check with DBS to see why it was rejected.
Based on the data points you provided, it might be the case that they want to see a full 12 months of income, and you are just shy of a month.2 comments2"
2,"Question Poster24 Jun 2019Yea i called and emailed them but they say for cc rejections they are unable to disclose the reason for the decline :/ they mentioned that it was like an internal thing which they do not disclose to us hmm. Yea i was thinking of waiting for my July pay to be in before trying to apply again as there will be a small increment hahahJunus Eu24 Jun 2019Yes, and perhaps wait a little longer if you can. On the side, no harm sussing out the credit card promoters and casually ask! They won't be able to tell you specifically for your case, but I'm sure in their line they do see the common reasons for rejected applications."

Last time there was this rumour of POSB Everyday Card requiring 24 months or 2 full years of CPF contributions at the point of card application.Donâ€™t think DBS is that strict now for such T&Cs. Just try reapplying for the DBS Credit Card again, make sure your CPF contribution is at a constant monthly rate first.0 comments0"
4,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Yes, you can keep applying for the DBS cc. Salary 2350 with 13 month will qualify for most cc. Perhaps, if you see a roadshow and the same cc have promo, you can try at the roadshow.1 comment0"
5,Question Poster24 Jun 2019Ahh i see im tryna apply for the DBS Altitude card :/ i have tried googling for roadshows but couldnt find a site that states all the roadshows! Is there a specific forum or somewhere where keeps track of them?
6,"Huang Yixuan, Product Designer at SomewhereLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 25 Jun 2019Hmm the first time I applied for my DBS Live Fresh was also similar situation to you, only received 2 weeks pro rated pay. They rejected initially but it was because I need to show a staff card or something, but my company doesn't have a staff card. So I just sound it up to them and in the end they expedited my issue and approved my card. You can try asking on social media haha.4 comments0"
7,"See all 4 comments Question Poster24 Jun 2019Ahh i see alright hahah! Just to confirm, did you send your employment contract and staff card via online application or did you go down to the branch? :)Huang Yixuan25 Jun 2019I sent my employment contract initially. Then they say they need staff card, but I don't have so I called them. And then they settle for me after a long period of back and forth, but no I didn't have to go down the branch, all done over phone and email!"
8,Maxwell TanLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Have you tried to check if you have met the minimum criteria for applications? Like minimum earning per annum etc.1 comment0
9,"Question Poster24 Jun 2019Yea the minimum was 30,000 pa so if including 13 month bonus then its just above it hahaha"
10,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Did you check with DBS why the application was rejected?If DBS did not request to review your credit report, it might be due to the following reasons (assuming that you have a good credit score)
a) application may be incomplete or incorrect
b) income requirements for the card not met.I think you should call the bank and check with them the reason for the rejection first before you apply again.1 comment0"
