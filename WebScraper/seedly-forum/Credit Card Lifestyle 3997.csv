1,"DanielLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 04 Sep 2019“Best miles card of 2019” depends very much on your spending pattern. This is because not all cards are created equal. Each has its own pros and cons.For example, do you do a lot of online shopping? (DBS Women World Mastercard, Citi Rewards)
Do you travel overseas frequently? (UOB Visa Signature)
Do you find yourself using PayWave often? (UOB Preferred Platinum Visa, UOB Visa Signature)
Or do you mostly spend on dining out? (UOB Krisflyer, Maybank Horizon, HSBC Revolution)In terms of general spending miles card, currently, the highest mile per dollar (mpd) offered is 1.5 mpd (local) and 3.0 mpd (overseas) by BOC Elite Miles World Mastercard. 
The recently launched OCBC 90N has a promotional overseas spending rate at 4.0 mpd till the end of February 2020, you might want to take a look if you have an overseas trip soon.Lastly, don’t just look at the headline rates that the banks put up. Check about the benefits that banks offer (eg. Lounge access). Do a bit of research through reviews and terms & conditions of each card before you plan to sign up.1 comment1"

You also have to look at which airlines you would like to credit your miles/points to,
OCBC 90N sounds great for getting miles for the time being because it’s new.. however... it has only one airline partner, which is KrisFlyer(for SQ, SilkAir and Scoot if I’m not wrong). If that is what you want to fly, it would be good. 

And 90N doesn’t have free lounge access I believe."
