GeniusAnswered on 28 Jul 2019You definitely need to be able to gather a pool of interested stall tenants before even considering this business. If you were to purchase an entire existing coffeeshop if may cost you around $5000 psf and up. Leasing it would probably cost you about $30psf per month; a small coffeeshop probably around $75,000 - $120,000 each month. Refurbishing/Creating a new layout for a bare unit would also incur huge costs. Profits would probably be about 10-20% of subletting rental revenue? Largely depending on how you run your business. Coffeeshops like kopitiam/food republic iâ€™m sure charge tenants a percentage of their gross turn over(GTO) as well as charges for the cleaners/utilities/branding?However you do undertake huge risk as well as difficulty in managing the coffeeshop, providing and ensuring quality, consistency, diversity of stallsSo it is a highly competitive and capital intensive business to be in. When successful however, very lucrative. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bukit-batok-coffee-shop-sold-for-31mhttps://www.google.com.sg/amp/www.asiaone.com/business/hougang-coffee-shop-sold-record-238m%3famp0 comments4"
