1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi guys! I will share some information that I have picked up online and some simple thoughts that I have here.Business ProfileCapitaLand Limited is one of the largest real estate companies in Asia with an AUM of almost a $100bn. Most Singaporeans are quite familair with this brand name, and especially with the iconoic malls that they have such as Ion Orchard and Bedok Mall. They also have significant properties in China such as Raffles City Beijing. Its properties comprise of residential, shopping malls, offices and serviced apartments, with stakes in numerous funds and REITs.FinancialsIncome StatementRevenue for FY18 improved significantly by 21.3%, and with improved cost of sales, gross profit margin had improved by 32.9% YOY. Profit from operations also improved by 31.6% due to lower adminstrative and operating expenses. Finance costs had increased though, due to more debt being taken on. Nontheless, net profits grew by 21.4% YOY.Balance SheetCurrent Ratio seems relatively healthy at 1.5X, which cash and receivables forming the bulk of current assets. Current liabilities comprise largely of short-term borrowings as well. The company also seems better leveraged with a D/E ratio of 0.56X. YOY changes also includes write-down of intangible assets and reduction in net PPE.Cashflow StatementsThere has been a worsening in cashflow from operating activities due to weakened working capital conditions despite improvements in earnings. Cashflows from investing activities increased due to dividednds received from associates, JVs and investments and lesser acquisitions for investment properties. Cashflows from financing activities had reduced due to share buybacks, repayment of borrowings and lesser contributions from non-controlling interests.ValuationCurrently, the shares are trading at a trailing P/E of 9.51, a P/S of 2.76, a P/B of 0.81 and EV/Sales of 8.69 and a EV/EBITDA of 21.Key OpportunitiesDiversified Across Asset ClassesThe diverse earnings base that the company has, spread across different regions, properties and investments helps to diversify some of the risk away. Both rental income and sale of properties helps to reduce the exposure of business during a downturn.Growth ProfileWith strategic plans to acquire more properties and expand into the ASEAN market, this would further help to broaden their assets and revenue base. This is especially true for the Chinese market, which seems to have good growth potential.RisksGeographical RiskMuch of revenue still flows from China and Singapore, which means that a large amount of risk is focused here. Any changes in economic conditions, government policies and regulations, can cause a significant impact. Moreover, such policy effects can be quite sudden as well.Economic SlowdownSlowing growth in China, and a potential property bubble in Singapore could cause property prices and rental income to be affected in the future. Since much of the risk is concentrated in these 2 regions, CapitaLand will need to hedge such risk effectively.1 comment5"
