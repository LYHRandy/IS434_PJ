1,Von TanLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi currently the bond is trading at 1.028 on SGX. If the price remain unchanged at the end of 5 years does it mean that I will make a profit on the capital as well or I will just get back the original principle sum that I invested? Thank you.1 comment0
