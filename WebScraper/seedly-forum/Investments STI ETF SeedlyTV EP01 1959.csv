1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Hello!i personally feel that there is a lack of diversification in the STI ETFs since it is heavily weighted in favour of financials, which makes up a very large percentage of the index (if im not wrong its 59%) The top 3 constituents of the STI are banks, DBS, OCBC, UOB, which together comprises about 40%, thus i feel that it is too heavily concentrated in one area. Also, investing in th STI ETFs would also mean that you are investing locally, thus you are potentially putting all your eggs into one basket if you are also working in SIngapore. If Singapore were to one day lose its competitiveness, it is likely that your investments would suffer as well as your job.0 comments2"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 28 Mar 2019I think one of the main disadvantages would be the low returns of the STI (blue line), espeically when compared againstthe S&P500 (red line). All of them started off the around the same post 0'8 crisis, but their difference as of today is quite stark. You can tell a significant increase from the S&P, but the STI index has hardly moved, merely making similar gains and losses such that the net effect is eliminated.If you had put your money in the S&P, which has a much more diversified base than the STI (with much of its weight on the banks), you would have clearly done much better. The S&P is not heavily weighted too much on a certain company (as compared to STI), and many of these companies have got huge international exposure like Apple, Shell etc. From a risk diverisfication point of view, the S&P seems stronger.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019I think Isaac really hit the nail on its head with the proven lower returns from '08 to present day.To elaborate on Zann's last point, I believe its not so much so extreme as to when SG's competitiveness is diminished but rather the dependency of core businesses in our country to foreign exports. Disregarding Bank Stocks + ComfortDelGro, local SG companies of scale are intertwined some form of Global Operations and heavily influenced by foreign markets while also not sharing the full upside during US/China booms (possibly due to lower volume and liquidity of SGX markets in general). Therefore this resulted in a somewhat stagnant STI returns from the course of '08 till today.0 comments0"
