2,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019If you're talking about investing then I would personally suggest Fundamental analysis. Look at how the business is performing over the years, the various ratios and compare it with it's peers in the same sector. Technical analysis are more often than not, practised by traders. Finding right entry / exit points through the use of algo-trading whereby one uses codes to automatically execute trade once the series of technical indicators are met.0 comments0"
