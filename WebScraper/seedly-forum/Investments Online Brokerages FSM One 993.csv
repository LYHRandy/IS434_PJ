Other brokers like Philips have done something similar.Good for parking for investment funds and always be ready to deploy them quickly and earn some interest while waiting.Do note that this type of accounts are not covered under SDIC unlike our local banks where deposit and savings account are covered by SDIC. So, I guess don't park everything inside just to be safe.0 comments1"
