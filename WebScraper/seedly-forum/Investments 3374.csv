1,"Joash ChuaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 06 Jun 2018If you are new to investments and stocks, I do suggest reading books like The Intelligent Investor or anything by Warren Buffett, and studying some finance 101 to get you up to speed about understanding financial ratios.​You may try your hand on a trading simulator but frankly the amount of time you spend on the simulation is going to be a poor return on your invested time. I know the saying goes ""practice makes perfect"" so more time on simulator means you get good at investing right?​Unfortunately, no. Perfect practice makes perfect. If you don't know what you are doing on the simulator, you will still have no idea what you are doing 100 hours later. Investments take a lot of time, investments demands you do your homework and really study, and investments do not tolerate short cuts (like buying/selling based on a tip from friend of friend etc.). That's speculating, not investing.0 comments1"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Start by knowing yourself first. Why do you want to invest? What is your investment psychological profile like? Will you be able to sleep well at night if the value of your investments plunge? Read up readily available material like the intelligent investor, learn to earn or financial blogs like investment moats. These will give you a grasp of what doing investment is like. The only platforms I know that allows simulated trading is oanda and thinkorswim. The former is meant for forex while the latter only covers US market. Hope this helps 2 comments0"
