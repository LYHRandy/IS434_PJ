question,"Travel Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Jul 2019Does anyone know if I can still do tax refund across Europe (e.g. purchase something from Paris and do a refund in London) after Brexit (31 Oct 2019)? I'll be going on a Europe trip soon and don't know much about the tax refund system. Say, I purchase something in Paris but would like to do a refund in London. Is that possible given the Brexit circumstances? Thanks for the help in advance!2 answersAnswerBump0"
