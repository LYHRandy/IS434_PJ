Just a word of caution, I wouldn't scrimp on my eyesight as I heard from a friend before who made hers online claiming they have the latest technology for the best price and she experienced discomfort and headaches often after receiving her glasses. Hope you find a reliable yet reasonably priced spectacle shop! :)0 comments1"
