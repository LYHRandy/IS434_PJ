For SSBs part, you can apply 5k for every months issue till you used up all 50k(around 10months)  and if you have some more spare, invest in that another 2 months. So you can have double coupon repayment every month. Some may say 6 months will be enough for every month to have coupon repayments. But if you have more spare cash, why not. And since now SSBs are oversubscribed so the allocation are pretty less one can get per months issue. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I'm been using maxi gain since last October and I just leave my funds there untouched to earn the bonus interest. If you are gonna set up salary crediting into this account, it may not be a good idea as you need to ensure that the lowest balance in current month is equal or higher than lowest balance in previous month.. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I would focus on a more rounded approach and go with accounts and credit cards like DBS Mulitplier or UoB one account. This would encompass both a savings element and a credit card spending element. ​Both allows for higher interest on the 50k 0 comments1"

8,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 22 Jul 2018Citibank Maxigain. Will yield you 1.2% then step up monthly to 2.4% (based on current sibor). However if you withdraw the principal, your counter will drop. For no frills 1% per annum interest is CIMB fast saver.SSB so far only allocates around 12k. So you need 4-5 months to fully allocate 50k. However ssb is long term 10 years. 0 comments0"
