It is no difference than taking a new mortgage loan from another bank, except the fact that there are some fees payable to bank (usually subsidized if you loan is more than xx amount, but take note that the bank will crawl back this subsidy if you refinance again within 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 02 Jan 2019Why not talk to the bank representative to understand more.Because I personally did not deal with the bank (I took HDB Loan), I am unable to assist much.What I do know is they term it as re-financing for the change of payment period. There are fees and charges (likely in the $2k region) so you have to make your own judgment call. 0 comments0"
