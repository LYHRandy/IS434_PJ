question,"Investments Regular Shares Savings Plans (RSS) STI ETF Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoIs investing in the STI-ETF more suitable for long term investors (looking at more than 4-5 years)?I'm currently still in uni, looking for ways to start investing, approx. $100-200 monthly via RSP with POSB?And also, I understand that there are possible risks of losing the capital. But am I right to say that if I were to start investing now, and in 5 years the economy is doing better than the current market, I would not lose any of my capital? Sorry in advance if my question is not phrased in the best way possible. :)3 answersAnswerBump1"

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi anon, when we talk about the long term, we're looking at more than 10 years, easily. What would be your reason for investing in the STI? Looking at the past 10 years, STI hasn't really performed well relative to other markets. Definitely, when you invest, your capital will be at risk. But regardless of country, if markets are doing well, then you can expect that your portfolio value will be more than what you had invested. Still, it counts for nothing if you do not take the profit off the table.If you do $100-$200/mth, you will have to look into the fees that you have to pay directly to the bank via their RSP scheme. These will erode your returns. I would advise you to find out more information about the options available to you before you start. Speak with an independent advisor to know your options before you start. You still have time as you are in your 20s.4 comments2"
2,"See all 4 comments T@Takingstock @2w agoHowever anon, there are risks to buying an etf if your horizon is 5 years. That's more medium term than long term. The etf may not be the best investment, but we dont know what your goals, or risk preference are. There's always a chance that the etf may be at net loss to you after five years.Elijah Lee2w agoHi takingstock, noted on your POV. Just want to point out that the 0.82% and the 0.5% for the two ETFs is the sales charge (this was stated on POSB's website). This does not include the management fee and expenses of the ETFs, which is priced into the fund."

Why do you wish to only invest 4 - 5 years? Do you need investment capital for something? Why are you starting to invest?
These questions will help you with your investment journey. While many of the comments below are talking about finding more information, my recommendation is to start while you can (with a low-risk option) AND find out about investments and its related knowledge to slowly refine your portfolio!Of course, do look for a trusted advisor to clear your doubts with regards to investments and its intricacies, you can DM me if you have any questions!2 comments0"
4,"Question Poster2w agoSorry if I’ve phrase my question unclearly, what I meant was, I’m comfortable with investing this amount ($100-200) monthly for more than 4-5 years. I’m not restricting myself for just investing for 4-5 years and just stopping there. I’m looking into the STI-EIF because it suits my current budget as a student. By investing in the RSP is sort of a passive investment. Upon graduation I don’t wish to just only invest in STI-ETF but perhaps look into the S&P 500 (haven’t really looked into it in-depth wise).  
You mentioned Low risk options, would like to find out more. Thanks!SLSamuel Lee2w agoHi Anon, if you are receiving notifications for this, there are 3 questions I would like to ask you.
What is the purpose for investing?
What is your anticipated returns?
What is your risk tolerance?

RookieAnswered 2w agoHi anon, I am a uni student too, rather than investing the $100-200 into STI-ETF, I recommend that you build your warchest to buy stocks that will give you better returns than the STI. Don’t be afraid of losing your capital, we are at the age whereby we should be making plenty of mistakes!2 comments0"
