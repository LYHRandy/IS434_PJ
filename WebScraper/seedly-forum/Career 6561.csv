1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do you intend to use data analytics to further up your career or currently just an interest? If you are into this, you can consider using SkillsFuture Credit for data analytics courses at TP or the unis. If it's just a hobby at this point in time, YouTube would be your best friend.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster11 Dec 2018Thanks for the advice. Career wise, just that have no knowledge on it. Do you recommend online courses like udemy and coursera?Lok Yang Teng11 Dec 2018I think as long as you get the (relevant) skill, doesnt matter where you learn it from. Just need to be able to showcase your skills during interview for example."
