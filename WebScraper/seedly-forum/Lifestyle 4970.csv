In a way, the money spent motivates me to attend classes every day so that I can inch towards my fitness goals.Master’s degreeIt’s damn tiring to do a part-time degree on top of a full-time job. The paper qualification doesn’t add as much value to a Bachelor’s degree compared to a Bachelor’s degree‘s added value to a diploma. But the knowledge learned benefited me in other ways.0 comments5"

ProdigyAnswered on 28 Jan 2019I think it is a natural tendency for people to be against anything which isn't affordable to them. I am writing it as per my own experience. For me, I have seen people saying ""not worth the money"" in cases where I plan to buy something expensive esepcially mobile phones. I am generally advised to stick to budget phones rather than high end premium handsets.0 comments0"
