1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Jun 2018Hi, I would recommend Vietnam as it's not very expensive and you can travel to different cities within the country. Flight tickets (Scoot/Jetstar) costs less than $150 and your expenses there should be relatively cheap too. Last year, I flew to Ho Chi Minh City and also went to others cities, namely, Vung Tau, Hanoi, Danang, Hoi An, Hue, Phan Thiet/Mui Ne. You can travel around the country by domestic flight (Vietjet/Jetstar), train or bus. You can also check out Sapa and Halong Bay too, I didn't manage to go to those places due to lack of time. 0 comments1"

3,"Xin YingLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 25 Jun 2018The best place depends on your interests - is it food, photography, adventure or culture? In general, the SEA region would probably offer a decent mix of the above, or perhaps even some countries that are slightly further like Korea or Australia (but you need to try and aim for off-peak travel and dorms, perhaps).0 comments1"
