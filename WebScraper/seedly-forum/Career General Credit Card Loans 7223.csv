You may go Credit Counselling, etc, workout some arrangement. ​2) Make sure to Pay on time all the credit used.​3) try again in 6 months time for the credit bureau to update to a better score while waiting for the RNF to be completed.​4) Try to get all credit card debt to be under personal loan or lowered interest.​That's all i can say and help​0 comments0"
