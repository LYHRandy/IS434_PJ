question,"Retirement Lifestyle Asked by Jacqueline YanAsked on 21 Sep 2019What are some of your plans after achieving FIRE?I'm just kapoh-ing... But seeing that majority of Singaporeans may still have to work until the retirement age, we won't have much time to set aside for enjoyment and personal fulfilment. Let's say you retire by 45, that's at least 40 more years to go. How would you allocate your time afterwards? Travel the world? Learn a new skill?4 answersAnswerBump2"

1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Sep 2019I would continue working but I won't be tied down to any job because of money. If the people or working hours  are bad, I can just quit anytime.Definitely spend more time with family, read more books like camp in library whole day like those retired uncles. Maybe take up some courses like cooking, gardening and going hiking in Singapore nature reserves!2 comments3"

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 24 Sep 2019I did a calculation and realized that I do have 20 years of annual solo expenses saved. Even with that, I definitely baulked at the idea of not working on something or having something to look forward to every day. Additionally, I need to think about my parents' living expenses, on top of my own. But let's say I retire (ie. don't need to work) at 45, I would spend my time in gerontology, and explore what makes people age better. Travelling to more interesting places in the world would be another one, but this will definitely be with loved ones. Have done my fair bit of solo business travels, so likely won't do that. I would also have a physical sport as a hobby since candidly, the human body rarely gets more agile with age!2 comments1"
4,"Jacqueline Yan3w agoOh wow, that's a very substantial amount! I wonder how long it'll take for me to achieve that... 

Your plan to venture into gerontology sounds interesting!Junus Eu3w ago@jacqueline we all either get old or die ;)"
5,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered 4w agoI think I would take some years to travel and see the world.When I am back, I would continue working because I feel like I need some kind of routine in my life. I would also spend more time with my family, and keep learning new things so that I can keep up with the times. Would also engage in hobbies or learn new hobbies!1 comment0"
6,"Jacqueline Yan3w agoYes! Definitely will spend a lot of time travelling around to experience new things! 

Agree with you though, I don't think I can get used to not working, if I ever FIRE"

Grand MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2019Run for politics, maybe be a preside... nevermind. :Dhere are the serious things I will do if I manage to FIRE.1) Travel the world2) support a charity of my choice (I tend to like animals so probably some animal shelters in Singapore, and if I am capable enough, support a nature reserve in Indonesia)3) HOBBIES - get some interesting hobbies, do a blog on it, or youtube and just live it well and take it easy.unfortunately, I will never FIRE. I don't think I like to stay still. I like working for myself and I like starting business... so I guess if technically on ""FIRE"" this will be my major activity4) starting and guiding new business...
I will enjoy it, I will appreciate the thinking and the planning to keep my brain active. I will probably appreciate the extra income (or losses... lol)it's gonna be fun.1 comment0"
8,"Jacqueline Yan3w agoI agree! I'm definitely super far from FIRE but if I ever achieve it, I doubt I'll stop working. 

Starting new businesses is definitely interesting! Don't have that many ideas though"
