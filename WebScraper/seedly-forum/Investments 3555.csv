4,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Jun 2018Yup! The only brokerages which don't require a CDP are like Saxo and SCB. They are custodians who actually hold the purchased shares on your behalf, if I am not wrong.​Also, another way is to use the Bank's RSP (Regular Saving Plans) where they invest on your behalf monthly. You can find out more about these here: https://blog.seedly.sg/which-regular-savings-plan-is-the-cheapest/​With all that being said, would highly recommend for you to create a RSP as it is really fuss free and easy to do so also. It may take 1 week or so (which is kinda lame in today's time)  Cheers!0 comments1"
