question,"Lifestyle Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Oct 2018What credit cards should I own (for fresh grad)?Hello. I would like to know what credit card I should apply for. I'm looking for a card that earns good cashback for shopping, online spending and travel (foreign currency expenditure or travel)? Not sure if i should apply different cards for these expenses or is there a card that allows me to fully maximise the cashback (or even rewards points or miles) from these expenditures? Thank you!! :)2 answersAnswerBump0"

Some of them focus on miles, others on cashback, so it's really about what you want. For fresh grads, most people generally recommend OCBC 360 or DBS multiplier because of the higher interest rate- provided you fulfil the requirements!0 comments0"
