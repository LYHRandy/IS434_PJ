1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019From the way you're phrasing the question, it seems like to me you are speculating rather than investing. If you are: Value investing: the current prices does not matter since it is expected that future price will increaseTechnical investing: looking for trends over the past hour/day/week (though there's still speculative elements to it)If you are unsure of the product, it is best not to invest in it. Personally, my approach would tend towards value investing and I find that there isn't anything to support the value of bitcoin.0 comments0"
