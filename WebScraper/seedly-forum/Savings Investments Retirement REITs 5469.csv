God of WisdomAnswered on 17 Jul 2019I wouldn't invest anything volatile if I require the money in the next 3 years time. You can look at SSB, Fixed Depost, or short term endowment policies as options.
For long term, building a globally diversified portfolio with attention to asset allocations and shifting strategies as you age and get closer to retirement is a great idea to invest for retirement in 30-40 years.I follow a ABCD framework which stands for:  Adventurous, Balanced, Cautious, and Defensive which would allow us to invest properly as we age.
Something like the following may constitute an adventurous approach:I've been speaking recently to young couples and families our age (I'm 26 too) with regards to this. I'd love to show you some guidelines and plot an idea of how this investment journey of yours may look like which will include things like emergency expenses and when to accumulate and when to collect dividends.My job is to make sure you're able to reach your goals with the least risk possible and coach you and helping you understand how we react to markets and the rules we follow as investors.If you'd like to understand more, I'm always a message away.0 comments2"
