(or 5 Points = 2 KrisFlyer Miles)Now, the Citi Miles that you earn on your card aren't true air miles. They are like reward points which you can convert to KrisFlyer Miles. However, since the mile conversion rate is 1:1, you can imagine them as the same amount of KrisFlyer Miles you'd get if you were to redeem.If you hold other Citibank credit cards that reward you with points (in the form of Citi Dollars) instead of miles, you can have your points converted to miles as well.According to Citi, for every 5 points that you transfer, 2 miles will be credited into your frequent flyer account.How To Redeem Citi Miles For KrisFlyer MilesYou will first need to have a KrisFlyer account and a Citi account online.Signing up for a KrisFlyer account is free on the Singapore Airlines website, but note that a KrisFlyer account will be closed after 39 months from the date of your last activity recorded.
