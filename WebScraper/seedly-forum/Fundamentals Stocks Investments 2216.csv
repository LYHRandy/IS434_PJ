1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019You could try things out on a stock investing simulator- but really trade with the mentality as though you are using your own personal savings. I think many people use simulators but ultimately dont find it useful because they don't feel the pinch. Ultimately, there is no one person in the world with perfect investing knowledge. Even Warren Buffet makes mistakes and has learnt plenty throughout his investment journey.0 comments1"

Your investment portfolio performance.If you are afraid, hesitant, lack the confidence to start, just do it BUT start with a small amount.The only way to build confidence in investing is by actually investing. Same like swimming. You can practise the strokes and hand movements in the wading pool or on land but if you never swam in a deeper pool, you will never build that swimming confidence. No amount of practise can match up to doing the real thing.0 comments1"

Learning is a lifelong process and you should never ever feel like you are 'good' enough!For myself, I'm relatively new to investing and i find myself learning something new every day.0 comments0"
