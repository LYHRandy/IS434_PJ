MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Is there a reason why that 1% is attractive enough to risk late payment penalty and interest?Never follow what your peers are doing without thinking thru what is the best options for urself.Usually credit cards needs a required spending amount to get annual waiver if is the free period is over.As a NSF/Students without good consistent income, spending should not be the focus which credit cards allows u to possibly spend over the amount of savings you really have in ur bank account.Go for Debit Card that gives at least 5% cash back which is still currently available in the market.Hope this reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments2"

For me credit card force me to think of a way to get money to pay for the credit usage. E.g. Selling that underused speaker/guitar. I'm a NSF too. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 11 Sep 2018Not really a good ideal. ​Use a debit card like DBS 5% cash back on pay wave. ​it would be better to delay getting a credit card until you are working and learnt the basics of budgeting and expenses 0 comments1"
5,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Sep 2018I don't think this is a wise idea! Just use the debit card, to get 5 - 10% cashback on your paywaves. Having been an NSF once before, it was really more than enough.​And even better cos next time you can actually get a good deal when you sign up for a proper card as a 'new customer' of CITI or DBS. (which usually offer such cards) Cheers and all the best. Please keep your spending in check! Eat more cookhouse food and save up.0 comments1"
