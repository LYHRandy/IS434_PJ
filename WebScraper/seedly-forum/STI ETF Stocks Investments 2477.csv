1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Mar 2019I feel that profitability may be one thing, but the risk you take to earn that profit is another. The lower volatility and general stability of the Singapore economy may be helpfuly for more passive investors who would want to see consistent returns, even if the returns are not too high. It will probably boil down to your risk appetite, and what kind of returns you want.0 comments0"
2,"Terence Tan, Finance at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Mar 2019That is the perception. This is because Singapore market is less volatile and less liquid. Traders love 20% gain in a day. But investors should be patience and wait for it.Furthermore, US has options to make passive income too.For me, I feel it is because SG is less exciting that people are exiting. In a past course presentation, I already stated that Boring is good. When you feel bored means that you have found a way to make consistent gains. When that happens, why choose to jump into an unfamiliar terriority?0 comments0"
