1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Mar 2019NPV is often preferred in decision making since it measures the absolute amount of value add the firm can take. This is quite useful when comparing making choices between different decisions. IRR is measure of the return based on the amount you invested, so the measurement of IRR is more relative than absolute. But in most instances, you could use both forms to make decisions regarding your investments. One disadvantage of NPV is that you got to come up with a discount rate, which is quite tough especially if you have to compare projects with different risk profiles. Different groups of investors also use IRR and NPV too. For example, Private Equity firms often look at IRR, while other buy or sell side firms may use NPV in the form of a DCF for different functions.0 comments0"
