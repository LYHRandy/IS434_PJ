1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Personally I don't think I would have changed many things professionally/financially, because I looked 5 years out when I was 20, and thought about the steps to take. I also make sure to spend time with loved ones, so I think I did seek some balance there. What I would have changed is to pursue my passions earlier in life.3 comments2"

3,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019Probably I'd work harder as an athlete and try to represent Singapore at least once. I'd make better decisions with girls and treat my family with more respect and appreciation.0 comments1"
4,"Heng Kai Le, Mondomover at School Of LifeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 20199 years ago, when I was 30, I was a polytechnic lecturer and was working towards my dream of working in Japan as an Assistant Language Teacher. A year later, my dream came true.I did save enough to continue to give my parents housekeeping money during my Japan stint, but if i had known what i know now, i ought to have started my investment journey then. still, i have no regrets. i had my hands full and my head occupied with learning Japanese and taking on passion projects to beef up my resume, so i did the best i could then :)thanks for the chance to take a trip down memory lane0 comments0"
5,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I probably wouldn't change my profession.Although I only made my decision on the field after my A levels, I considered both the subject I like best (Arts) but get bad grade in, and what subjects I am good at in school (Maths & Physics). Also considered if the field I'm venturing into has any future.I'm in the field most suitable for me, which combines my likes & abilities.Still love what I do after 20 years. At most some of the decisions I make might defer to make my project work better.Financially, I would probably make changes, by learning & investing earlier, probably get a part time job to chiong while I'm younger.1 comment0"
