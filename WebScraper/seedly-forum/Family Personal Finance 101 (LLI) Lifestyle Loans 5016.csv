question,"Family Personal Finance 101 (LLI) Lifestyle Loans Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Dec 2018When is the best time to change my car?I bough my car for $108,000 in Aug 2014 so its about 4.5 years old. COE then was high at $52k. It is fully paid up now and reaching 40,000km and will be due for a major servicing soon. With the low COE now, can someone advise if its advisable to change my car for a new one now? Cos with the low car prices now, I will make paper losses if I sell now. Which would make more financial sense - to keep to my existing car or trade-in for a new one. Seeking any car guru's advise and thank you.2 answersAnswerBump0"

ProdigyAnswered on 17 Dec 2018You have to do the calculations as it also depends on the new car price.Don't forget to include the depreciated value in your old car for the calculation.What you effectively are doing is.New car 10 year + old car 4.5 year = 14.5Old car 4.5 value + new Car value - the value you take back at the end of new car 10 year / 14.5 = new depreciation.Some people only calculate base on new car value over 10 years which is not right as you using your old car to trade in. This is value that you paid for 4.5 years ago. It's not free value.0 comments0
