God of WisdomAnswered 2d agoHi anon, yes, there is actually a outpatient health plan for GP and specialist, however, it requires you to be a MINDEF Group Term policyholder first.More details can be found here: https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/mindef-and-mha/outpatient-medicare/
So your integrated shield plan would cover your hospitalization, pre and post expenses, and if you desire, the MINDEF outpatient medicare rider can cover ad-hoc GP visits.I'd only recommend it if your company does not have comprehensive employee benefits for GP/specialist.1 comment5"

ProdigyAnswered 2d agoHi Anon, for outpatient coverage for GP & Specialists, they are usually provided by Employee Benefits or Corporate Insuance which is generally provided by your company. Do check with your HR on what are your entitlements.If you're looking for a standalone to buy for your personal consumption, I don't recall there's any plans in the market now that;s providing that.To answer your 2nd question, most of MediSave Integrated Shield plan covers Pre & Post hospitalisation consultations & treatments. Do take note that the main difference between the different companies are the duration of the pre & post hospitalization benefit coverage.0 comments1"

Outpatient health plans are usually parked under the cooperate insurance which your company may provide. Some benefits involved like paying $5 for a consultation at selected GPs. Do contact your HR to find out if you have such a benefit."
