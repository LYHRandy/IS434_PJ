FreshieAnswered on 01 May 2018The  medical information is to access and evaluate the risk of applicant taking up the loan .The loan  amount would be covered by mortgage reducing term insurance ( also a housing protection scheme - HPS ), premium can  be paid either cash or cpf - OA .That insurance is to protect applicant and  applicant's family member against the unforeseen event happen for losing  their home .​​​​​​​​​​​​​0 comments0"

RookieAnswered on 25 Apr 2018If you are using CPF to pay for your flat downpayment or monthly installments - this is probably linked to the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) insurance which will leave your HDB flat fully paid upon death/permanent disability up till your 65th birthday. ​It works like any other insurance and they'll want to know if you have any pre-existing conditions which will disqualify you for the HPS.  This HPS is payable through your CPF. 0 comments0
