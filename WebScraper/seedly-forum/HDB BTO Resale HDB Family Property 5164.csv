question,HDB BTO Resale HDB Family Property Asked by AnonymousAsked 6d agoShould we go for a 3-bedroom in a mature estate or a 4-bedroom in a non-mature estate?Which is advisable or worth it? 3BR in mature or 4BR in non-mature given the price is similar. Even with 1 child in the near future (3-4 years time) is still ok for us. Another question is BTO or resale in consideration of the above? Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump0
