1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Apr 2019Coming from the perspective of someone who has invested in both properties and stocks, it does not need to be one of the other. That said, here are the key differences based on my experience:Initial Cash Outley/Capital NeededFirstly, from an accessibility perspective, you would need lower capital to invest in stocks. Unless you have a large amount of cash lying around for down payment, it is not likely that you will be able to pay for property from the get-go.Risk profileThere are two camps to this. Investors who prefer stocks will say that:Rental properties require more work (I did have to spruce up the apartment and we gave it a new coat of paint)Risk of tenants damaging the property (I just had to pay for things when say, washing machine broke down, but so far my tenant has been a nice person!)Tenants gone rogue and don't pay rent (happened to me as well)On the other hand, property investors, will tell you the age-old:Property will always be there. Ie. is it more tangible.Not as volatile as stocksNot at the mercy of speculators who dictate the market performance.Holding PowerI definitely will not sell my property now as I am in it for the long term (and see a significant appreciation in value), but I can sell my stocks anytime I need for liquidity. Think about how much liquidity you will need - property does not offer that level of liquidity.0 comments2"

Stocks (Equities) carry a diverse range of risks and returns, depending on the type of business that these firms are operating, or the geographical location they are in, determining the type of macroeconomic risk that they are exposed to. These types of businesses range from high growth stocks such as pharmeceuticals, Technology Companies, to stable, low growth defensive stocks such as Ultility companies. Property, on the other hand, are usually a part of Real Estate Investment Trusts, which pool capital from multiple investors to manage and acquire property that generate income via rent/ usage. One such REIT is the CapitaLand Mall Trust (C38U), with a corporate portfolio that includes mutiple retail shopping malls in Singapore such as Tampines Mall and Jcube etc. These REITS provide attractive dividend returns.Hence it entirely depends on the type of return and investment goal you are looking at. Long or Short? Capital appreciaition or wealth accumulation? Risky or Safe? these questions must first be answered and understood before we can decide whether stocks, property, fixed income, or other asset classes are more appropriate, and what proportion to invest in them.0 comments1"
3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Hello!There is not really an answer for this question as it will depend on personal preferences as well as your preferred style of investing. Here are some advatages of both types of investment for you to compare to potentially help you to decide which you will prefer. Some advatages of real estate is that it is tangible and it is easier to avoid fraud with real estate. Real estate has also historically served as an effective inflation hedge. While for stocks, owning stocks would mean that you can own part of a business without having to do any work. It is easier to diversify with stocks as compared to real estate. Stock investments are also very liquid which means that your money is not locked up for a period of time.  Also, high quality stocks not only increases their profits each year but the cash dividened also increases. Hope this helps!0 comments1"

If you feel emotional every time when your stock price decrease then property should be the better instrutment  for you.0 comments0"

Different asset classes, different risk, different minimum requirement.A financial portfolio however, will have a mix of all asset classes.0 comments0"
