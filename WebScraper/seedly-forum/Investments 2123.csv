2,"Samuel Chin20 Mar 2019Make use of high-interest savings account due to their multipliers. Check if you hit the requirement (like giro transactions, monthly spendings) and minimum sum needed inside. Can look into Singapore Savings Bond as well if got any extra cash. Spend some time reading up on personal finance since army has much more free time and lesser worries."
