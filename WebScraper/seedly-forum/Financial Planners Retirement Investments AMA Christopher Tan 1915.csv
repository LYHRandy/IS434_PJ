1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jan 2019Hi anonymous, thanks for your question and sorry for the late reply. $4 million seems like a huge nunber. It will be difficult for me to answer this question unless I knowHow much are you able to set aside per month to accumulate towards that?How much lump sum capital can you set aside now to invest towards that?What is your risk appetite?There are various instruments such as bonds, equities and properties that can help you achieve your goals. But without knowing the details as stated above, it would be difficult to suggest.I generally will not suggest using insurance as an instrument to save towards retirement (except for annuities, which is a useful instrument in retirement). This is because insurance is an expensive instrument and it is really meant more for protection rather than investment. 0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Jan 2019What is your risk appetite and what is the amount you are willing to set aside to fund your retirement? 4 million over 20 years would mean 200k a year in cash terms (with zero investments). If I were to take SPY's (S&P500 ETF)  annualised returns of 8.99% as an example, you will need a principal amount of $750k in USD terms over a period of 20 years to reach your goal of 4 million. Can be a daunting amount. If you have a bigger risk appetite, consider learning to manage an options portfolio where you can look at a possible 30-40% returns rate. 4 million can be reached with a principal of 5k and compounded at 40% over 20 years. 0 comments0"
3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 25 Jan 2019You'll need to start investing 9K per month in an instrument that gives you 6% returns compounded over 20 years to achieve $4m in total return or 11200 per month in an instrument that gives you 4% returns compunded over 20 years. A balanced portfolio of 50% Equity and 50% bonds can probably provide you 5-6% returns over 20 years or Endowment Plans or a more Conservative 30% Equity 70% Bond portfolio can potentially give you 4% returns. 0 comments0"
