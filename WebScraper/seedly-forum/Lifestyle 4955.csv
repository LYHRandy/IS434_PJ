question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Feb 2019What are the activities you can easily do with your own car but not with Taxi/Grab?Our financial status:29yo. No kids and not planning to have one in 5 years. After that prolly never have one.Combined income: about 360k/yr, fixed salaryMonthly expense: 4k home loan + 5k other expenses.Saving: 70k (just bought a property, still catching up)I love driving and I'd like to buy one while COE is still cheap but wife is not keen. I feel we are able to afford one while still saving up if we reduce other expenses. So what areas can a private car improve on our lives?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Firstly, your current financial status is pretty impressive!Based on what you have shared, it seems like you are definitely comfortable in affording a car! (unless you are talking about Ferraris, Rolls Royce etc)I guess you are looking for reasons to convince your wife and here are some:1) No waiting time or dealing with surge. It can be quite tough to get a Grab/Taxi during peak hours or when it is raining.2) Able to explore places to paktor which may not be convenient with Taxi/Grab3) Able to ferry your parents and In-laws when required. (family gatherings, makan etc)4) Supper or weekend outings in JBEven with all the suggestions above, it is more important to first understand why your wife isnt keen on getting one. With that, it is much easier to handle her objections.If cost is a main concern, perhaps you can consider an Off-Peak car, and also offer to send her to work daily so that she doesnt have to deal with the mad rush during rush hours!2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster18 Feb 2019Thank you, Brandan! You guessed it right, my wife's main concern is indeed cost. The complication is that both of us don't travel during peak hours as our working hours are between 1030 and 1900. She prefers us saving more money right now since we just bought our home and she hates seeing our saving reduce to zero again.

However, I'd like to get one while the COE is still low. I've read some articles saying COE in 2019 and 2020 can potentially be the cheapest in the next 10 years. So to be ...

One way of reducing cost is to do a couple of grab hitch to earn back some petrol, ERP, parking cost"
