question,"Lifestyle Career Salary Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Jul 2019Anyone has any tips as to not compare salaries with other people?I am 27 this year, a diploma grad earning $3.4k and have always been contented. This year, my friends have been comparing salaries and they earn more than me (they have a degree and are in different industries). I look at my cousins and they are young and successful, working as a wealth manager and making big bucks. This is a terrible feeling to have, and I honestly want to be rid of it :'( Sometimes I feel like I'm lacking, inferior and insufficient. Any advice?5 answersAnswerBump0"

Their salaries or how they live their lifestyles do not and should not affect you personally.  Its a vicious cycle and you are doing pretty good already with a good education, good paying job and more importantly good health.
Some things are worth more than others and cannot be measured by monetary value alone.  So don't let comparisons affect you.. There are poorer folks out there who have trouble bringing food to mouth.  Maybe start doing charity and donations to the needy if you ever feel like lacking, inferior or insufficient... you will find that you are much more blessed...0 comments6"

ProdigyAnswered on 25 Jul 2019Comparing salary is not necessarily a bad thing as it allows you to know if you are fairly compensated for your role.In your situation, I believe that you can take concrete steps to be on par. Research on the job you dream to have and how much salary it will command and you can take courses/part time degrees to upgrade yourself to reach that goal.Otherwise, if you are just happy where you are working now but unhappy that others make more than you, then it's simply envy. Don't let that destroy you. Your self worth is not determined by the paycheck.0 comments2"

I assume these are fair weather friends, if they see a need to compare salaries.Jokes aside, at a deeper level, ask yourself why they would see a need to flaunt how much they are earning. Some of the richest people I know say nothing about how much money they have, but value their friends genuinely. Money is only one aspect of things. A person's character and integrity are much more important traits in a friend. Besides, if you found yourself in a situation in desparate need of money one day, would this friend pass you the money you need? Food for thought.It would also help that you just compare yourself against your peers only on the basis of money. There are so many other things. Money is merely an enabler.0 comments2"

I also have friends who like to compare, I just laugh at them in my own heart. Because I know my wealth is greater and in the long run, they will work to death while I can retire earlier. No one likes to get rich slowly.0 comments2"

Different industries have different pay scales, e.g.  For Oil and Gas technicians is between 60k and 80k but has a age limit of 45. Mariners can get anywhere between 30k to 150k. Bankers upwards of 40k, but their career is limited to market performance.
Don't worry yourself about how much is the value of your time for money. Invest in yourself so that your money is turned into assets that can give you an income, then it is something to brag about, but by then you won't want people to know. Humility is security. Have faith in what you do.0 comments1"
