From my understanding, the ways in which stocks in China can be affected are largely dependent on how exposed they are to such currency risks.For example, company X, whose shares are listed on the exchange, is a company that relies heavily on exports to the US for its revenue. If the Yuan appreciates against the Dollar, company X's exports might be deemed as less competitive compared to other foreign competitors, resulting in a loss of revenue. On top of that, domestic consumers may in turn buy the same product that company X produces from a company in the US, as they can buy more of the same, with less RMB. This may result in the decrease in the share price.In another scenario, assuming company Y obtains finances to generate revenue through the issuance of offshore Dollar-denominated bonds, the net income of company Y in China will most likely increase as a result due to the fact they now have to pay less, hence increasing retained earnings - which usually ultimately leads to an increase in the share price.0 comments3"
