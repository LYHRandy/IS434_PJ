1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 27 May 2019Everyone starts from zero, unless you have rich family members to set up a trust fund for you since young. I would suggest saving consistently and as much as you can to give you some capital to invest with, and at the same time, start investing in small amounts for your own learning. Also look to discover your risk appetite, your holding period and also your investment goals. Take the time to learn about the different asset classes - for eg. Property takes a higher amount of up-front capital, and is less liquid compared to say, equities. When you amass your investment capital, then you can start investing more confidently towards your goals.0 comments1"
