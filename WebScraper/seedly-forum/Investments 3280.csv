question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Jul 2018How do I invest in REITs with a small sum of money?I've read up on REITs and am keen to invest in them. However, it seems that the only way to invest in them is through a brokerage. Is there any regular savings plan for REITs?I've read that Maybank rsp has ascenda REITs. Is it a good move to get through Maybank rather than through a brokerage?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Maybank ke (not maybank per se) does have a list of stocks that you can rsp into for as little as 100 per month. The list will include other reits like the ones from mapletree. Maybank ke will hold the shares in a custodian structure, so vis a vis to traditional brokers where the shares are deposited into your cdp account, the latter can be more expensive, commission wise. But it'll depend on the amount of shares you buy. Personally I like using maybank ke to buy shares via rsp and have been on it for a year and a half. Straight forward with 1% fees  and the monthly deduction can be done via giro. Hope this helps 4 comments0"

Hope to hear from you soon!Jonathan Chia Guangrong30 Jan 2019Hi Samuel. Are you referring to maybank ke's prefunded account? This is created when you wanna start a monthly investment plan with them, and no, you don't need 10k funding as I also didn't do this. I just setup giro for hassle free deduction to buy into my selected counter on a monthly basis "
