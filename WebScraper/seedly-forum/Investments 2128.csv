1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Mar 2019Invest part of your savings as you continue you to grow your savings. Start small with baby steps. Equity investments might be a way to start as you don't need a large amount of upfront capital.I did my first equity investment when I was in University as well. It was a daunting experience given it being the first time, and I kept eyeballing the stock, but at the end of the day - you need to live through those emotions and build your confidence over time!I made my first property investment at 26 - but i actually spent around 1.5 years scouting properties over the weekends. Property investments understandably require a higher amount of capital, so it makes sense to weigh accordingly.0 comments5"

ProdigyAnswered on 19 Mar 2019Best time to invest was yday, second best time is now!If you are unsure where to start off, I would recommed buying into a Index-linked traded fund (more commonly known as ETFs) tracking the S&P 500 index or any broad-based index. This is the most efficient way (time, cost, removing your emotions) to invest for an average investor with mild risk appetite  with a long-time horizon (10 years & above). You do so by buying thru a brokerage account or like many below who commented using a Robo-advisor.Here's a youtube interview by Jack Bogle, the father of Index funds in the 90s, the lessons he espoused still hold truth till this datehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teqK4Y5M4ycIn the meantime during university, continue to invest in yourself,  improve your future income potential  & build on your investment knowledge so by the time your graduate, you will be better equipped with both intelluctual & monetary capital to do your own portfolio of individual stocks & bonds, if you want to. If you had spare cash in excess of daily expenses & investment, do consider putting some into your CPF SA account to get a small headstart in fulfilling your FRS amount.All the best!0 comments3"

I'll just share a few reasons here.Passive InvestmentsBeing a student myself, I also try to invest in products that can yield some returns. Although as a student you may not have that much time like myself, investing in passive investments like bonds, ETFs, REITs is a good way to grow your investments without spending too much time on trying to track them.Compound ReturnsI'm sure you have heard that Einstein called compounding the 8th wonder of the world, so starting earlier gives you that advantage. Even if your 5k savings don't yield that much nominal returns, I believe it's still much better than leaving in the bank where inflation will erode your returns.More ConfidenceStarting early can also give you more opportunities to learn and grow, so that you may be more confident with other investments in the future.Might Have More Time to InvestFor some people, you might actually have more time in uni to learn and start investing than next time. Summer and winter breaks are a good opportunity to start learning!Clubs and CCAs in SchoolYou also have the network of investment clubs in school to help you learn more about finance and investing. Tap on those, because I really believe that a network of people interested to learn investing is very helpful! Access to such networks might be much harder once you leave school.0 comments2"

If these have been covered, then you can start small with regular savings plan. These help to build confidence over time as you build up your warchest :)0 comments2"

RookieAnswered on 23 Apr 2019I feel that you should not rush into investing that quick before you acquire knowledge like the know-how, the types of investments available, the cost, the risk-reward factor, etc.Savings still serves a purpose to tide you thru rainy days.And Investments requires constant and regular ""feeding"" in order to achieve the compounding effect.In order to feed, you need regular income.So If i have 5k I would not invest in any products now. But to study the know-how first and in the process find out what kind of investment products suit me best.0 comments1"
7,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Mar 2019Hello!I think that it would be a good idea to invest some of your savings as well as continue to build up your savings! I personally think that you should invest as early as possible. since you are still rather young, it would be good to start investing now! you do not have to invest all your savings, perhaps about $100 each month into ETFs and at the same time continue to build up your savings! Hope this helps and all the best in your invesment journey :)0 comments1"

9,Margarette Nicole SantosLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 19 Mar 2019You can try to invest a bit of your savings.. the earlier the better cos those investments take time to grow. It will also help you to develop good budgeting skills as it allows you to set aside on how much you may want to invest and keep as savings. Hope this helps! :)0 comments1

11,"Chua Wei FengLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 09 May 2019Firstly, do you have to pay your student loans after grad? If yes, your investment horizon will be when you graduate. If no, then great! You're off to a great head start already. Read up on passive investments such as robo advisers and sti etf to set up regular savings plan which can help you grow your savings. Also make sure you have 6 months of expenses in emergency funds in case of mishaps. Only then do you begin investing. When beginning to invest, take note of the formula of 100 - Age = % in equities/stocks. So put some money into bonds for portfolio balancing while trying to grow the rest through capitalising on compounding in the long run. Remember to plan with respect to your financial milestones, be it student loans or first house. All the best! All the info on the internet might be overwhelming but just know you're on the right path, thinking about finances is already a great first step in the right way! :)0 comments0"
12,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Mar 2019Hi there!I started with around 5-7k and I think thats more than enough! Of course, with that amount of that money you can't be expecting to buy stocks like Apple that costs around 178~ USD per share. For a start maybe you could do some research into some smaller-cap stocks that you can afford. Of course, like what Isaac mentioned, you can simply buy passive instruments like bonds, ETFs that doesn't require you to constantly monitor the markets (especially if you are busy with other uni commitments).0 comments0"
