Or you are changing fields.
Or you are not doing well in your current role.Always consider 15 to 20% increment.1) your current role is paying X amount because you deserve it.2) you are moving. New role new responsibility. It is to cover the change.3) you could stay and get increment and others anyway. So it is to their advantage to move you.Note that you also have to consider if you might be currently underpaid.Fully relying on salary guides is also risky as they are often only correct with context.0 comments0"

As for the question, instead of throwing a direct response, why not ask the interviewer how much they think you are worth0 comments0"
4,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Oct 2018Awkward questions hor ? :) hard to answer also.What I'll do:1) Market research job site for market rate.2) Based on my current rate, I can add 10% to 15%. Note: Some HR / agent like to play the total package game to add in AWS (13 month) and/or Bonus in the mixture. So start an excel sheet, do your own maths and decide if the amount is ok for you.  Just ensure yearly total always has a decent amount increase. 3) Usually agent will tell you the client budget and fight for you as high as possible because 1 month of your salary paid by the company is their commission. So it only do good for you and them if your salary is higher. However, they also need to balance the requirements from the client side, so it's like playing the game of balancing in a circles walk. The Pros of Higher monthly salary and No AWS / Bonus: Higher monthly salary and this is always good because $ in your pocket now rather than year end of Mar/Apr. Furthermore, usually HR words cannot be trusted. If you think your skill and talent nobody has or were rare, like good AI / DA skills, then ask more than 30% to 50% than market rate. It's a mind game and a market demand and supply thing, nothing is too high or too low.  The more you negotiate, the more you'll be better at it. May you get the best deal! :) 0 comments0"
