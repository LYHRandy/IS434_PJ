question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Sep 2019Would I be able to pursue a cloud computing career with a Diploma in Accountancy?Hi guys, I am 24 this year and have a Diploma in Accountancy. Have been working at an accounting firm for about 2 years, and am interested in learning about the Cloud and if possible, getting a career in it. Heard about those online courses like AWS Cloud Practitioner certs, Azure, etc. But would they really be enough to get me a job, or would I still need to pursue a degree? Would appreciate if anyone who has experience in this could shed some light! Thank you! :)1 answerAnswerBump0"
