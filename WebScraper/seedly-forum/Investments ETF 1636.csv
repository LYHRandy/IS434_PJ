MasterAnswered on 14 Apr 2019Honestly, any broad based market ETF in a developed economy is quite okay for retail investors, but definitely the best for beginners is the STI nikko am ETF or SSGA SPDR STI ETF, both which tracks the Straits Times Index, our top 30 market cap weighted public listed firms in the SGX. Why I say best for beginners is because it firstly is stable (blue chips, bank stocks, REITS that pay high divs with good reputation and regulation), it is domiciled in our own country, and it's trading with our own currency. So this means you will have lesser things to worry about. You can use this opportunity to learn more about funds in general when you buy into either of these low cost ETFS (of 0.30% expense ratio of entire NAV), and how the macroeconomic news of other countries and of Singapore affect the particular industries that consitutes the STI. You'll learn more about the flaws of the STI as well, with it's high weightage to financial services stocks. Then once you are ready, you could perhaps look to another stepping stone that forms the foundation of almost all investors: the US S&P 500 index ETFS! Just remember: ETFs are trackers of a particular index, and this means what it tracks determines the risk. If the ETF tracks broad market, then it is inherently low risk in a stable economy, but if the ETF tracks a high growth industry, you could be buying yourself into a high risk investment!0 comments1"
