question,"Family Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 Nov 2018How can my family keep our property?Years ago my dad bought a condo for each of his 3 kids. Our current house is under both my parents’ names. One condo is under my dad’s name, while the other 2 are under each of my siblings’ names. I just got a BTO. My brother insisted on selling the condo under his name as he wants to own a BTO in the near future. Is there any workaround so that we can keep the property and yet enable him to apply for BTO?2 answersAnswerBump0"

GeniusUpdated on 08 Nov 2018Please note that your brother will need to wait 30months after selling his condo before able to buy new HDB.While it is technically possible that u can hold the properties in a trust/company, the cost and hassle might not be worth it. I might be better to sell it and use the proceeds to fully pay your HDB and use the rest of the monies to invest for the longer term (in other assests). 0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 08 Nov 2018Its nice that your parents were forward looking enough to purchase a home for all of you while your dad could afford it. there are few methods:1) hold it in a trust/company - I am not sure but I think a sum is required to do that. if I am not wrong... someone acting on behalf of the trust have to 'buy' the condo off your brother. 2) your parents can decouple the current house under both names to just your dad's (if its a HDB then probably not possible, also not sure if he would incur stamp duties for decoupling, he would definitely incur legal fees), then your mum can take over the house under your brother's name? However do note that name transfers would also incur stamp duty up to 3% and 4% above $1million. Have to do your sums and to weigh out if it is worth the while. After selling the condo, your brother will have to wait for 30months before he can BTO. However he can purchase a resale HDB flat, just that he will not be eligible for any grants (till 30mths after disposing of the condo) and he is not eligible for a HDB loan as well (till 30 mths after disposing of the condo). 0 comments0"
