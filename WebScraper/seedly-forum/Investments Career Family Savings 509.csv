1,"Zed Xiao, Financial Planner of the Year at Financial Planning Association of SGLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 18 Sep 2019Hi. FA meaning Financial Adviser?If that is what you mean I would say not true. A good FA has the financial knowledge (not only finance PRODUCT knowledge) to help any individual. For lower-income, knowing they need protection, the FA should also come in to advise on what is the best approach to get them covered within their budget.2 comments1"
2,"Zed Xiao18 Sep 2019For investment, is true that those belong to higher income range has longer list of investment opportunity to go into but that doesn't mean lower income range is not able to grow your wealth.Zed Xiao18 Sep 2019Most important is to do budgeting on your monthly income vs expenses. This way you can save much more, start building your emergency fund first then investment. Speak to someone you are comfortable with. He/she can also go thru ur income/expense and advise you from there on."
3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2019I think this is a common problem for a lot of people. Especially in their minds.We may want to look at the reason first.(1) Middle and higher income have good positive cash flow. They can build a bigger golden ""goose"" which can lay eggs. They are not afraid to pay for advice (since that advice of maybe even $3,000) can earn them back easily from their $100,000 investment for the next 20 years.(2) Lower income usually do not have net positive cash flow, especially if expenses exceed income. In order to literally ""money grow money,"" you need something.(3) let's say we resolve the cashflow issues. Next, comes the protection element. People who bought 1 million coverage policies naturally have more discount (20% perpetual discount), and higher sum assured. While lower income buys at $100,000 coverage, but no discount. This also comes into play, the premiums paid ratio to coverage(4) lower income group may also gear towards free advice, and have less network to know the better advisors. I would suggest going to MoneyOwl to have a good chat with the advisors, as they have a social cause to help everyone. Do approach others, and see whose beliefs can align with you.(5) The main game is, increase your income, and reduce your expenses. Low income has to focus on doing better for their job and invest in skillset upgrade. That would enable them to break the cycle and have more disposable cash (nett nett after expenses and all)(6) Hard work. Singapore Social mobility is much higher than in other countries. We should take this opportunity to try to improve our own situation.I hope this helps...0 comments0"
