1) Accept the offer
2) Ask for more and risk losing the offer. If you do not foresee receiving similar offers soon, it might not be worth the risk to proceedIf it's due to other reasons (e.g. working environment, better career progression), I do not think it's worth it to negotiate if the current offer is able to meet your requirements. Also, I don't think that the final offer is likely to be far off from the initial offer.0 comments1"
