Your cash deposits are held at a Trust Account at DBS Bank while your investable cash and securities are held in a custodian account through Saxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd Source:  https://www.stashaway.sg/faq/115003871648-where-is-my-money-kept In practice, if both StashAway and Saxo go bankrupt, customers’ holdings are still safe. The fact that MAS awarded to Stashaway a full CMS license for Fund Management and that therefore they need to comply to very strict audit, compliance and minimum capital requirements should give comfort to investors.0 comments1"
