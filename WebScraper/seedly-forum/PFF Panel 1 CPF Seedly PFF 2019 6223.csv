The upsides of having a house in a mature estate is possibly much more than the costs of the additional CPF interest.I would advise to most importantly not overstretch your finances especially for a first home.Upgrade later as necessary.0 comments0

If you're looking to sell your house later (eg. many Singaporeans sell their BTOs after MOP) then the location of your house will determine how attractive it is to future buyers.0 comments0
