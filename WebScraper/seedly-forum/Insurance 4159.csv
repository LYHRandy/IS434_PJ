question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Jul 2018What are the tips on buying and selling a house without an agent?My parents still owes $150k for our 5-room hdb flat in bishan and they are both above 65yo (very little contribution to OA). They are thinking of downgrading. I do not know anything about selling or buying a flat, but I want to save the money of not hiring an agent (my parents have no savings at all atm). What should I do first? Buy then Sell or Sell then Buy.  I cant seem to find any website to help new people like me to understand the property market more!2 answersAnswerBump0"

WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jul 2018Given your situation, sell then buy seems to be a more viable option since Tee-Ming also mentioned that you still have six months before you need to move out. Selling your flat on your own would save you 10-20K worth of commission.​Most property websites require you to be a property agent to create an account, but you can list your flat for free on Carousell​Recently, our property team has put together a step-by-step guide on How to Sell Your HDB flat on Your Own, let me list down the steps below:Register your intent to sell via the HDB Resale PortalPut your flat up for sale onlineGrant your buyer the HDB Option to Purchase (OTP)Submit a resale application to HDBEndorse the resale documents via the HDB Resale PortalPay resale fees onlineAttend your HDB resale completion appointment after receiving your approval letter  ​Full disclaimer: I work for Carousell​Unbiased review for Ohmyhome: a couple I know once tried their service, their 5-room flat is located in the east and they get an average of 1-2 house viewers a week but zero offers, stopped their service in one month.0 comments1"
2,"Tee-Ming ChewLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jul 2018I have researched on selling a HDB before and here are what I found:You can't post on the major property sites like PropertyGuru, SRX and 99.co as they require you to have an agent account (which is not free) to do itYou can post on sites like Ohmyhome and DirectHome for free but do note that the views on your property will be a lot lesser than the major property sites. I heard that HDB also has it's own portal for buying and selling!Ohmyhome also do provide agent service which is by a fixed fee and not % of your resale price. Personally have not tried it so no comment on thatYou need to move out of the HDB flat within 6 months after the house is sold. However, you can request for extension (subjected to agreement from the buyer side)Hope that helps!0 comments1"
