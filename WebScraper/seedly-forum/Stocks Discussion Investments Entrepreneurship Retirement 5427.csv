1,"KAKhairudin AliLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 22 Sep 2019I started learning to invest at SGX academy. There are some free introduction courses you may choose on their website. Once you're interested in a particular investment topic, you may pay some fees to attend in-depth training. No worries, these courses don't guarantee you income like those annoying gurus you see in YouTube but at least you'll learn the basics of investments. There might be other investment courses out there but in my opinion, do some research and attend reputational places rather than being a victim of a guru scam. Good luck my friend.0 comments3"
2,"Lim Boon Tat, Mathematics at Cambridge UniversityLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 22 Sep 2019One of the undiscovered gems is that the Singapore national library board allows you to borrow ebooks. Most of the seminal texts on investing are there: you don’t even have to physically go down to the library (even though I am sure there’s one within 5km of where you are). I would start by reading 3 personal finance books (the Dummy series are pretty good). Takes you 3-4 hours to finish one. This will form a good framework to “hang” your future learning on Then follow that by general musings such as random walk down wall street, against the gods, millionaire next door etc. (all of which can be found on ebooks)By now, you should have a clear understanding of what catches your fancy: value investing, technical investing, property etc. Find 5-6 books on this and start learning. Let me know if this works for you.0 comments0"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Sep 2019Start off by getting your emergency funds and insurance protection in place before getting into investments. This is to buffer any downsides in case something goes wrong.As for where to start, consider reading up on books like millionaire teacher or rich by retirement. This can give you an idea of how to invest. You may want to look into what sort of risk profile you fit into first to give you an idea of what are the suitable instruments available that fit the risks you take. This can be done on any robo-advisory website I believe, eg StashAway.As to whether paying for an investment course is suitable, you need to identify whether your personality can stomach those risks first. Most courses out there focus on risky instruments. Take your time to learn. Go for those previews to see if what they say makes sense to you.If you want to proceed to find a mentor, does that mentor's personality resonate with you and your goals? What's his track record? How is the community he is building? Is he genuine or just a rah-rah person? Is he approachable to help you or just leaves you in the lurch or delegate's others to assist? I've personally paid for a number of courses over the years and my current mentor's personality and investment philosophy resonates with my end goal. Go for the previews and listen. Ask around and not just the successful students. Find the ones who join but somehow didn't manage to succeed. Ask them why. This will give you a balanced view of the mentor and the course to help you come to a decision.Hope this helps and all the best.0 comments0"
