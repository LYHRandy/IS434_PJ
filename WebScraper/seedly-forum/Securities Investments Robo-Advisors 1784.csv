1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 16 May 2019I would still choose to diversify my portfolio accordingly ie. Not put 100% of my investment capital solely into robo advisors. Not the norm, but sometimes it's fun to invest in something based on your evaluation process, to see how the investment turns out.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019I've written my thoughts here:  https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/shots-fired-march End of the day, they're not going to make you particular large sums of money. They also claim flexibility and liquidity and investing from your home - which contrary to popular belief are not good things for long term investors. The second question is about trust  - which is yes. There is nothing dishonest or particularly risky about a roboadvisor compared to most general investments out there. I wouldn't put money there simply due to the yield being capped - but trust is not an issue.You can always drop me a message if you'd like a higher yield.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
