God of WisdomUpdated on 03 Jul 2019It is a Regular Savings Plan (“RSP”) that allows you to invest via a GIRO arrangement on a monthly basis. You can choose either invest in the Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF, or the ABF Singapore Bond Fund, from a minimum of $100/mth. Units will be bought in on a regular basis for you. Do consider your risk appetite, your investment horizon, as well as the costs of investing.More information is available here, and you should take some time read them before deciding if this is for you:https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/investments/investing-in-funds/invest-saver3 comments4"
2,"See all 3 comments Jared Ho01 Jul 2019Also, how is this different from investing in Singapore savings bond? Thanks in advanceElijah Lee03 Jul 2019I personally don't do RSP this way, but if you want to set aside a monthly amount, please note the cost of investing (i.e. how much of your monthly amount is going to costs and fees). Keep it low (<1% is a good gauge)and also the amount should not be a significant portion of your free cash flow.

Lastly, SSBs are guaranteed. So they cannot be compared to investments."

MasterAnswered on 02 Jul 2019I just started on this with Nikko sti etf .. meant to be for a Long term investment via dca..as per any investment, there is no guarantee of returns but you have to weigh your risk appetite and ability to sustain this over a Long enough period to make the costs meaningful. Gains will not be immediate as we cannot time the market.
also how “good“ a return can be subjective according to various investment goals that you have. Eg some are happy with the 2% almost risk free interests from ssb, some don’t think it’s good enough if the returns cannot beat inflations. For me, anything Beats the paltry 0.05% interests given by standard bank savings account.in fact, one of the reasons I try this is because I am trying to get an extra 0.3% interest in my Dbs multiplier account for fulfilling the investment category.0 comments0"
