MasterAnswered on 22 Aug 2019It's likely done by the Credit Counselling Singapore if I am not wrong.But freeze interest is seldom heard of because the bank still needs to earn interest revenue.For consolidation under one bill, it is negotiated with 1 creditor which takes up all the debt but earns the interest from the big debt that was consolidated.0 comments0"
