1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019Hi! Building upon the previous response by Ms Sonone, it is highly advisable to not only focus on a particular firm's specific news, but also about the entire industry as a whole, and global macroeconomic news as well that generally affects all sectors of the market. For example, say you are looking into the Technological Industry, especially with regards to Electric Vehicles, thus zooming into a popular hot stock, Tesla (TSLA). Not only does the consumer reports bringing into question TSLA's Model 3 reliability negatively affect investor sentiments and thus stock price, which has fallen by about 2.7%, infrastructural changes for the support of EVs on roads, as well as the US- China Trade War, which has placed tariffs on automobiles shipped from US to China have all contributed to the ups and downs of TSLA's story.It is essential that we are always up to date with the current news, as in finance, information is king. With the speed of dessimination of information in this age, one or 2 hours of delay can evaporate potential gains, or cause huge losses. However, Warren Buffet says, "" i do not know when to buy a stock, but I do know what stock to buy."" Understanding the value of the firm, industry and country you are investing is arguably the most important factor. Doing your due diligence in ensuring you are making informed investing decision will more likely allow you to pick stock winners, which will survive any ups and downs in the economy, and allow you to reap gains in the long term!0 comments0"
