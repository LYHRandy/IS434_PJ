question,"Property EC Condominium Condominium Family Asked by Nelly ZackyAsked 2w agoAdvice needed on purchasing another property in 5 years time?Hi, any realtors here? I’d need a piece of advice for current EC to upgrade it to another condo but in a centralised area. How much does each couple need to earn? Would it be possible if my husband is the only working in the family but earning $4K monthly but I’m not working? Or if I’m working and earning only $2500 monthly with him $4K monthly would it be possible to get a central location condo that’s affordable? Please advise! Thanks a lot!2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"SLSamuel Lee, Financial Planner at Advisor Alliance Group (AIA)Level 3. WonderkidAnswered 2w agoHello,Based on the facts stated here, I would not recommend you upgrading to a condo. Based on a rough estimate of a central condo and your monthly income.Some details required:Have you achieved your Minimum Occupation Period for your EC?Have you paid off your EC? If not, what are the current details with regards to your ECWhat size and location of the condo are you looking at?How about your current cash liquidity? Even with insufficient cash flow a centralised condo is possible with other sources of capital to supplement your income.Do get back to me so I can answer this clearer!1 comment1"

3,"Peko PekoLevel 1. FreshieUpdated 1w agoNot an agent or any sort of sales but speaking as someone who just bought a private property. Without going into too much detail on what your current finances are, I suggest you do some homework first so that you can be more precise. Quite hard to predict what your family earning potential will be like in 5 years also. Steps:
1) download properly guru app.
2) input the preferred location and size of the property. 
3) choose a few properties from there and take the prices 
4) go to the loan calculator function and input fields
5) you will have your answer if you can afford it.You also need to bear in mind monthly maintenance fees that are proportional to size/facilities of development and size of your unit (could be anything from 300-800 or more).At the point of buying, stamp duty, legal fees and a bunch of other misc fees etc mean you also need to have a handsome amount of cash at hand to pay for those.0 comments0"
