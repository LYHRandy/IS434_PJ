You can only invest anything above the 20k you need to set aside.For CPFIS funds, there are only about 60+ and you can honestly find the best long term performing with just the fingers available on your hands.Constructing a globally diversified portfolio of about 5 to 6 funds are not that hard to achieve using these available funds. I do recommend you to look at the non ILP products in the market, and buy direct funds either through an investment platform or DIY using FSMOne. Plus, it's getting cheaper. Currently the maximum sales charge an FA can charge you is 1.5% which will drop to 0% in Oct 2019, and a max wrap fee of 0.7% which will drop to 0.4% at the same time.0 comments1"
2,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018There are 2 parts to this question which I will answer in parts.Usefulness of CPFIS. I cannot share advice on what you should do, but I can share what I have done. First, I have set aside money from OA to SA. Thereafter, I set aside as much as I could to top up my SA to the FRS level. This formed my financial safety net. Thereafter, I invested into Index Funds approved by CPFIS. Do note that is a limit on what can be used in the CPF-OAUsefulness of financial planners. This is a blanket statement, but I generally feel that CPFIS, if I am just buying index funds and buying crashes, I wonâ€™t rely on a financial planner. I generally do not think that financial planners can beat the performance of index funds and I do not need financial planners to help me become rich, but instead I rely upon them for my protection needs (insurance)0 comments0"
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Nov 2018Personally, I do not advise taking your CPF monies into CPFIS.OA earns 2.5% abd SA 4%. For the first $60k in your CPF combined balance (with only up to $20k max from OA), the monies will earn an extra 1%. If you are still young, u will not be near the limit yet. Your monies are earning guaranteed interest rate (attractive returns) Risk-free, regardless of market conditions.In fact, as part of retirement planning, I advocate topping up your special account. You will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-5% interest yearly guaranteed.Chat me up on my fb if you like to discuss further.0 comments0"
