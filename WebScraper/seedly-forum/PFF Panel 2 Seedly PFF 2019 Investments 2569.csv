1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019I have been following the gaming industry quite closely.Indeed people have caught on to the multi billion dollar gaming industry in recent years, and its expected to continuously be a relevant tech sector in years to come.The success of fortnite- especially its business model innovation of a freemium yet strong revenue generation has turned conventional gaming model on its head.Many Studios like $ACTVI have tried and failed with their own versions of battle royales. So far Apex legends has been the only game to come anywhere close. So, No. I donâ€™t believe the key to success lies rehashing Battle Royale-esque games. In fact gamers today demand more than ever, but yet show willingness to splurge on games they deem worthy. The gaming landscape is constantly changing and much more complicated than that.0 comments1"
