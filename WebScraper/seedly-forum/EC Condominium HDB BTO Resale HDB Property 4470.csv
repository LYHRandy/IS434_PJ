question,"EC Condominium HDB BTO Resale HDB Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Sep 2018First-time buyers here - does it make economic sense to skip HDBs and go for an EC or Condo if we can afford it?Does it make economic sense to jump directly to an EC or Condo if we can afford it? Instead of getting a BTO/resale and upgrading in the future.We are first-time buyers and have been looking at resale flats but everything is grossly overpriced. No viable BTOs are available, so we're considering going straight to an EC/Condo.Also taking into consideration the plunging values of HDB flats. Thank you and we're looking forward to hearing your expert advice and opinions!https://bit.ly/2N0sciG5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Sep 2018Yes. Which is why EC was setup for similar situations like yours that can afford better and wants more.​Skipping multiple route of 5 years MOP each for BTO then Resale then EC makes sense since every stop before next upgrade needs to stay for at least 5 years MOP, not to mentioned all the stamp fees, legal fees, agent fees, any SSD, renovations & fixture and furnishings etc.​So it's like investing in the right locations EC gets you higher growth one shot rather than having to take the risks of buy BTO, sell BTO, but resell and sell resell with in between risks of not making enough $ for next upgrade plus all the cost above etc.​Your considerations should be on either EC or Private Condo. With EC also having 5 years MOP before you can rent out or sell to locals and 10 years later to sell to open market like private condo.​Read here for more info:https://www.executivecondos.com.sg/faq/0 comments2"
2,"Nicholas Woon, Marketing Director at ERA Realty Network Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 25 Sep 2018Yes, go for EC if you can afford it because you would make more capital appreciation with EC than resale HDBs since the latter has been stagnant or slightly decreasing in price for the last few years. I would advise EC to condo so you don't miss out on the grants (although EC would still make more economic sense without the grants). 0 comments1"
