I do think that a deeper analysis is probably more necessary to find out if this share is a good buy by studying their growth profile.

EBITDA and Gross Profit margin look bad, but EBIT and net profit seem alright due to the low depreciation and amortization that they have. Year on Year, the earnings have improved by quite a big jump as well. Overall, financials look like they have been improving year on year. Balance SheetThe firm's balance sheet looks quite good too! Short-term liquidity looks quite high. Moreover, the firm does not hold much debt, which suggests that more cashflows can be left for shareholders. However, it also does seem that short-term liquidity had slowly worsened over the years.CashflowsA whole, the firm's cash flows look pretty good. This is evidenced by their good free cash flow as % of sales, while cash flows have also improved over the years as well.

This is evidenced by their high free cash flow to equity and zero debt levels, as well as the relatively high cash balance they have. Efficiency MetricsThe firm looks quite efficient as well, base on the different efficiency metrics. Moreover, these metrics had also improved over time.
