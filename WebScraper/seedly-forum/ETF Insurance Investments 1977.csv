1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019ILPs invest in unit trusts or sub funds which are not actively traded. You will need to submit a request to buy or sell your holdings and this usually takes 2 working days to process. You will not know the full extend of the stocks being held in the fund as well.Etfs on other hand are traded on a stock exchange. The price is fully transparent, and you will know what are being held in the fund. Fees wise etfs have a superior advantage over ILPs, as it is much lower.Over the long term, investing in etfs will be better as the lower fees will not eat up a big portion of the profits as compared to ILPs. Hope this helps0 comments0"

But rather than push the value of portfolios higher over the long run, fees do the exact opposite. They eat away at the value of your portfolio.Anyway, no sane investors will buy an ILP for investment. It is totally nonsense.0 comments0"

ILP do things for you at a higher cost and they offer active and passive managed funds. ETFs are listed on stock exchanges, need to do research on which ETFs you prefer, are usually passive managed and have lower cost.0 comments0"
