1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019 i bought one and using. It was good at the start but after that the quality no good.The back support pillow straps became loose so the back support pillow keeps slipping down.The leather peels off after 2 years for mine. So now the chair looks damn ugly. And I am not a heavy user, only use at night and weekends. If you ask me if I will buy again. The answer is no. It is good for that few months to a year but after that the chair starts to deteriorate. And it has passed the warranty so cannot repair.2 comments2"

3,"Ng Wei En, Bsc(Information Systems) at Singapore Management University Level 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey Kenneth! I have a SecretLab Omega chair at home. Its really comfortable and the build quality is solid(The frame and casters(wheels) are super sturdy). You also have the ability to recline and lock the reclining position for a quick power nap. The armrest is also fully adjustable for height and left/right, front/back.  Definitely a worthy investment! 1 comment2"

Omega version.There are other common reasons which are available in many chairs but the below are winning factors.Key reasons.Solid feel when seated. I am 1.8 m and 90 kg.Leather feels good but needs air con. Then again, i can no longer stay in non air con so this is negligible.Wheels are sturdy. It's the large PU casters.
This is important.
Larger easier to roll and last longer.
The smaller versions uses the small wheels and different materials which for me broke within 2 years.Wheelbase has rounded edges and is 1 solid piece.
Some chairs is multiple piece joined which may fall apart.
Some chairs have plastic covers which if fall off reveals sharp edges. Got cut before.
Some chairs are plain sharp edges. The designer needs to be shot.0 comments1"
