WonderkidAnswered on 14 Aug 2018Such treatment maybe considered as cosmetic, and if so, it is not insurable.If the doctor can explain why such treatment is medically necessary, it can be covered.However, if the person already has such a condition, then obviously it will not be covered, under exclusion of pre-existing conditions clause.â€‹0 comments0"
