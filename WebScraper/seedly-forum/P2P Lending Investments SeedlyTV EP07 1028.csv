1,"HC TangLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I think P2P is a good choice. Though is a high risk, but I find it a good alternative that is easy and fuss free (with funding society FS mobile apps).​Duration:  Started about a year agoTotal Investment: Put in 1k then added 2k, After receiving my principal back, I'll use it to re-invest back to other loans. Product Type:  it has 3 types: (1) Term Loans (2) Invoice investing (3) Property Backed.  Tenure; Shortest about 30 or 45 days to 1 year tenure. ​How to invest: With FS, it will send 1 to 3 emails few times a week about a loan, we just use the auto bot setting to invest (based on round roulette methods determine by the company's algorithm, everyone take turns). So after receiving the email, I'll check my FS app, see how much I got allocated, or not being allocate at all. Calculate the interest to see if i'm keen, check the loan type / tenure / risk, then decide if I want to continue or op out. ​Succes Rate: 100% (Never had a loan defaulted on me but does encounter delayed payment, with additional interest! So it's a bonus!) Returns: 2.35% so far. ​P/S: P2P loan is still rated as High risk, but I think it's quite alright if we only limit to a small amount that has no harm losing in the worst case scenario, such as 1 to 3k. It is a good experience and learning point also! ​Maybe some day it will be even more profitable. For the time being, it is still a small nice to have investment tools. ​Read about my review here:  https://seedly.sg/reviews/p2p-lending/funding-societies?rid=12#reviews&utm_source=review_share&utm_medium=internal ​And others: https://seedly.sg/reviews/p2p-lending​Cheers! 2 comments5"

This is because the shortest turnaround of P2P loan (Invoice financing) is 30 days wh... (more)"

So far I put in a 1k investment to try it out... so it was on this thing called Auto-invest which allows the machine to automatically invest $100 into 10 different companies. Around 3 of them have returned so far... total yield projected to be around 5 to 6% via funding societies. As mentioned below by Ming Feng, you can just head over to the reviews site to compare as well~! :) 0 comments4"

Personally, I'll look at the financials on loans and decide whether to invest in that issue. Favour invoice financing over business term financing due to most BTF usage are working capital and I regard it as risker. 0 comments1"
5,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Sep 2018P2P is considered as a high risk investment, thus providing attractive returns as well. Thus, do diversify your portfolio by participating/investing in multiple loans to reduce your losses should a company default on their payment. Note that it is a form of illiquid investment as your money is locked in for the duration of the loan tenture. 0 comments1"

Love the user interface for both. Had no problem with Funding Societies. Easy to use. As for MoolahSense, I had a session with one of their guys. Awesome stuff too, and we are seeing some changes for Moolahsense with the most recent being reducing their minimum amount for $100. 
Exciting space to keep a lookout for, for sure.
Do take note that P2P lending is a high-risk investment plus it is subjected to tax. Nevertheless, quite a good experience with funding societies. CoAssets and Minterest are a bunch of interesting guys too!Do check out real user reviews here. Nothing beats reading about experienced investors' experience in the space.
