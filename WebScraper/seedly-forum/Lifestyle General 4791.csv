My friend has burpple while I have Entertainer.We tried to do that before but its one claim per table only. So unless you guys split into two different table, it will be unlikely to stack. Even if you split the bill, the approval got to come from the in-charge too. We must remember they are running a business and there must be profits to pay their staffs, rent, etc.0 comments2"
