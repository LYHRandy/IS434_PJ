Depending on the contract wording the death benefit may pay out or the policy may be void and the premiums paid will be 'refunded' to the estate. Need to fall back on the contract wording for claims assessment. 0 comments1"

But please read the product summary of your policy, it's usually stated in the first few points.0 comments0"
