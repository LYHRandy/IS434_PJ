1,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 05 Jun 2019Of course you save money on ecommerce online shopping.There is a simple reason - RENTAL.I have online health store like Manuka Honey Or Elderly Diapers, Ensure Glucerna Jevity Milk or even just Pet Food like dog treatsI can reduce the price that is lower than retail stores because I am not paying high rental for mall space. I am not paying high salary for retail assistants to help. I am not paying utility, renovation, etc for shop. Warehouse space is so much cheaper, and warehouse assistants are easier to find.Its the same in overseas, you can easily find Baby Sling Wrap, Magnetic Blocks, Camping Hammocks in USA whereas they will costs 50% more in stores.Even for service products like insurance, go online and find General Insurance in Singapore. Its the same theory. Or a Scrap car financing business. They are all moving ONLINE.The insurance broker, agency, advisors whatsoever need to pay less rent for retail shop, or commercial office space etc so they can still go out there and offer better pricing to the consumers.In fact we are at Seedly now reading great stuff about financial stuff, because it is so much easier to read online than to turn to Straits Times and try to figure out whatever they dump in front of us. Its just easier to google on Seedly to find the answer we want.Digital make stuff cheaper.Nowadays when I have an expensive stuff to buy, I will go Lazada, Shopee, Qoo10 or just google online for good offers to spend my hard earn money. Leaving more for investment or savings.0 comments4"

4,"Ablah KethuLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I feel your question should also add time because everything that we should also combine with the time. As in what time you have earned that. I definitely save a good amount comparatively online than offline shopping. If the same offer going on in online and offline then i will definitely opt to buy that in online than offline because here my advantage resides in my comfort and the other things that i save from it like time, energy and other.​Whereas coming to the online shopping you will find more options way and searching and finding the right availability you will only get in online than offline. Searching for hours if time sitting at one place through multiple stores is allowed but searching visiting multiple stores ad roaming in multiple stores not only eat your valuable time but also takes away a lot of things that you save for your sake so i personally feel that online shopping is lot better than offline.​This is why whenever i shop i only opt to check the needed collection and then for the stores offering that in best discounts for me and then will proceed. In all this process Rezeem helps me a lot in the way of checking coupons, offers, promo codes and get that product easily at price.1 comment1"

6,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2018It'll depend on what you are shopping for. For books, it's definitely cheaper to get it off book depository or amazon. Unless it's locally published. Same for movies and music cds. 0 comments1"
7,"Jay LiuLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Sep 2018Definitely online. Wait for deals like the recent 9.9 on Lazada and whack all things you want to buy.
Bought 2 logitech z333 speaker(buy 1 get 1 free)  for $58(RTP 1 for $109). Could list the another one on carousell for $50 and pray someone would buy it but I guess I'm giving my sister. 
What's better shopping online is that they ship to your doorstep. Avoid human traffic, don't have to carry and take bus home, save time. 0 comments1"

Collect until you meet the minimum for free delivery.​If you can, always wait for sale or promotions, like 9/9 and 11/11 sales. ​​​​0 comments1"

12,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Answer is depends​online shopping is convenient but lately I have bought a washing machine 80 dollars cheaper in store compared to buying online.​That is better even after factoring in Shopback + liveup membership rebates​I would recommend doing extensive research between online and in person0 comments0"
13,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018save more online because of discount, discount code, shopback, credit card cash rebate etcThere's places like carousell / gumtree and fb forum selling brand new stuff at great discount.​I do most shopping online. Some brands if there's physical shop presence, you can go try their sizing before buy online from other online marchant. This will reduce sizing mistake, colour diff of pic vs actual items. ​Some risk for online purchase vs physical shop: Actual item quality differ from what it describe online Groceries may not be so fresh, but if you buy what you have bought before and if is ok the first time, it is quite safe to continue buying the same thing. ​​0 comments0"
14,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018It really depends whether there is a promotion or sales. At the end of the day, you have to do your research. Compare prices online and offline. 0 comments0"
15,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Sep 2018With promo codes, cashback, online sales etc., shopping online is usually cheaper. Personally, I prefer to shop online as I can get to compare both products and prices from the different sellers on the go and from the comfort of my home. However, it can be a hassle if the item that you purchased does not fit (apparels) or is faulty (electronics) as you'll have to exchange it either physically (defeats the purpose of online shopping) or through return mailing (long waiting time).0 comments0"
16,"Ng Jun SiangLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Also consider the time and cost of travel, vs the ease or difficulty of arranging for delivery. I usually buy items online if I can unless1) I know it will be too bulky to ship cheaply
2) I need to see it to know if it will fit/last, e.g. clothes
3) I'm not too clear what I want and it's easier to ask an experienced salesperson (e.g. reno lighting)1 comment0"
17,"Leong Wen Fong17 Sep 2018Oh that's a pretty good thought flow, Some things are just too much of a hassle to bring back from the shop"
