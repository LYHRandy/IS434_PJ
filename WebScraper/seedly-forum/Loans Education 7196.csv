1,"Andrew Fong, Associate Partner at St. James's Place Wealth ManagementLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Nov 2018It really depends on your financial situation & outlook. The benefit of a loan would be that it doesn't take away a chunk of your savings built up. But if you really do not foresee a situation coming up where you might need that lump sum, then just pay it off without a loan.0 comments1"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Nov 2018Will you be able to invest your own funds to achieve a better yield as compared to the interest rate of the loan? If yes then consider taking up the loan. 0 comments0"
4,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 19 Nov 2018No, dont take a loan unnecessarily. Why pay the interests cost. Typical private uni u only need to pay term by term. So u will not need to come out with the full lump sum at the onset.  0 comments0"
5,"Tiffany SQLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Nov 2018Let say it cost $35k for the entire uni fees. And if you take a loan, the interest rate is about 5%. You probably need to consider the following:1) can this 35k provide you better dividend or investment returns of more than 5%?2) do you have any other loans/debts to pay off? Or any big ticket items that u foresee u need? 3) if this 35k will only be left in the bank for 0.05% is better to just pay up the uni fees than to get a loan.Hope this helps ðŸ˜„0 comments0"
