1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 18 Jun 2019There's no definite correct answer. You can choose 30% Group Insurance 70% Private. 50|50. Or max out Group Term and get Private only if you need more. I went for all private term. Kept the Group Term to the minimum of 100k. However, one suggestion is to skip out on the Living Care Plus (ECI) rider. Doesn't cover enough conditions. 10 as compared to over 100 via private ECI policies.1 comment7"

3,"Siow Nan, Electrical And Computer Engineering at NusLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Jun 2019My ratio is 33% private vs 67% group term.. mainly due to group term being much more affordable for a higher coverage quantum. Besides it covers children below the age of 10 as well.rather than ratio, better to get covered in the right quantum for your current needs and review them time after time.5 comments4"
4,"See all 5 comments Siow Nan10 Jun 2019I maxed up the group term coverage also because it is affordable and why not do it while I am younger and healthier without any conditions? It is easier to reduce coverage later on if you feel that the premiums are too much of a burden, than to try increasing your coverage later on when you are older or starts to have pre existing conditions that will disqualify you from increasing coverageJansen Ng11 Jun 2019Cool stuffüëç Thanks for sharing:)"
