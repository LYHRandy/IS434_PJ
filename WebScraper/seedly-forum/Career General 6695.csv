1,"Constance Ho, HR professional at (various industries)Level 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Aug 2018Those are all very different fields, with many specialised sub-fields.​Some questions to ask yourself:What are you good at? What do you want to get better at?What elements of these subjects/professions do you like or not like, and why?How much time do you want to spend studying? (and can you afford it?)Does your school have cross-faculty options, or can you do a Minor in one/more of these subjects?What internship opportunities are open to you? ​If you can, speak with people who are working in the areas you are interested in and ask them lots of questions about their jobs and how they got to where they are. And then, when you've done all you can, go with your gut and trust that the dots will connect.​I majored in Life Sciences, minored in English Linguistics/Literature, and ended up working in HR (>10years), lol. 0 comments1"
