I think so if is : Asset rich cash poor so no extra $ at the moment to enjoy much. ‚ÄãHowever , I think its more of a choice. One can be worth tens of billions but still jusr drive a normal Honda Accura ( mark zukerberg).  ‚ÄãOne can be in debts and making 20k salary but all the deductions, expenses and lavish lifestyle to maaintain a matching front still cost him/her to have  no cash / no savings left monthly and live pay cheque to pay cheque. ‚ÄãOnly one who optimizes what he/she has now,  plan and invest for future will truly be rich, physically and mentally üòÅüòâ0 comments0"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Mm poor is very subjective. If you meant that the rich just chase after more riches and ignore other aspects of their lives, family and health, then it's poor indeed. On the flip side, if the rich manage to stay rich while also enabling better lives for the less fortunate, won't that be something better?0 comments0"

I like the saying that some rich people are so poor, that the only thing they have is money. It really depends on what you look for in life. ‚ÄãIf you look for achievements and success, then the rich to you are those who have great achievements.‚ÄãIf you look for money, then you will always look at those richer than you, and wish you were them.‚ÄãIf you look for love, then your treasure is found in one that will love you back. (get a dog)‚ÄãIf you are looking for legacy, then you your riches are in building something that you know will last beyond your generation.‚ÄãIf you look for significance, then you will look at the number of people whom you can help, and will go on to helping other people in their lives.‚ÄãWhich brings us to Seedly. It's full of people who are willing to help others at no cost, and give unbiased views on products!‚ÄãYou ask: Are the rich poor?I ask you: What do you look to be rich in?0 comments0"
