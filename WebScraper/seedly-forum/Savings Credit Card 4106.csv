1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 21 Jun 2019Hey Minghui!Thanks for the question! We've got an article breaking down the best cashback credit cards based on different types of expenditure here: https://blog.seedly.sg/best-cashback-credit-cards/#big%20ticketMore importantly, you should determine the following:1) How much do you spend every month on average? This helps determine whether you can hit the min. spend for some of the cards.2) What's the proportion of your different types of spending? E.g. mostly spent on eating out OR mostly spent on transport .etc. This helps determine if the cashback rates for the different types of spending (e.g. 8% dining, 3% grocery) are satisfactory based on your expenditure behaviour. Also, if most of your spending is on the exempted expenditure, you might not get to qualify for the cashback too so do read the T&Cs!My personal recommendation would be UOB YOLO & POSB Everyday Card. They both have pretty decent cashback rates for shopping & dining out, which comprises the main bulk of my expenditure. I hope this helps! :-)1 comment2"

WizardUpdated on 21 Jun 2019It's quite a complex games depends on your spending nature, monthly spending amount , and the card min spending and cash back category caps. As each card has very refined T&C, exclusion clause. To find the best cash back card , you need to know your spending. 1) Find the last 2 months all the credit card bill online , download them to CSV format and open in Excel. Next group each transaction according to category like online shopping , dining , travel and transport and sum each category total. Note on the monthly total spend. 2) With that you will know your monthly total spend to see if you can hit the credit card min spend for cash  back, total of each category (online shopping , dining , travel and transport). 3) Next go to singsaver , GoBear or Moneysmart to check the best cash back card , then go to each card website to check the details T&C , to see if your figure in (2) is able to meet the card T&C to get the cash back and possible cash back amount. If you're willing to do the above 3 steps , you'll be able to find the best cash back suited for your lifestyle. If the deals no good , suggest to try milescard instead to get miles for travel üòÉ2 comments2"
