1,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For CIMB VISA, insurance premiums is excluded from cashback.Based on their t&c, it should be able to add for the min spend. But it would be good to double confirm with the customer service officer (CSO). Below is extracted from their terms and conditions:Cash advance fees, gambling related transactions, quasi-cash transactions, late payment or interest charges, fees payable to the bank for transfer of any debit balance or any other credit card to a Card, any other interest, fees and charges imposed by the Bank from time to time, balance and/or funds transfer to and from Card Account, and any credit card transactions that was subsequently cancelled, voided or reversed for any reason will not be counted towards fulfilling the minimum monthly spend.https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/content/dam/cimbsingapore/personal/cards/terms-and-conditions/tnc-visa-signature-20181018.PDF1 comment1"
