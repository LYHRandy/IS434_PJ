1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Oct 2018Hmm, depends on the reason she is doing Grab. If it is just to cover some costs and to be able to use the car, then sure! If it is to earn some side income, then I strongly suggest you think of another way.I have done Grab before, and just to cover the costs, you have to really work at all the peak hours to ensure that you get the incentives, and then to earn a little bit of cash. Even as a student I have driven up to 10 hours a day for a short window of time, and it can really be torture, and it wasn't as if the amount I earned was fantastic either.In addition to petrol, parking, servicing costs (or rental) etc, you still ahve to think about the cost of getting a PDVL. Getting a PDVL requires you to attend a full day course, as well as take a test on a separate day (fees can be claimed by SkillsFuture/Grab). The test is not a breeze either, and there are many who failed more than once.If you are really just doing this because you need the car anyway, and this is just to cover some costs, and to occupy yourself a little bit, then consider driving hitch, which does not require a PDVL (unless you are driving a rental) and you can pick and choose your timing and ""clients"" as well.0 comments3"
2,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Apr 2019If you're buying the car so your wife can drive grab it might not be worth it. Reason being that your wife will not drive the whole day since it's only for part time and unless you have a use for it; the car will be idling away. It might be cheaper to rent a car that way and share it with another driver then take shift so it's more cost efficient.Also, taking care of a child is not easy so she won't be able to drive that often and it is going to be a lifestyle adjustment. Why burden yourself with a liability (depreciating one no less) before anything else? Try to check out online rental; believe you can find something worthwhile.0 comments0"
3,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Oct 2018Rent better i think. Car is a liability. Not worth to buy just for doing Grab part time. Maybe you should consider investing. You can either do it yourself or use robo advisors. Multiply your money for your future.0 comments0"
4,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If the main reason for purchasing the car is because you/your family needs it, then it might be viable for your wife to drive part time with Grab to earn additional income. But if it is so that she can use the car to drive for Grab part time, then it might not be very wise to do so. Reasons being you'll be clocking up quite a lot of milleage resulting in faster & higher wear and tear, thus higher maintenance and servicing costs. Driving on the road for long hours also results in fatigue and higher chance of getting into a road accident, touchwood. I'm following some groups on Facebook with PHV drivers inside and I understand that their earnings dipped quite a lot after Uber left the Singapore (SEA) market. In addition, drivers who lease cars from Grab preferred rental partners might have a higher chance of getting a ping/call/booking. Go-Jek is coming into the Singapore market soon so hopefully things will become better1 comment0"
