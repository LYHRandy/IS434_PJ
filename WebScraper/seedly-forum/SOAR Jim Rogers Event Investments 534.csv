Grand MasterUpdated on 18 Sep 2019I read an article on Donald Trump on where his critics are saying he is not reaching his end-goals on the trade war because he miscalculated how China can react.The article then continues and proposed:- What if the trade war IS THE END GOAL.Donald has no intention of ending the war. He already reached the end goal.Politically, it is helping him a lot. Economically, it is a short term pain for the USA economy, but even those suffering from it believe it is good in the long term to gain more concession from a ""bully"" that has stolen America's technology, ideas, and undercut workers.Not taking a side here, but is in tune with what I think:-Trade war gonna last for couple more years =)I will continue buying in the stock markets. pick up cheap stuff, stay for the long term =)1 comment1"
