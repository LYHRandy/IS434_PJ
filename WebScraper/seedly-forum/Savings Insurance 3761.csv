question,"Savings Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Jun 2019Is there anyone who knows about Pruwealth? Could you explain the part about the bonuses pls?My financial planner from Prudential recently introduced me to Pruwealth, and I read through the documents he gave me and found it to be a rather decent product, just that I do not quite understand the bonuses part, such as reversionary and accumulated reversionary, was wondering if someone could shed some light about it here so I can better understand it. And was wondering if Prudential has adjusted its payout rate over the years, as well as the other companies too.1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 27 Jun 2019Why don't you ask your Prudential advisor to explain the bonuses to you? You're paying for his/her advice.But nonetheless, endowment policies pay out bonuses in two ways, Reversionary Bonus (RB) and Terminal Bonus (TB).RB is paid throughout the policy term and once declared it is guaranteed while TB is paid upon surrender, death, or maturity of the policy.RB is determined by a dollar figure per $1000 sum assured. This will be stated in the product summary. It may also come with a compounded RB bonus.
TB is determined by a % of Accumulated RB already paid on the policy.You'll also need to note that bonuses paid out can be affected by the participating fund performance of the policy/insurer and the expense ratio of the fund. If the par fund does very well, you can even get more than what was projected.
Another thing to note is smoothing of bonuses. Even when there are years of bad performance, the insurer can still pay full bonuses on a product because they saved some returns from years that have done very well.
And Prudential's par fund returns have been one of the highest in Singapore because they employ a slightly more aggressive portfolio than almost every other insurer. This can be seen from the highest gain and loss right after and during a recession.All in all, this still barely scratches the surface of endowment policies as I can go into capital reserve requirements, shareholders to policyholders dividends to bonuses ratios which all play a part.
So do clarify with your advisor.0 comments2"
