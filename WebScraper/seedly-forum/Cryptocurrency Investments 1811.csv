1,"Kenneth FongLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019That's a good question, and a more common one than you might think.TL;DR: Making Sense of Blockchain and CryptocurrencyBlockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency, amongst many other things.Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, such as the SGD for example. Except that it's digital and uses sophisticated encryption techniques to govern the creation of individual monetary units as well as to verify the transfer of these units. The most well-known cryptocurrency is... You guessed it: Bitcoin.A Bit More About BlockchainA blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable (unchangeable over time) record of data that is managed by a cluster of computers, that are not owned by any single entity.Each 'block' of data is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles aka the 'chain', hence the name blockchain.So... What's So Special About Blockchain?1) Since a blockchain network is a shared and immutable ledger, the info is open to anyone and everyone to see.As a result, everyone who is involved is accountable for their actions, and there's really NO NEED FOR A CENTRAL AUTHORITY to govern it - which is also why MAS is having a field day trying to regulate cryptocurrency.2) There is no transaction cost. There'll still be infrastructure costs involved though.So why is there no transaction cost? Simple. It's all data, there's no middle man or third party involved who needs to be paid.When one party makes a transaction, it initiates a process by creating a 'block' of data. This block is verified by thousands or even millions of computers in a network.Once the verified block is added to the 'chain' and stored on the network, it creates a unique record with a unique history. To falsify one record means falsifying millions of records across the millions of computers in the network - and that's virtually impossible.Why Should Companies Like Airbnb Be Afraid Of Blockchain?For Airbnb, we book rooms via an app or their website. They take a cut for ""match-making"" the host to a renter. And when we pay for the transaction, the credit card company takes a cut as well.With blockchain, we can save on credit card processing fees and even move the entire room/home booking process off Airbnb.Here's how.The two parties in the transaction are the host and the renter.The room is the 'block', which will be added to a room blockchain. Just as a monetary transaction on blockchain is unique, your booking of the room between the host and you (the renter) is also unique, verifiable, and cannot be falsified.Best of all, this process is free.Not only can blockchain transfer and store ""money"", but it can also replace all processes and business models which rely on charging a small fee for a transaction.If you want to read up more on cryptocurrency, Seedly has written a pretty good article on it: https://blog.seedly.sg/a-quick-singaporeans-guide-to-cryptocurrencies-and-factors-affecting-the-price/1 comment6"
