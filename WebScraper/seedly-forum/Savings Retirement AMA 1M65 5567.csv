3,"DeleteEditYixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Nov 2018This will be part of estate planning (how to distribute your assets), rather than retirement planning. Although consideration can be given to estate planning during retirement planning. Nominate now if you have the time. And again after u are married. (If divorced, nominate again) Then again when your children are of adulthood. The nomination becomes void upon marriage and remarriage. Nomination is NOT voided upon divorce, so one might want to renominate unless they which to give their ex-spouse the money. 0 comments0"

Our CPF normally forms a sizeable part of our wealth.I have previously shared an article on Dollars and Sense on Estate Planning which you may read here: https://dollarsandsense.sg/sq368-plane-fire-estate-planning-done/0 comments0"
