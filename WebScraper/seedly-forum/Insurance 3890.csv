2,"Phua Wei Jun, Wealth Manager at Aviva Financial AdvisersLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 11 Mar 2019Since your concern is on her medical expenses, your first priority would be to upgrade her hospitalisation shield plan to a maximum % coverage and ward class that your budget permits. The cost of the plan typically increases with age and health care inflation, so do take note on this. Though downgrading to a lower ward class is possible without any health underwriting required.But of course, if your mum has any existing medical condition, DO NOT switch to a different insurance company if the existing company provide coverage for that condition. Meaning, the current plan was bought when your mum was in 100% health. This is because insurance company typically do not cover for pre-existing condition for new application. The Basic Eldershield is another coverage you could get for your mum, it provides monthly payout of $300/400 for severe disability for upto 5/6years. She should already have this coverage unless she opt out of the program in the past. She can further enhance the coverage with Eldershield Supplement from NTUC, Aviva or Great Eastern to increase the monthly payout and lifetime payout in the event of severe disability. The government allows a limit of $600 per year to be use from medisave for this upgrade.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Upgraded Medishield Life to Integrated Shield Plan with riders that cover co-insurance and deductibles. Eldershield Upgrade to cover for additional costs of living during times of disability that would pay for additional help.And last but not least, a lifetime annuity. This can be in the form of CPF Life or a private annuity plan. It is insurance for her outliving her assets providing an income for life.0 comments0"
4,"STSean Tan, Financial Consultant  at AXA Insurance SingaporeLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Does her current Shield Plan covers her deductibles and Co-Insurance? For her current age, it's good that you have her covered with a basic Shield Plan. Other than that, is she still under Eldershield (not sure if she has opted out before)? If yes, has she upgraded her Eldershield for a lifetime payout instead of the current 5 years of $300/month about should Severe Disability occurs. If you like, I can help you and your mum do a simple review to see what financial gaps or coverage she could bridge.0 comments0"
