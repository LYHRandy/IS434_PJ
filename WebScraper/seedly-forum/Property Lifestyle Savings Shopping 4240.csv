question,"Property Lifestyle Savings Shopping Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Aug 2019Do people usually bring fixtures to their new house when moving? Is it worth it to incur the cost of dismantling?When moving from one house to another, it is easy to bring over loose pieces of furniture. But I'm wondering if people bring over things like ceiling fan, air conditioner, built-in ovens, stove, sinks and taps? I know this is a weird question but I am just curious as to what people usually do? I just moved into my first home but I find that it would be really expensive to move house if I have to buy all these items all over again, plus the cost of dismantling.1 answerAnswerBump0"

WizardUpdated on 27 Aug 2019HI.Congratulations on moving to the new house! :) So good! :D Your questions: ""I am wondering if people bring over things like ceiling fan, ?? air conditioner, built-in ovens, stove, sink and taps?""Answer:  No. Hardly anyone does because it was build in and dismantling them besides involving cost, your new house also needs to be designed with the same dimension again for build-in ovens, Aircond compressor sizing, sinks and taps.
It is not advisable to do so as these appliance doesn't last (eg. ceiling fan typically about 10 years but after some years the inside capacitor would degrade over wear and tear and slow down in about 7 years, unless u can replace them. Air cond is about 8 to 15 years but newer aircon is with Inverter and better technology which helps saves the most electricity than the older model, you don't want to save 2 to 3k for more / higher electricity bills).
Same for sink and tap, they would rust over a period of use. Furthermore, dismantling them involve cost, cost of moving over, installing at new places etc.
If those things that you plan to move over happens to fail at the new place in about a few months time or even just 1 year, it would not even justify the cost for doing so.
On the other hand, for a new home, you can choose to do only a few things such as paint, aircon (because once furniture in, it is very hard to install later), sink and tap. Ceiling fan and other furniture and fixtures can be installed later when you save the $. The bigger items you can consider credit card instalment scheme as long as you can commit to paying them in time and no delay, it is still manageable. Step by step. It will be ok.
Happy house moving !:)New house new furniture, start afresh! :)0 comments0"
