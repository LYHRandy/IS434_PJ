1,"Cherie Julianne Tan, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered 4w agoHey Xuan!! It is pretty similar to YouTrip actually. The DBS website is pretty comprehensive when it comes to explaining the mechanics of MCA. Maybe you can elaborate more on what you wish to know!
But I'll list down some pros and cons that I face when using the MCA. :)Pros:Able to transfer your money out if you didn't finish using themGet FX alerts for your ideal ratesNo additional card (just the usual Visa Debit card that most of us alr have, the black card)Easier to see when all your accounts are consolidated in one iBanking page No max balance, YouTrip max balance is S$3,000 (doesn't affect me much tho)Cons:YouTrip has better FX rates - this is enough to stop me from using my MCA1 comment4"
