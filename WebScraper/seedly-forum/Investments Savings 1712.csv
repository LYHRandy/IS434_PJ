1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Apr 2019Hello! This is a good question as im sure that many people here are probably wondering the same thing!Here is my personal take on this!Here is a brief overview of the difference between SSB and ETF taken from one of the seedly blog post. I personally would prefer to invest in ETF as comapred to SSB since the returns are likely to be higher as seen from the table above. Also, since you are still young, you can still afford to take risks. Therefore, even though the risk of ETF is likely to be higher, you should still take this risk since you are still young. As seen from the table, if you are looking at investing it would be better to invest in ETF since SSB is used to achieve savings goals rather than investing goals.Hope this helps!0 comments1"

I would personally suggest ETF if you want to experience the feel of ""investing"" where you will see price fluctuation as opposed to SSB where it's rather fixed in terms of price. As what Nicholas mentioned, there are many useful articles Seedly has did up, so do take a read at them0 comments1"

If you want to start, I would recommend start by learning the basic from personal finance blog like seedly and so on.
