1,"Choon Yuan ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Jul 2018If you are public servant working in the govt sector, you are eligible for the Public Officer Group Insurance Scheme. It is a similar Term insurance to MHA/AVIVA.‚ÄãLink: https://income.com.sg/insurance/life-insurance/term-life-insurance/pogis‚ÄãIf you are a female but working in the private sector, I do not think there are any group insurance avaliable for you, other than your company. I will advise purchasing a term insurance from insurance companies. NTUC income has an afforable term policy for female. It is better off than buying whole life recommneded by insurance agents normally.‚Äã0 comments1"

Seedly did a comparison of the direct purchase term insurance here: https://blog.seedly.sg/singaporean-comparison-term-life-insurance/‚ÄãOr if you want to tap on the benefits, find a husband haha (just for laughs, don't kill me)1 comment1"

5,"Jonathan Chia GuangrongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Jul 2018There are other group term insurance schemes available. For eg, if you are an ntuc member, you are eligible for a small sum assured with ntuc income. Off hand I can't think of others but do think there are some other complementary ones.                                                    Or alternatively, if you are already dating a guy who's been through ns via SAF or home team, you can tap on as a spouse into the scheme after marriage (provided he's already into it). Your future kids will also be eligible 0 comments0"

8,"Kenneth Lou29 Jul 2018DeleteEditYo bro, not cool man :( please provide your value and solutions upfront. Usually the most successful financial people here are the ones who actually are willing to craft out a thought out response to help the person asking. And if there is really so much value there, then he/she will choose to contact you. We‚Äôve seen that happen again and again and it is the right way to ‚Äúadvise‚Äù on financial planning :) thanks man."
