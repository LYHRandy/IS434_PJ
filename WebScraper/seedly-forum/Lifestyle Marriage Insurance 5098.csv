1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Term insurance till retirement with a whole life/eci plan, as you'll need that spare cash to mitigate the fact that you two only have each other, and in adulthood/old age you'll only have yourself to depend on. ​Get a trustworthy adviser who can be with you throughout the many years because claiming is hard between just two people.​Retirement planning should be high on your priority list, with a combination of annuities and steady dividends from investments. ​As Tat Tian said, speak to a good FA - and I'd love to help you on this. You can always PM me if you feel comfortable. ​https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Jul 2018The only likelihood for planning required is​1) Retirement planning past 90 age (probable and getting likely)2) Critical Illness treatment which may eat into your retirement cost (hence to insure for that thru ECI/CI).3) Temporary Term coverage for dependents (parents)4) Integrated Shield Plan Premiums (about $2,400 - $5,000 and goes higher the older you become), for hospitalisation.​It also hovers on your budget... so good to speak to an FA or do your own needs planning0 comments0"
