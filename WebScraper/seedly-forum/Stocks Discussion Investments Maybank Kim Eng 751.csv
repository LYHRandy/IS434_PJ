question,"Stocks Discussion Investments Maybank Kim Eng Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Jul 2019What are the charges for selling Maybank Kim Eng odd lots?If I sell off my odd lots now, 'normal' online brokerage commission rates will be charged. The rates stated on the website is 0.12% of contract value and must be a minimum $10 for prefunded account.I have a few queries on this:1) Is the contract value the same as the market price of the shares upon selling?2) If the 0.12% of the contract value is lesser than $10 I will still be charged $10 right?3) I will be charged separately for selling off odd lots from different counters right?2 answersAnswerBump1"

But since Maybank KE has closed MIP, they have a promotion till the end of the year where the commission is the $10 + GST, which usually costs about $10.75, and yes the minimum is $10 so you will be charged $10+ no matter the contract value, you have to call your representative to make the sale for odd lots. The contract value for odd lots would not be same as the market as odd lot market value is slightly lower for every stock. Yes you will be charged separately for different counters, hope this helps.0 comments0"

Contract value = value of your transaction. 2. Minimum is still 10 bucks ++. 3. Separate charges for each transaction. Even if you buy and sell from the same counter, it's considered to be 2 transactions.0 comments0"
