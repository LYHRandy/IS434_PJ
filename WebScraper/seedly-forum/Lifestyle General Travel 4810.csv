1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 12 Jun 2019Hi there anon! I’m sure many are wondering what are the differences between the 2 options and whether they should make a switch too. I did a little research into them with the end goal of convenience. Here are my thoughts:TL;DR SimplyGo is a more convenient option because:It’s more concise to have the payment (and therefore, billing) all done under the same cardYou get to check your travel history and expenditure on the go, making it easy to do expense trackingThe application procedure is less cumbersomeA brief introduction into the 2 services first.SimplyGo allows contactless payments for your public transport rides using your credit/debit card. There won’t be a need for upfront top-ups already, as the bill will be directly charged to your credit/debit card’s bill. Mastercard and Visa contactless bank cards, foreign-issued cards included (although some charges may apply), with an EMVCo Contactless Indicator are accepted.Apart from linking contactless bank cards to your SimplyGo account, commuters can also link their stored value cards (i.e. concession cards, EZ-link cards, NETS Flashpay cards). Other features of SimplyGo include: viewing of your travel expenditure and history on the go, submitting travel claims and viewing its status, paying for penalty fees.EZ-Reload automatically tops up your EZ-Link card balance when it is insufficient. Your EZ-Link card will be linked to your Visa/MasterCard/American Express/Diners Club credit, debit, or charge card account OR to your DBS/POSB bank accounts (Savings or Current) via GIRO.EZ-Reload is only available for EZ-link cards, concession cards have a separate auto top-up system under TransitLink. EZ-Reload is a free service for Visa and Mastercard cardholders, however, a $0.25 fee is charged for each EZ-Reload top-up for Amex & Diners cardholders. The auto top-up can only be triggered once a day for EZ-Reload via GIRO.Now I'll be comparing the application process for both SimplyGo and EZ-Reload.Based on what I've analysed above, my personal choice would be SimplyGo.I like the ease of settling everything under the same card and viewing my travel history & expenditure in a shot. This makes expense tracking (using the Seedly App) a lot more concise! Additionally, as I've mentioned above that convenience was my goal, the application process for SimplyGo is a lot less of a hassle in comparison to EZ-Reload’s. However, I must be objective and point out that EZ-Reload does offer more payment options in comparison to SimplyGo. Ultimately, it depends on a) What payment option you would like to opt for and b) What other features would you expect from the auto top-up system of your choice.Also, ask yourself if you don’t mind taking time out to deactivate your EZ-Reload in order to switch over to SimplyGo. Deactivating your EZ-Reload has to be done at TransitLink Ticket Offices with your NRIC/Passport and your EZ-Link card present.I hope I was helpful on this! Happy traveling :-)5 comments8"

4,"Ronald SzieLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Jun 2019I think just go take advantage of the promotions now then see which method you are used to tap or which has the best promos. I have used SimplyGo since beta and the convenience is really unparalleled. (you can pay with mobile phones or wearables, so no card required). A great time to be a commuter now!0 comments1"
5,ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 10 Jun 2019You could just pay using Android Pay/Google Pay by linking your Visa/MasterCard to your phone. saves lots of trouble having to fish out your cards when you're probably holding onto your phone the majority of the time:)1 comment1

7,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 06 Jun 2019It's easier and helps consolidate bills to one credit card only with simplyGo. On the other hand, as it is still new, it might be able to consider as part of eligible transaction for cashback, which I haven't seen any bank put them in exclusion clause yet. I'm gonna try on that. So strike it hot while it last.0 comments1"
8,"Siow NanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Jun 2019Simplygo is easier now due to current promotions with cards that gives you free or subsidised rides? Also you won't have $50 charges to your credit cards monthly which ez reload charges to maintain the link to your credit cards. (they are not really charged, but irritating to see the pending charge monthly there and receiving msgs on the charge)0 comments1"
