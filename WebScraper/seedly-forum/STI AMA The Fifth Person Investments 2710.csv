Hence, the expected rate should be between 2.98% and 7.39%. Do note that the figure is excluding dividend. 0 comments0"
4,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Not very high annually compared to counterparts like Malaysia and Hong Kong. If you're keen in investing in SGX (without exposure to currency risk), try looking for low-med cap stocks as those have the highest growth potential here.0 comments0"
