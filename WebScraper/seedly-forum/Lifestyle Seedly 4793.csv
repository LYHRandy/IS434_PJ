Another thing is Youtrip does have some issues reflecting the actual transactions made on their app even; so I'm not so sure about the accuracy of these data when ported over to seedly app even if the seedly team manage to make it happen.1 comment1"

Yup now we don't have a feature that allows you to link your youtrip card on Seedly.
We'll let you know if there are plans like that in the future. Thanks! :)
