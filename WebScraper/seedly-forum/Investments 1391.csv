WizardAnswered on 08 May 2019The dividend credited into your account is the AFTER TAX amount.There is no need to manually check or calculate tax returns for it.All US listed companies will have the 30% withholding tax applied on dividends. You would have to fill up the W8Ben form to declare yourself as a foreign alien investor.0 comments2"
