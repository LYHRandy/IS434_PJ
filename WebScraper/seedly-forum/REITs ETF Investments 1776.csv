question,"REITs ETF Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Apr 2019What should I invest in if I'm interested in increasing my passive income? Should I look at investing into REITs, or REIT ETF as such as Lion-Phillip SREIT ETF? My current portfolio consists of SSBs, and monthly RSPs into Nikko STI ETF and Stashaway. The goal is to build a long-term portfolio that will help me to generate passive income in the long run. Was considering making small investments into Lion-Phillip SREIT ETF, to monitor the market and learn more, before eventually buying into the REITs itself, and then diversifying globally. Is this a sound strategy?1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019If you really believe in a long term portfolio you wouldn't be trying to increase your passive income in the short term. You want to set a goal and invest aggressively till that goal is hit, before switching to a dividend paying instrument. Ideally, you want the transitions and choices to be fluid and free, which I can help with.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
