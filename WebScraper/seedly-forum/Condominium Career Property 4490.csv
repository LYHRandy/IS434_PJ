1,"Kai XinLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Advice is don't use too much CPF for your currrent BTO. Use cash as much as possible, take it as forced savings for your new condo. At the end of 5 years, you will pay less accured interest and the lump sum comes back to you as cash to be deployed for your new condo2 comments2"

4,"Nicholas Woon, Marketing Director at ERA Realty Network Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019On average, BTO owners get to pocket $100-150K in cash proceeds after the sale. This helps in the 25% downpayment for the purchase of the condo. If the household income is about $8k monthly and above, you would be able to upgrade quite comfortably. Assuming 35 years old and $4k income per person (5 years later), you and your spouse can loan up to $1 mil (no other outstanding loans) with the current 75% LTV. Hope this clarifies! 2 comments1"
