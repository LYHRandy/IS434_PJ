1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Firstly, congrats that you got the $30k to invest :) it is not easy to save that amount at that age, so kudos to you!!​I would be looking at structuring my portfolio in the following way:​$5k: Rainy day fund (store this in a high interest rate savings account eg DBS Multiplier (around 1.8% p.a) or CIMB fastsaver (around 1% p.a)​$5k: Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) which allows you up to 2+% p.a if you store it there for 10 years. There is a chart for this, just google SSB Singapore! And the best part is that this is semi liquid, which means you can also withdraw it earlier at around 1, 2 or 3 years but the interest rate will be closer towards 1%. This is low risk but also low return.​$10k: REITS - Real Estate Investment Trust which allows you exposure into the property market dependent on sector and the best part is that they will be regulated to distribute over 90% of their net profit. (I personally have bought into the Retail (malls) and Healthcare REITS). Looking to go into industrial soon! This gets me around 5 - 6% p.a. This is mild risk, mild return.​$10k: STI ETF - Basically the Singapore Straits Times Index Exchange Traded Fund. It was designed for passive investors who are just getting started. In fact, most Singapore financial bloggers and our community actually advocates the STI ETF as one of the first products you should consider for this very reason – diversity at low cost. Here is how to get it: Steps here.The STI basically tracks the top 30 companies in the Singapore market which are tradedThese include DBS, OCBC, Singtel, Capitaland etc. (from a mix of industry verticals, you can find the full list below)Please leave your questions in the comments section below! I will try to answer them to the best of my abilities :)​If you need more advice and help, you can find out more here to understand all of your potential investment choices: https://blog.seedly.sg/investment-product-short-medium-long-term/3 comments2"
2,"See all 3 comments Luke Ho25 May 2018Crap I wanted to make a paragraph, not enter it. Ugh. Well. General idea. I would never tout REITs as medium risk medium return. Sure, its not good to generalize all REITs as high risk either, but its certainly generally as risky as aggressive funds (as categorized by MAS with the possibility of a 20% or greater drop over a year). Kenneth Lou25 May 2018LOL haha got it... and yeah i guess so :) The capital losses are indeed very real. Again, do your own due dillegence and definitely think of using the dividends.sg site to also check out historical price movements before hand."
3,"Ray LightLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi all,This is a follow up on my previous question “What investment product should a 23 years old with 30k to invest be looking at?” as a reply to Luke’s comment.​Below is more details about me.1) I’m Self employed2) I do have life insurance, health insurance and an endowment plan 3) In reply to Luke, my passion is in travelling which I do set aside money to fund my hobbies and travel. So the 30k are just money that I hope to grow more passive income with.4) No huge commitments and long term goal at the moment. ​Below are the investments I’m currently holding1) 10k in P2P2) 10k in robo-advisor3) About 5k in Crypto4) 10k in fixed deposit (This is for my UOB one card, as I don’t have a monthly, I was asked too put down a 10k in FD to get the card)Not counting in my travel fund, emergency fund and daily expenses. I have about another 30k in savings that I hope to invest. So I was wondering if there’s any products that I can consider.​So from Kenneth reply, Would this be my best course of action?1) 5k in SSB2) 10k in REITS3) 10k in STI ETF (Is this similar to robo?)​Sorry for the extreme long message and thanks for all the help!1 comment1"

If your income is unstable, you might want to hold a bit more cash in fixed deposit or high interest savings account. This will serve as a form of emergency fund should you need money immediately. You may want to take the duration to withdraw funds vs the returns you might get into consideration in the allocation of your 30k.

6,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Anonymous,​I apologize for being curt but this kind of question is super annoying. Of course its more practical than asking this under your own name and having a bajillion pms or comments headed towards you, but I assume you want structured help and therefore your question needs an equal structure. ​Firstly, congrats on your first world problem. I assume you worked part time, saved a lot during NS or your first years of work or whatever. That kind of dilligence is commendable. Theres lot of potential there for growth. ​The problem is with what and for what reason. ​Kenneth has given a general suggestion and to be fair to him, its a very good one. If you have no crap clue what you're doing with your life, Id take his advice. ​But personally, I saved a lot after NS too and I dont like the idea of saving for saving. In fact, no matter how balanced the portfolio, even if it grows at 9% a year unfailingly, Id still be unhappy. And its because you're a 23 year old who hasnt figured out what the money is for. ​As an FA, my job is to tie your life goals with financial goals. Some people claim to be conservative investors. But when you show them that theres no way they can reach their long term goal in time (house car etc) unless they invest more aggressively, they become more balanced investors. Your desires should define what you want to do with that money - in the short, medium and long term. I say desires because if you had serious pressing unhealthy desires you would have spent a lot more of that money. So the best advice I can give you to complement Kenneth is to just advice you to think about what you want in life, what SPENDING THAT MONEY ON would give you the MOST FULFILLMENT.​Do you want a big wedding? A big car? A big house? Do you want to give more money to your parents? Do you want passive income? If yes to something, how much? By when? Does putting aside this 30k leave you with constant regeneration of savings, or was it acquired by luck and you shouldnt use all of it? Write down specific things you want by each age and then you can realize how hard you need to work plus how the 30k would be best used. ​FFF2 comments1"
