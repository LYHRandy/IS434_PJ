question,Savings Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Jan 2019(a) What are the chances that I will lose my principle for my Insurance savings plan that does not guarantee the principle? (b) Should I withdraw the guaranteed interest?I bought a 25 year plan- Revosave by NTUC income 9 years ago. I found that the principle sum that I am paying per year is not guaranteed :'( . There is only a guaranteed interest of $1000/year (from the 2nd year onwards = $24K at the end of 25 years) which I can withdraw before maturity. I can withdraw $8000 now. I am putting ~$1500 into the fund yearly. I am worried about losing my principle. (a) What are the chances that I will lose my principle?

1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Any bonuses declared to your policy over the last 9 years are guaranteed. The interest earned is also earning a compunded of (up to) 3.25% when left inside the policy. So if you do not require the cashflow, leave it inside the policy. It's already guaranteed. Your main concern would only come on the year of maturity. Most flexible endowment plans have significantly high Terminal Bonus (the amount paid in the last year just before it matures), in fact most of your yield would come from said TB.When insurers cut bonuses for the year, usually on TB is affected. So if you suay and NTUC decides to cut bonuses on the final year of your policy, then you may not receive the bonuses of the last year as stated in the BI. But again, every bonus posted since, is guaranteed once declared.3 comments2"

And I know it's convenient to ask online, but not everyone on this platform are experts. Best is still to call the insurer directly with queries. Question Poster22 Jan 2019Indeed not everyone are experts but thankful for good advice obtained! I wrote into the insurance company to ask for clarification but they did not get back to me. Called hotline and they couldn't answer me as well. After your advice, I checked my yearly payout letter and they did declare the % guaranteed there so alls good :)"
3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do you have the benefit illustration? That would make it easy to compute. Though as i am a professional, i do charge fees for doing up the complete report for thinking of surrendering or not.For general enquiries, what i can share with you is this.1) Any guaranteed amount in the benefit illustration is guaranteed.2) Any non-guaranteed component is guaranteed, once the yearly bonus is declared by income.The surrender value currently consist of both sections. Do contact me further if you really want an answer for an unbias opnion on loss-minimising or best yield for surrendering (and it may not be at maturity too). https://www.facebook.com/Singapore-Insurance-Value-Finding-993196427536303/1 comment0"
