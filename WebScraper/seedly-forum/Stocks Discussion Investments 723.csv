1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Aug 2019Quite a bit of premium on the stock price at the moment. Did some dca into it and sold off the odd lots early this year to reinvest into something else. Kicked myself over the timing but nothing I can do about it now.I'd say there's still room to grow for the reit portfolio wise. Still a number of properties under sponsor's portfolio that are spread around the area. But I'll want to wait for the spread between price and nav to be much much narrower before I consider any taking up a new position. At current yield, its a no go for me. I'll consider the NAC reit for a better yield under the mapletree umbrella.0 comments1"
