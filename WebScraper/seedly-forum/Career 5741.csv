1,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 08 May 2019I've tried to start a digital marketing agency while I'm a student. The idea came from watching digital marketing tutorials on YouTube. I'd suggest by starting a cash flow business.This could include things that doesn't require a huge capital. They are usually service based business that trades your hours for dollars.Some of these services include:
1. Graphic design
2. Web design
3. Digital marketing
4. Video editing
5. CopywritingThese are skills that you can charge companies and entrepreneurs a good amount of money in exchange for your time. Once you've that steady stream of income coming in, you've the capacity to pay your mortgage, bills, marriage, etc, etc.From there, you can start a more scalable business that is more product based. Things like a retail shop selling products or a Software as a Service company.That's because in order for you to scale all these businesses, you need money. Money to be spent on marketing, to acquire customers, to build your product.If you jump straight into a product based business right away, you're already at a negative cahs flow. You don't want to be put in that position where you struggle to pay bills.All the best for your entrepreneurial journey.Cheers.0 comments1"
