God of WisdomUpdated on 06 Sep 2019This is the problem when people repeat blindly without knowing what they're talking about.You bought a CPFIS ILP. It has no insurance charges. When you bought it 2 years ago, you were charged a 3% sales charge and a 1% advisory fee per year. Now this advisory fee has dropped to 0.7%. Next year 0.4%.What's more important than the ILP, is the choice of funds you've invested in.How about you just check how much that 60k is worth right now?Also, are you planning to use that 60k to pay for the house? If yes, you're gonna need to sell anyway. If no, do you still want to invest your CPF monies? If yes, and the performance and allocation of the funds are sound, you can keep it. If you want to invest, but want to choose different funds, just do a fund switch, it's free. If you don't want to invest and just get a guaranteed 2.5% interest, you can choose to surrender the policy.4 comments3"
2,"See all 4 comments T@Takingstock @06 Sep 2019But if you had invested 60k, and now its worth only 58k... The investment has barely moved to recover the sales charges n fees.

If you left the 60k to earn cpf interest, you would have 1.5k interest per year.

I am kinda confused how can the returns be ""not so bad""Question Poster06 Sep 2019I only know it is called the global balanced fund.. @talkingstock because I know it is investment that is y I still think its ok atmðŸ˜…."

5,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 05 Sep 2019It will depend on when you bought the ILP. If it is within the first 14 days free-look grace period, the premium would be returned to your CPF untouched. However, if you choose to cancel it outside of the free-look period, ILPs typically have a very poor surrender value and you will get a significantly lesser amount than that you put it. I would suggest that you contact the FA who sold you the product- he/she would be able to advise you on the surrender value of said Manulife ILPs.1 comment0"
