1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Apr 2019Dbs vickers may not be the best choice due to the commission structure of minimum 25 usd per trade. Interactive brokers and Td Ameritrade will charge lower. I'm getting a 5 USD minimum with Td due to a group rate via my community and there are no custodian or live data fees involved0 comments0"
