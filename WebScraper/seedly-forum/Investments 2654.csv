1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Feb 2019There could be a few reasons why... High growth companies that need more cashflow to fund their expansionFirms that believe that the value of their shares will increase if the firms can redirect the dividends paid out for company growth instead (which will increase share price)There could also be high potential expense of issuing new stock. To avoid such a risk of raising money this way, they choose to keep their earnings instead of issuing dividendsTax. But this varies from country to country. 0 comments1"
2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Feb 2019There could be a few reasons why companies choose not to pay dividends. It could be that the money is needed to fund expansion/other business needs, or that it is not common practice in the particular industry for companies to distribute dividends, etc.Some people choose to invest in this kind of companies because they believe that these companies will be able to reinvest the money into their expansion well. In this case, investors will be able to make capital gains rather than gains from dividends.0 comments0"
3,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 25 Feb 2019This varies based on a company's individual choice- in this case FB, but I believe there are certain similarities across the board.Firstly it depends on the industry and their practices. FB is a tech growth giant. Most other tech growth stocks and FAANG stocks(with exception of Apple and Microsoft) do not offer dividend payouts. For maximum growth, Investors rather see all earnings reinvested into furthering company growth in revenues. Dividends are usually a way to reward shareholders and improve attractiveness of being a stakeholder, which tech growth stocks have no need to sell- given their potential upside in capital gains. In fact, most companies like FB practice share-buybacks instead, especially when they believe their shares to be trading at undervalued levels.For big conglomerates with large relatively stable revenues and earnings stream- often falling under the term ""Value Stocks"" such as Coca-cola or industries like REITs and Banks, dividends are a norm to incentivise long term sharekeeping.0 comments0"
