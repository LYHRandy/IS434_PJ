Grand MasterAnswered on 28 Aug 2019Be honest.You can start off by asking if you can reply by Thursday, say, at 3 pm.They probably won't bother asking why if they are readily agreeable.By then you have finished your interview on Thursday and can guess whether you will like or be accepted by this alternate employer.0 comments3"

Was looking for the answer to this a while back as well and I chanced upon this telegram channel (https://t.me/werkwerksg) which had some good tips! For e.g. https://t.me/werkwerksg/10 has the relevant answers to the above question. Would say it offered me a few different perspectives. Can check out the above page and follow too~

3,"Jerry TayLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 Sep 2019There is no easy answer to this. One way is to ask if you could extend till Thursday for your answer.The fact that you are considering another job interview shows that you are not as keen on the current one you got cause if you were, you would have already accepted it. You need to think hard whether you really want the job that is offered. If you feel the current job offered is not the best suit, do not feel obliged to accept. Ultimately, you can't have both options and you have to choose to accept or reject the offer for better opportunities.0 comments0"

Also, look around at glassdoor reviews of current employees working in the same country as a gauge of which company would be the best fit for you.0 comments0"
