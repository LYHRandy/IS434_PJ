2,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Are you an official licensed debt collector?​When you loaned out your money, was there document proof? Meaning the debtor signed, with IC number and identification? ​If you have a legal document proof you can try a lawyer.​https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/debt-recovery-singapore/ 2 comments0"
3,"Bear Cranky18 Jun 2018Hi Gabriel, I not debt collector. Im juz a kind soul who lent ex-colleague $4k & put $20k in her dad Time Deposit to get extra Snr Citizen interest from 1992. She cheated all these money & nv pay me any TD Interest! So I hire Debt Collector to chase her. Debt Collector lied tt can find out her Co & dad hme addr bt nw say cant find! Fail to recover any money! I DID let her sign IOU bt lawyer say must chase back within 6 yrs :(Gabriel Tham18 Jun 2018oh dear...sad to hear this happened to you. Yea, since 1992 till now it is abit hard to chase back even for legal debt collectors. Because from 1992 to 2018, a person can change multiple addresses, even migrate to other countries, change phone number etc. Worst case they can even change citizenship....

I think at most you can try file a police report, but even then the police will also have hard time to trace the person."
