1,"Chuin Ting WeberLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 May 2019Hi Anonymous, the funds MoneyOwl currently uses in our portfoios are not Shariah-compliant. This is an area in which we would need time to do some research on the options available for globally diversified, low-cost, market-based funds that are Shariah-compliant and yet have a long enough track record such that we can be confident of  how such a composition delivers and if it can fulfil the required return. In the same vein, we are also in the midst of tying up with estate planners on will-writing for Muslims -- as you might know, we are a comprehensive financial adviser. Apart from investments, if you are Singaporean we would also soon be rolling out CPF planning (CPF LIFE is compulsory now) and once that's launched, we would be able to help all our clients plan for retirement with that as a base.Thank you!0 comments7"
2,"Sin Ting So, Head Of Client Experience at EndowusLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 May 2019Hello! We do not offer Shariah-compliant funds in our portfolios yet, but this is definitely something we are looking at. We are independent and agnostic to investment product providers, and want to select the best and most suitable products for our clients. We are constantly evaluating fund managers and funds, and will let you know when Shariah-compliant portfolios are available.0 comments5"
