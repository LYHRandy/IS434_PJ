question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Jul 2019My insurance agent (who was my friend) quit. What should I do?My friend who was an insurance agent made me buy some policy from him. I did so out of friendship. Now, he has announced that he is shifting to another industry and is handing over my portfolio to someone else that I don't know of. Now, I don't really trust this friend anymore. Feel a bit cheated, like MLM peer pressure. Should i just cancel this savings plan? I have other plans with other agents at the moment.3 answersAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterAnswered on 26 Jul 2019I am sorry to see that you felt that way when purchasing the plan. Do not surrender the plan for the sake of doing it. You may want to speak to your friend or the new advisor
taking over and understand the impact of surrendering your plan.More often than not, if your plan is less than 2 years, you will lose everything you have put in. And these loss, are unnecessary if you can sustain the plan, etc. You can treat your endowment plan as part of your bond portfolio too.
Speak to your friend or new advisor to understand the pros and cons better!0 comments6"

ProdigyAnswered on 26 Jul 2019Just like to ask prior to buying from your friend, have you known or been in contact with other friends or agents? There are good ones out there you just need to find someone you can trust to seek advice. Do you surrender the savings plan? It depends. Be educated on the pros and cons before making the decision!0 comments0"

What are your insurance products about?Do go and understand if you have no clue.Insurance agents have no obligations to service you. Their sole purpose is to sell consumers insurance products and pocket the commissions.Also, do not ever mix insurance with investment as these products are very expensive and comes with mediocre coverage and neligible returns.Do your own due diligence as it is your hard earned money.Cheers!0 comments0"
