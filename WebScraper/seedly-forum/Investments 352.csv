1,"Carol ChiaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 25 Jun 2019Wien's 2-day workshop is well-worth the money spent.  I am very appreciative of the fact that he took time and effort to ensure that our notes, examples and case studies are up-to-date.  This is important for newbies like us to relate to the current situations and see for ourselves the live markets in motion.  I once attended a 1-day investment workshop and the examples quoted in the notes were before 2010.The class is also very interactive and he willingly imparts and shares his knowledge.  You can really feel his  enthusiasm and excitement when the class understands him and agrees with what he is teaching. Unlike the other workshop I attended where the instructor was like a machine reading out from the notes.After the class I was confident to attempt to build my own portfolio.  When in doubt, Wien can be consulted via his personal mobile or email.  This really helps alot as I embark on my investment journey.  Also, we were given a free 30-day trial of the Reitscreener which is a real bonus !!!  I'll definitely sign up the basic plan for a start.Conclusion - highly recommended for anyone at any stage of your investment journey.0 comments1"
2,"Ryan Weng Yew NgeiLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 24 Jun 2019Wien's REITs course is GREAT. He explained REITs from the foundation to advance evaluation. His case studies are real life REITs. The part I really like MOST is how to evaluate REIT to determine its Fair Value.After the course, I  initially monitoring the Shortlisted REITs. Later, I ""test water"" by investing a little. I made a small profit. At this point, I am convinced that Wien's method works. I invested more in REITs and made back more than the course fees.More importantly, this course teaches me ""How to fish which will feed me for life, rather than just feeding us with fishes (tips) which will only feed me for the short term"".Regards,

I have actually written a comprehensive review on the REITs to Riches workshop by Pro Butterfly.

4,"Cynthia Tay25 Jun 2019I attended his course at the beginning of this year. He is a super savy investor and things he mentioned during the course abt certain counters really actualised few mths down the road. Wein is a relatively safe investor, hence his approach works for me. :)"
5,"Tan Siak LimLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 Nov 2018I highly recommend Wien's REITs to Riches course to investors who like investing in REITs for dividends. Wien will show you that REITs is more than just in investing for dividends, and the traditional selection criteria using low P/B and high yield may actually get you into trouble! Wien is extremely passionate about sharing his knowledge and encouraged all participates to interact with him via whatsapp with his personal number, where I got the most value! His course is concise and everything is presented clearly and without the fluff that is typical with other investment courses, playing stupid games that waste time.0 comments1"
6,"Dean GohLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 30 Nov 2018Highyl recommended! ProButterfly's (aka Wien) classes are organised and structured. He provides you a very good understanding in the basics of REITs, which is crucial if you were to understand REITs in a more macro and complex perspective in the future. Wien is also very patient in answering your questions, and provides very thorough and well thought through replies. Highly knowledgeable in REITs and someone who geniunely wants to pass his knowledge forward, I recommend attending Wien's classes. 0 comments1"
7,"Bernard SiowLevel 1. FreshieAnswered 2w agoPersonally, I have been investing in Singapore REITs for a couple of years. Every quarter, I would spend my time diligently looking at the results presentation, the press release and news at SGX. Bought a number of REITs, some are performing well and some are not performing well. I avoided quite a number of bad reits or stocks but still manage to step on some bad ones or rather from okay at first it turned sour later on. I believed time will definitely tell if it is bad or good but till that time damage could have already been done. And the accumulated dividends you collected may or may not cover the fall of the REIT price that you have invested. I have always been interested in REITs as it provided me with dividend, some REITs give you both dividend plus capital gain from the increased share price.Okay. I attended the 3-hour preview first. In the preview, it was mentioned that on top of Singapore REITs, we will also learn about the international REITs which I was interested in. Plus the course is registered under skills future and I have not used my skills future credit. Well, I thought to myself, it might be time to finally use my skills future credit on something interesting and useful. So I signed up for the 2 days wkend course to find out more.
In the 2 day course, we learnt how to evaluate the REITs via its past, present and future, learn what to look out for in the traits of good REITs and the myths or misconceptions outside which you may have read or believed till now that it was proven not right. The up-to-date case studies are familiar to me as I was following the Singapore REITs closely and able to related to them, especially those bad ones I have invested in. Yes, we went through some of the international REITs in hong kong and US. And some of the stuff which I read in the results presentation slides but never really know how to apply or never thought about applying, now I know how to read and use them after the course.I have attended other REIT course  (a cheaper and 1-day course which cover most of the stuff I already know, regret attending it - maybe only good for newbies) which did not cover the topics of REITs so in-depth and in so much details (comprehensive) and with so many case studies. Didn't know REIT course can go so in-depth. maybe I have underestimated it. I didn't regret spending my skills future credit on the course and think the skills future credit was put into good use.
In the investment journey where you learn it by yourself, you probably will still step on some bad ones. You just can't look at the sponsor only or think the sector expected to grow and has potential, high yield, low book value, investing is not so straight forward as what you may have thought.
If you like to learn more about REITs (esp. Singapore REITs) and investing in REITs the profitable way, you should be considered attend probutterfly REITs to riches course as it is comprehensive, in-depth and has lots of real case studies (best is to learn through the first-hand experience from a practitioner himself). You may find yourself getting a much better headstart than me (for newbies out there) and become better than most retail REIT investors out there.0 comments0"
