WizardAnswered on 06 Mar 2019I think the rule of thumb that I have read elsewhere is that you should leave your foreign investments unhedged when the local currency is depreciating against the foregin investment currency. When you want to hedge your risk, you can look invest in hedged-overseas assets, such as hedged ETFs, and although there is a fee of the hedging, this should be worth it after all. To hedge risk yourself, you can also look at currency forwards, options and futures, but some of these choices may not even be availible to retail investors. Currency ETFs can also be used where a specific currency is the underlying asset that the ETF is based on.0 comments0"
