question,"General Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Jul 2018Is that any way to gain miles point from unavoidable fund transfer?For example, renting house transfer to landlord every month? Is the service that I pay merchant using credit card, while they will help me to transfer. Maybe have charges like 0.1~0.5%. With that way, at least the $2000 I paid can earn miles point. (Just asking if that kind of services exist ? )2 answersAnswerBump0"

ProdigyAnswered on 21 Jul 2018I am not sure if such service but if your landlord accept grab pay or singtel dash, you can top up such service with credit card and then fund transfer to your landlord. Of course there's limitation such as singtel dash can only top up Max of S$200/month and most credit card don't give you much rebate for topping up third party payment service app (you need to check your credit card tnc) 0 comments0"
