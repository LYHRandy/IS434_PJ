question,"STI ETF ETF Robo-Advisors Fresh Graduates Savings Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Nov 2018I'm a fresh grad, looking to invest 30% of my salary ($1900 after CPF). If I'm considering investing purely into equities (e.g. STI ETF, Robo), what would you recommend my asset allocation to be?I'll have around S$570 to invest each month. Currently already investing S$100/mth in STI ETF. Should I increase that, or what else should I invest in? As a context, I do not have much time / knowledge to analyse, monitor and buy/sell individual stocks, hence was looking more at ETFs.Open to investing in assets other than equities too, please feel free to suggest / advise.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Your asset allocation should follow your age as the % of monies in fixed income.So if you're 25, have a 75 Equity 25 Bonds Split.For your equities allocation, I'll set up to have a global exposure. I wouldn't even touch SG equities.Split them into US, UK, EU, Asia, Japan, Emerging Markets. Your % of choice in each sector is up to you.Also make sure that you're diversified across sectors as well. Not so heavy into tech and financial even though they're very appealing. Get some defensive sectors as well. 2 comments4"
2,"Question Poster16 Nov 2018Thank you! What channels would you recommend for me to go to, to invest in US, UK, EU, Asia, Japan and Emerging Markets? New to investing here. Is this only doable by a broker, or are Robo-advisors able to do that for me?Hariz Arthur Maloy16 Nov 2018Both platforms would have that option. Personally for Robos, I would look at FSM Maps. "
