1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 02 Mar 2019I think you need to think about what you are trying to do. It sounds like you want to cover both objectives of insurance and saving together.SA cant help u for accidents and illness.
By the other side, insurance endowment plans also dont necessarily do well at returns for retirement.Probably better to carve out different budgets for each. Having said that, it is very very difficult to beat cpf sa risk free interest rate consistently year after year.0 comments0"
