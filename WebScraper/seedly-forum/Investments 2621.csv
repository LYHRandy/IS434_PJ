1,Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Jun 2018Hi there! I think what you have now makes sense and is actually a pretty disciplined approach to this.​What I would recommend you to do now is to actually read Jacky's answer here in this question. Let me highlight some parts of it:​His first 2 years of investing:US tech stocks for capital gain (super high risk)balance risk of US tech stocks with p2p lending (medium risk)​His hypothetical 2-5th year of investing (not there yet this is my 1st year only)capital gain from tech stock slowly converted to SG Reits for future dividend portfolio (medium to low risk)​His hypothetical 5th - 10 year of investing slowly build up dividend portfolio and waiting for dividend to compound the returns (medium to low risk)CPF should have some money (low risk)0 comments3
2,"James YeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Jun 2018Hi, in my opinion, i think you want to seek some overseas exposure since u already have 80% in sti index.There are 3 easy ways.
1) DIY dollarcostaveraging - you can still invest overseas using maybank investment plan to nibble bit by bit (min. 100 every stock i think)
2) you can buy the overseas stocks outright through stock brokerages. Most of them cover US. Can opt for ifast for cheaper comm.
3) invest in mutual funds with global exposure (can see from fundsupermart too) Hope it helps. Cheers0 comments1"

4,Melvin HuangLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 27 Feb 2019U don't need to invest in overseas. even local can have good investment tool. looking at etf and ssb it only earns u max 5%. if u have cash u can put at other platform like seedin. they are offering 10% P.A. this is the highest i see at the current market compare to stocks saving bonds etc.0 comments0

RookieAnswered on 29 Jun 2018Hi, in order to save on the transaction costs, you could pile up the allocated amount for your monthly SSB and lump sum invest when you see that there is a favourable interest rate at a particular month that suits your investment horizon. :) 0 comments0"
