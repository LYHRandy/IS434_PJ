3,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Oct 2018Retirement plans that banks are providing is no different from what a Financial Planner like myself can provide. (difference is the after-service, as most retirement plans nowadays come with features such as addditional pay-outs if disability occur. If you purchase it from a bank, you may need to service the policies on your own versus having your own persona Financial Advisor)​For retirement, the important factors are inflation rates, how much you need when you retire. With that, you can work out how much to start saving from today to meet your goals when you retire.​Given your risk profile, you may perhaps consider topping up your SA accounts at  a guaranteed rate of 4%, or park your money into dividend funds that pay approx 5 - 7% yearly, or consider putting some into REITS.​For Manulife RetireReady (offered by DBS since they are one of our distribution channels), it offers the highest guaranteed payout in the market currently, and would provide additional payout should one be unable to perform 2 out of 6 Activities of Daily Living.​Feel free to PM me at https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chen should you like to find out more0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 06 Oct 2018If you can stand the paltry returns given by such products offered by banks and insurers, well, have a look and consider them. But I'll implore you to reconsider. There's high distribution costs involved. And it'll take a lot of money put into such products to achieve your retirement goals. Like you, I started investing in my 30s. I paid to attend various investment and trading workshops and settled on one eventually. This will supercharge my portfolio to achieve the type of returns I want to allow me to quit my day job and manage it full time within a handful of years. If you are not savvy, find a way to build your knowledge and your confidence in stocks and related products and go from there. Find your own red pill and find your rabbit hole.
