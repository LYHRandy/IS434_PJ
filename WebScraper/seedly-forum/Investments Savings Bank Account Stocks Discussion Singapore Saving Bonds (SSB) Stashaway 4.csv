1,"Asheesh Chanda, Founder at Kristal.AILevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 10h agoI would suggest you evaluate a systematic plan into a balanced portfolio - which has a good mix of Equity ETFs, Bond ETFs and Gold. Systematically adding to such a portfolio every month can help build a corpus over time. You can also run the algorithm we have made available at Kristal.AI to see what is the suggested recommendation for your profile. Do note at Kristal.AI we have made investments upto 50K USD totally free of any advisory fee or hidden charges. Do compare it to other Robos before you go ahead.0 comments8"

Can take a look at Echanged traded funds (ETFs) first as a form of passive income with little maintenance.Stashaway and posb/DBS invest saver are ETFs while SSB is a government bond.0 comments1"
