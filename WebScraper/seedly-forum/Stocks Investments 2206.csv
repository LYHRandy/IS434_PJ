1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019Hi!Personally, that's not something that I would recommend because there are alot of issues that may ensue. It's all good if you are making money but what happens when you are losing.. Is the party who is making the purchase decision responsible for the losses? .. or.. How do you ensure that a conflict regarding money doesn't break out among your friends?Ultimately, there has to be some sort of agreement beforehand if you are still keen to do this :)0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 08 Mar 2019I did that and it is still successful after a few years.BUT there is a criteria - Only 1 person makes the decision of buying and selling on a daily basis.It is having a manager on daily operations, but if there is any changes in the activities of the fund, all of us will come together and make a decision.0 comments1"

Money has ways of destroying relations.There are many points to consider. How are the profits, dividends shared?Who owns how many % of the shares? If there is one party leaving the group, how? sell and return money?If company does rights issues, who provide the cash?AGM who is entitled to attend?Each person contribute how much? what if someone didnt contribute suddenly?AND MANY MORE QUESTIONS! Better to just save up and invest yourself. Your group can come together to analyse stocks but putting in money is best to do yourself0 comments1"

For me, max 10k cash.If wanna create partnership, need to be minimum 100k each to be cost efficient. Yearly $75 and filing to acra. Yearly filing to iras cos taxable dividends.

5,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 09 Mar 2019Can, if the one doing is willing to do spreadsheets and show the others how much they make, what’s their share of returns/dividends. If lose money, who wanna be responsible?Like that machiam mini fund manager. (Unpaid). If it were to be this way, then profit you all share, losses you take full, want?While it is advantageous to multiply the returns by pooling, it is also disadvantageous when money is lost. Cough cough “Hyflux” cough cough.Just to add on. Whoever is using their names to buy the stocks better not end up bedridden, comatose, use the stocks as collateral, or end up dying. Cos if they don’t put contract, or the ringleader do not do a proper will, all these guys  hard earn money will go to ringleader’s family!0 comments0"
