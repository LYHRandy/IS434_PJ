1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 02 Jul 2019EC seems to be a better choice for upsides if you can apply for it. It is offered at a lower price than private but after MOP it is worth as much as a condo.
Good locations are definitely in the central area. And needs to be near MRT, 5 mins preferable. Good amenities nearby such as shopping malls, hawker centres.1 comment0"
2,"Josh Ng02 Jul 2019I hear what you are saying but I don't exactly agree. I think location plays an important role and even though discounts are factored in an EC price, it's hard to commute because it would take 30-60 min to get to CBD areas unless you drive (which is a separate conversation as you could argue it's a depreciating liability). Regarding MOP and EC costing the same as a private, EC by virtue sits in the outskirts of SG and I doubt it can fetch the same price as private in city fringe districts."
