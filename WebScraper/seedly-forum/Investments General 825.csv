1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Jul 2019I am using it. I find it very useful in keeping track of my investments. They also provide useful information, such as when dividends are coming up, what your projected dividends for the year is, and the various ratios that you'd need to do some analysis. Would recommend.0 comments0"

I paid for the 1 year subsciption and I feel the functions and such are very helpful, things like watchlist, keeping track of dividends and transactions.If you'd like to try out the paid version, you can use my referral code to try it out for 2 months !!https://stocks.cafe/user/tosignup?referral_code=udhKxDEXM0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 17 Jul 2019There is a free version of stockscafe with limited functions.However, I do feel it is really worth to pay for stockscafe. Compared to other portfolio tracking, this is one of the most comprehensive and cheapest option around. It provides alot of insights and reports, upcoming dividends, benchmarking etcIf your portfolio is small, you can just use the free one or depend on the default CDP holdings.0 comments0"
