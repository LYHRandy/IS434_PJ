It's not about the $1 spending on credit card but rather salary credit is too low. Use the calculator at their website to calculate the interest you can earn: https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/landing/dbs-multiplier/If you credit the full 1.5k in and spend $1 on credit card, you'll get on 0.05% interest. The better choice would be go to CIMB fastsaver hassle free 1% no conditions that earns you more interest. You can still apply the DBS live fresh and use as you wish.Check out also Seedly savings a/c calculator see which is the best choices of savings a/c for you: https://seedly.sg/tools/savings-account-calculator0 comments1"
