God of WisdomAnswered 1d agoIf you apply after the op, she will have to declare her health status as well as the operation. This will likely lead to an exclusion, possibly a decline, but it depends on the underwriter. However, if she has had incomeshield all this while, coverage for that will remain as it is.0 comments0"
