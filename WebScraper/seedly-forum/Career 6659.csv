MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Semi useful ​if you got good credientials then head hunters will contact you but understand that they are paid based on placement of candidates into roles.​some might just be contacting you for your resume. Which is a form of currency in the head hunter market.0 comments1"
2,"Adrian Goh Jun Wei, Product at NodeflairLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 23 Sep 2018It is actually pretty useful (assuming you meant recruiters reaching out)​Worked with recruiters (both HR and external recruiters) a couple of times and personally used LinkedIn Recruiter, so here's my experience to help you stand out in searches and reached out by recruiters more often!​TLDR: Recruiters search by companies and keywords, so do ensure you include them​How to come out in recruiters' search:​1) Make sure you have a conventional title for your job titles. If you are a software engineer, add 'Software Engineer' instead of 'Java Software Engineer'. 'Coding Ninja' won't turn up in recruiters' search (think of it as Google)​2) Include proper keywords in your Skills. If you specialise in Market Research, include it! If you are great at Online Marketing, include it!​How to have your profiles stand out:​1) Have a good profile picture! Having a selfie/ blurry image as your profile picture gives a poor first impression! Also, don't forget to SMILE! :D​2) Be SUCCINCT when describing your experience! You don't want to list a whole paragraph on your role when it can be done in 2-3 point forms. Recruiters are humans too, help them help you!​3) List impactful outcomes of your work! Instead of saying 'Developed a mobile app', say 'Developed a mobile app with 100k downloads and improves user base by 25% in 3 months' (but make sure it is true!)​4) To truly stand out, write a good summary. Give a quick summary of your career, your specialties and passion!​Hope this help! :)​0 comments1"

4,Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Used LinkedIn actively when I was a student and I find it pretty useful in browsing for jobs and it'll also recommend jobs for you based on your profile. It's also easier for recruiters to check out your portfolio0 comments1

Company HR uses it to find suitable candidates easily.  Agent use it to find possibly match of candidates. ​A few tips :(1) do a good profile. Google how to do a good.proifle (2) go add all the agent so to be in their Network and radar. (3) follow the big or Target company you're Keen then when they have job offerings , or company major news. You will be first to know and be more prepared. ​Happy Job hunting ! 0 comments1"
