WizardAnswered on 02 Sep 2018Definitely SBF since the savings of 250k would have been in better use for investment and many other things. ​Down the road, even in a low market, the 150k SBF after sale would have yielded much higher returns than the mature 400k. 0 comments2"
2,"Kai XinLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 28 Oct 2018Maybe you want to share which is the area of SBF and mature location?A lot would also depend on the development of the area, which would contribute to the upside of property value. Digital Hub coming up in Punggol would probably add value to the flats there.Serangoon area has limited upside due to the stability of infrastructures.0 comments0"

4,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Sep 2018I would grab sale of balance flat. Transportation will only get better because more and more people will be in the estate and their transportation needs need to be catered for. Same for facilities etc. which will help improve value of the flat in the long term.The savings you have now can also go into a good renovation or savings/investments. I know of people who gets resale because they want a good location and do not think big renovations are necessary but be aware that there are hidden things you never know until you actually stayed in the place; like bad wiring etc. which can still costs a bomb.​That said, better location often refers to either near MRT or mature estates; both telling me there's not much room for increasing the value of your flat in the long term unless there are great plans... and usually government will have grand plans for new estates, not really mature ones.​Just my 2cents worth.0 comments0"
