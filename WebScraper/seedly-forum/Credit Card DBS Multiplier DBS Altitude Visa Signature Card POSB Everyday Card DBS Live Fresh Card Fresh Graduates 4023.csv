1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Aug 2019Most cashback cards require you have had minimum spending before you can get the cashback.As for the DBS Altitude, if you don't think you can hit that amount, then don't force yourself to. There's no need to take advantage of the promotion; the card benefits are good enough (in my opinion at least).0 comments0"
2,"Huang Yixuan, Product Designer at SomewhereLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 22 Aug 2019Hey! Is this your first card? For me the Live Fresh card is my base card because you get up to $20 cashback on online spend (total $400) and $20 cashback on paywave (total $400), I usually spend using these two methods so most months I can get $40 back. On top of that, for big ticket items like plane tickets or travel accoms I use another miles card to book!2 comments0"
