CIMB offers a decent interest rate for a no-frills bank account so you can leave it there and draw on it as needed.However, although UOB and DBS offer a decent interest, you will be able to achieve better returns when you deploy them into income-producing assets. To that end, I would recommend a watch list of good income-producing stocks/REITs/ETF and slowly deploying your capital over time, with the money in the banks used as a warchest should the market present to you good opportunities.When planning to semi-retire by early 40s, have an idea of the minimum cashflow you'll need for your expenditure, and aim to see how to meet that cashflow with a mixture of guaranteed and non-guaranteed income assets (which you will build from your early 30s to your 40s). You can also consider annuities that guarantee your capital but provide you with a guaranteed income, with the option to surrender and take back your capital should you need it again.0 comments5"
