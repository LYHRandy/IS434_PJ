1,"David MorganLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 13 Jun 2019That’s tough but you have to keep going. What are you currently working as? Do you have any high income skills? Do you have any passion that you could turn into profit? If you are lazy to even explore then I would suggest to just find part time jobs during the weekend? If you have to spend family time at home or have to be home during weekends, maybe you could find home based jobs like freelance Social media marketing or free lance digital work such as video editing for clients and such. I had debt too and i had 5 debts to repay to. My monthly salary then was around $2k and my debts amount to around $10k. What I did was to sacrifice some of my own entertainment and leisure spendings. I unsubscribe to my Netflix, I took public transport instead of renting a car, I cooked my own lunchbox in the morning to eat and I remember I had an extra $100-200 to spare each month and I pumped that extra amount to the highest debt first. So let’s say the most highest debt I’m paying is around $500/month. So with that extra $100-200, I’m now paying back $600-700 to that debt. Takes patience and consistency. And once I’m done with that highest debt, i will go on to the second highest debt. Let’s say I’m paying around $350/month for the second highest debt, I now do have extra $600-700 since I cleared the first debt and pumped it in. And now I’m paying my second debt with $1000/month and clearing it even faster and so on and so fourth till I’m debt free. But once I’m debt free, I learnt to spent wisely. Hope this helps, let me know your thoughts about it. :)2 comments7"
2,David Morgan13 Jun 2019But my advices excludes emergency fund and spending. That’s when most would crumble with the consistency. And never ever default on your payments. Late fee interest can snowball if your debtor is standard chattered especiallyGabriel Tham13 Jun 2019Thank you for helping and sharing your experience! Glad you are debt free now!
3,"Charmaine Ng, The Value Maximizer at @ Every Ma La Xiang Guo StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Hi there. I went to one of CCS talks before with a friend who was very much in debt and was amazed at the people who worked there.. their knowledge and how much they have helped people in debt; whether the debt was circumstantial or due to foolishness in the past.Based on what I have learnt from the CCS session, it seems you look eligible to seek for their help. I suggest you register a spot at  https://www.ccs.org.sg/e-submission/index.php/member/site/info_register for the info talk. After this talk, if you feel that you want CCS to help you, you can contact them and furbish them with the information to contact you further. I understand a date will be arranged so there will be a face-to-face session to drill on your current income vs expenditures and to evaluate your eligibility to be in the program.What happen is underCCS DMP (Debt Management Plan), CCS will help negotiate with your creditors (the various banks only) for a lower % and an affordable payment loan tenure which will help reduce all those interests fees by a big bulk (many people can never repay due to interest vs anything else.)
Also according to my friend who attended the session and took up the plan eventually; that they scrutinize her spendings (be it family or personal) so much, that things she thought was normal isn't.. and they offered very good advices on how to turn things around. She is now repaying a comfortable payment every month without living on pay by pay basis and could actually start to prepare her life together with her  fiance (debt was a big obstacle back then)I hope you get all the help you need and learn more about CCS DMP here as well..! https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/credit-cards-line-credit-facilities-243/debt-management-programme-dmp-credit-counselling-singapore-ccs-5821687-53.html
This is the very thread that got me talking to my friend.. who then went with me to the info talk and got help~ Thing is though, you won't be able to get a credit facility at least until you've repaid your debts (why would you want to anyway?)0 comments3"

I applaud you for having the courage to come to terms with your financial situation. i think such courage will help you do whatever it takes to get out of your situation. some ideas i have:1) is it possible for you to cut back on your allowance to your parents from time to time? now that i am a father, i give my father $100 less on certain moments. if your parents could allow you to cut back for even $50, i think it will boost your morale if you channel that $50 directly towards repayment2) there is a FB group that advertises part-time work. is it possible for you or your wife to take on some assignments during the weekends?  https://www.facebook.com/groups/1687096224851730/?fref=nf 3) is there anything your wife could do to alleviate the pressure on grocery spending? for instance, i spend time doing surveys on this app called milieu. erm, because of my auntie tendencies, i also do surveys for Rakuten Insight Surveys. admittedly, it's slow going before i can gain enough points to redeem supermarket vouchers, but again, it boosts my morale when i use NTUC vouchers to pay for my groceries4) track your expenses for 3 months using the Seedly app and see where you can cut your expenses. perhaps lower the pocket money you give to your children? David Morgan already suggested to bring your own lunchbox to work. my wife cooks the entire afternoon on Sunday, so i bring my bento to work every Monday to Thursday.  every little bit helpsstay strong and never give up!0 comments1"

6,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 15 Jun 2019I second Charmaine's suggestion. You have to go to CCS and seek help. I think making 600 of payments will not reduce the principal, and I can foresee the interest (because interest on credit card debt is generally 24+++% per year) / late payment charges etc to just keep piling.At the moment the first is to stop the interest which I am guessing could be 2% x 23k = 460 per mth at least. Making 600 payment is only reducing the principal by 140 per mth.Second, you prob need to look through expenses and really aim to cut at least 50 per mth from somewhere. Take the last three months of your statements, and start looking through. First tip always - look at your handphone and cable / internet / Netflix etc subscriptions. How much are you paying for those? Mine is abt 200 for two lines, scv and internet. If you are paying more than 250 per mth for these, I am sure you can find something to cut, or perhaps even terminate entirely. I can be brutal upfront you wont have the luxury of watching tv in peace so you dont need cable tv or Netflix. You can watch at the community center.I am not sure how you make payments to your credit cards. My bank is with ocbc, and my credit cards are with ocbc, so I always login within first 5 days of each mth and setup payment instructions to pay one to two days before due date. If you are paying to different providers I would suggest this even be three days ahead of due date, in case they use some stupid reason and charge you late payment fees which is not small to be frank, I think its 50 at least?!?These are the immediate things you need to take care of to control the debt.By the way, you prob should start cutting up some of the cards. It would be tempting to max out to your credit card limit, but look through the terms and conditions of the cards. Find the one with the lowest interest rate and less fees listed in t&c. You are going to main on that card. Try to chop up all the rest.Btw I would suggest you talk with your family. 23k is 10x your take home income? Its really not small, if you have their support, it will really help you in tackling the issue. They may be willing to tighten the belt to help you tide through this.And if they do offer to lend you some money to pay down the debt/ control the situation, please be a nice guy and pay them interest at least of 3% per year (and they kinda got something better than a ssb). After all you are paying 24+++% to the credit cards, dont be mean to those willing to lend money to you.0 comments0"
7,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Jun 2019I think you really need to re-structure your whole plan. Aim to pay down debt ASAP. I would talk to everyone in the family to let them know the situation. You need buy in from everyone.Its a team effort. Please speak to the family. Your parents will need to cut down on some spendings etc. There's no choice unless you take another part time job.Your wife should be able to cook for you (and bring food to work everyday). Save whatever you can on expenses.Also go to  https://www.ccs.org.sg/ and talk to an advisor etc etc for more information.0 comments0"
