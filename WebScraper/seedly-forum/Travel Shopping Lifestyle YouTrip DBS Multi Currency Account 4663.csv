question,"Travel Shopping Lifestyle YouTrip DBS Multi Currency Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Jul 2019Among the multi-currency wallets available (YouTrip, UOB MightyFX, DBS MCA, RHB TravelFX), which one would allow me to get the best buck while in Europe?Will be travelling across Europe for a period of about 6 months.  Personally, I don't feel safe to carry 6 months worth of cash with me. Will be using YouTrip as long as cashless payment is supported. However, certain cities in Europe doesn't fully support cashless payment yet. On the other hand, I don't want to carry so many different currencies across Europe. What other option is there for me to avoid all those ATM withdrawal fee, interest fee, transaction fee, etc.?1 answerAnswerBump3"

GeniusUpdated on 28 Jul 2019I'm not sure about UOB Mighty FX and RHB TravelFX. but comparing DBS MCA to YouTrip; Based on what i have gathered and through my own experience, YouTrip tend to offer better rates with the least margin. On another note, i do personally feel that it's safer to use YouTrip instead of your own debit/credit card as a precautionary measure against theft as you can instantly lock your card from the app.DBS MCA does offer free overseas withdrawal, though quite a limited range of banks/locations. I believe that overseas ATM Withdrawal would only cost S$5 with the YouTrip card, a small price to pay for the additional security of not holding on to too much cash. It would also be prudent to bring along a backup card such as the DBS MCA that you can keep just in case you do lose the YouTrip card.0 comments4"
