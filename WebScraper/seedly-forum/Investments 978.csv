question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Jun 2019How do I change my CDP direct crediting service account?Can I just apply online or do I have to mail the form to CDP? I found the ""Apply for / Revoke Account Linkage"" form on the CDP website, but the form says to only choose one service type, linkage or revocation. Do I send 2 forms together, one revocation and one linkage?2 answersAnswerBump1"

1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 17 Jun 2019To change your DCS account, you need to use the 'Apply to CDP Services' form. Linkage form is meant to link/de-link your brokerage account to CDP and is not the form to be used in this scenario.1 comment9"

4,"Question Poster19 Jun 2019Thanks! Weird but I do not have this option to change it online. Only my current DCS account is shown at that page, nothing below. I have mailed the form to CDP and now it says ""Pending	1 Request"" below my current DCS account. Still not too sure if I did it right but I guess I will find out soon :)"
