It rewards 3mpd across many categories, like online shopping, food delivery, travel etc. It first reward you 1.2mpd and then the 1.8mpd after the card membership year.The catch?

Just like to highlight that, for miles chasers, there is no such thing as a one-card-settle-all thing. Different cards give different bonus for different categories of spend.
