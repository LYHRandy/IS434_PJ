1,"Tai Zhi, Chief Investment Officer at AutowealthLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 05 Mar 2019I have shared this during last Saturday's panel.The worst nightmare for investors who just got started is to take excessive risk, suffer a catastrophic loss, lost confidence and then never ever invest again.(1) Start low risk, build confidence before gradually increasing portfolio riskInvestors who just got started should go low risk first. Be patient. Go through a market correction to feel the market fluctuations and better understand your emotional resilience towards market volatility (ie fluctuations). When you gain more confidence and experience, gradually increase your portfolio risk to accelerate your wealth accumulation.(2) Invest broadly to diversify away riskDo not be too narrowly focused, diversify broadly so that specific market developments like U.S.-China trade tensions will not cause a catastrophic loss.Therefore, try to start off with a globally-diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds with a higher allocation to bonds. For example, you may consider starting with the AutoWealth Conservative Portfolio (60% global government bonds 40% global stocks) before switching to a portfolio with higher risk.Check out our blog posts for other useful investment insights and concepts: https://www.autowealth.sg/blog/0 comments0"
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019You need to see if you are able to stomach the volatility of some investments. Will you panic sell if the price drop? You should definitely take more risk in your earlier year as you will have lesser dependants.0 comments0"
