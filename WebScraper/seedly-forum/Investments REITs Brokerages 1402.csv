You may want to invested in a REIT or Fixed Income fund instead which you can manage through an international account and have your money sent to you with the strength of the Singapore Dollar in a multi-currency account. I have clients from India who are doing this, even though they have the best mutual funds in the world due to considerably lower history of forex risk and international portability.You can always drop me a message if you'd like.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
