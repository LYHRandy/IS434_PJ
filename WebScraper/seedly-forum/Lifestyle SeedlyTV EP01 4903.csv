1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Is it just on Grab (transport) or including Grab Food?If it's purely transport, and taking into account the fact that there aren't too many promo codes these days - try taking public transport! It might be difficult to switch at first, but you will grow used to it.I used to always take cabs in the past for the convenience, but there are some times where I would have reached my destination earlier if I had taken public transport. Thinking about those frustrating moments stuck in the cab (when I could have been reaching my destination earlier with the more predictable train schedule) also makes me choose public transport/walking over cabs :)0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Haha.. cos you like to be ferry alone from places to places ? :) Do try public transport, maybe at offpeak time, so less people, more relax, with seats, able to enjoy the scenery :) Most of all , save $200 every months and more ! :)0 comments0"
