God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Oct 2018AWT allows you to access world class funds that would normally only be recommended to accredited Investors.However, it costs higher than buying vanilla Unit Trusts yourself and locks you in for the premium term.There is flexibility in the plan but there are penalties for early withdrawals and termination. But with some of these funds, you can possibly generate above 12% returns consistently. If your advisor is not providing you with a solid portfolio when recommending the product, then they might not be the best to advise on it. 0 comments0"
