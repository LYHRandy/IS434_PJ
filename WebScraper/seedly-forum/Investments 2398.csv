But please get your emergency funds, insurance ready first and research before you start investing. Dont invest in things you dont understand at all.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019I think most of the comments here have emphasized that right now is always the best time to invest, but I would also like to say that preperation is the key to success. Investment in one's own education is the one that will provide the most return. Don't jump the gun right away to open up your CDP account and buy stocks (like I did), and end up getting burnt from investing in only the big names you can remember off the top of your head (which I learnt the hard way). Either way, a lesson is to be learnt by trying out the stock market, it's just a matter of it being the easy way, or the hard way.I highly suggest reading up first on stock analysis materials that you can find in libraries as well as online, and learning more about the fundamentals of analyzing company books, and relative valuation ratios. These will help you tremendously in building up your foundation and allowing you to properly evaluate your stock picks without overreliance on hearsay. Especially if you are heading to university, the materials in the Uni Library are gold mines waiting for you to explore them. But all in all, enjoy your time, and don't forget to always look to improve! i wish you all the best in your investment journey!0 comments0"

Before you invest, it is important to know what you are investing in and understand what exactly you are investing in. By investing early, you will also have more time to recover any loss. You can try doing dollar cost averaging since you are still young! just my opinion but its entirely up to you as to what you want to invest in! hope this helps!0 comments0"
