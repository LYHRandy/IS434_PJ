question,"CPF Retirement Asked by Alvin ChaiAsked 4w agoAre there any Malaysians, or Singaporean PRs, here contributing voluntarily into your Malaysia EPF account?The EPF has been giving more at 6% dividend over the past 5 years. Anyone here voluntarily do a cash contribution? If so, how do you do it? Do you trust that KWSP will not change any regulation regarding drawing out of your EPF funds? Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"JJefremy Level 3. WonderkidAnswered 4w agoWas reading into Malaysia's wonderful EPF funds today. IMHO Malaysia has seen how profitable it is to run such a scheme as Singapore does. 
The end product of these schemes always ends up the same. Eventually, you'll never get the total lump sum out, due to its nature of layering and the necessity of having a buffer on its investments. 
But having said that, it is government-linked, so unless both these countries want an all-out riot, the returns will be honoured. Over the long run, as a retirement option, IT IS good to place monies in EPF, right now better than CPF.1 comment2"
2,"Alvin Chai4w agoYea, the full withdrawal at age 55 is tempting. But we never know when then the goal post will change. Or will it ever change.
