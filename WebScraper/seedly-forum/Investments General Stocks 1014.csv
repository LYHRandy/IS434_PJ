1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Banks primarily profit through lending (money goes out so it's an outflow). Borrowers do not repay (inflow) full sum at one go, but smaller portions over time. So outflow will be more than inflow, hence negative. Negative cash flows shows that people are borrowing from these banks and in turn the banks will profit.0 comments1"
