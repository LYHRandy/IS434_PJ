1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You can join an IFA. There are a few in Singapore. I'm from Promiseland Independent one such IFA. And I suggest waiting on CFP and just taking the CMFAS exams first and get on the ground experience. Liking the industry and surviving the industry is a different game altogether. Prospecting and getting clients is the hardest part of the business and CFP doesn't help you with that. CFP is definitely good to have but not mandatory to start.2 comments1"
