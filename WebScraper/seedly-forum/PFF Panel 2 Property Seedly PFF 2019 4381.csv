WonderkidUpdated on 03 Mar 2019Unless you are extremely sure that you will not be selling this flat and moving to a new one, I would strongly recommend NOT to get the old flat that is above 40 years.Yes, cheaper, but depreciation for HDB flats are imminent after 40 years, which makes selling it in future a huge challenge + you would potentially be making losses.< 10 year old flats still have some depreciation, but not as much. (In fact, there was an article by CNA which allegdly mentioned that up to 10/20 years, HDB flats depreciate less than condos of a similar age)And depending on external factors (i.e. new MRT? new nearby amenities?) there may be a chance for appreciation. This has to look at URA's Master Plan to see if there's any potential. Otherwise, it's pretty tough.Of course, there are other factors to look at, and this suggestion is purely based on the provided context and how the financing of HDB flats work. Feel free to contact me for more information.0 comments1"

When buying an older flat, I second Zuhdy that you have to be sure that you won't need to sell either to cash out for retirement, or to upgrade to a new one.Make sure that you don't outlive the remaining lease of your flat too!Reason is because a HDB flat with a short lease depreciates very fast and is going to be very difficult to resell again.A newer flat however, can still retain it's value well.I would recommend not overstretching yourself though, if it's your first property. Go smaller, and upgrade later when the need comes.0 comments0"
