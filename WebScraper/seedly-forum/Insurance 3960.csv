1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019There are fee based IFAs and the more common commision based IFA. I'm the latter, but to be honest, being an IFA wouldn't mean that said person gives better advice than to a tied advisor just representing one insurer.But that being said, you do have the option once you have decided to implement the plan provided by the IFA, to have a look at almost all the available options in the market.Feel free to message me if you would like to hear my advice. Some fee based advisors that have lots of experience and have established themselves would be Wilfred Ling also from Promiseland and the people at Providend.2 comments3"
