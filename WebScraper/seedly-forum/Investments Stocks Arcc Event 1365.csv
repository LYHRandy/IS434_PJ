One approach would be: Form a conviction in a stock, and make a small position in it.It will:Accelerate your learning curve - because you are putting skin in the game, you are likely to learn all you can about the stock, even though it's your first timeBecause now you have dipped your toes in, the material you read (be it books/annual reports/analyst reports) will be more relevant. You will look for certain data points.You will also learn the emotional aspect of investing. Monitor how you reach when the stock dips/rises. How often do you check on the price? What is your own investment timeline? All these observations about yourself will help you learn.Hope this helps, and all the best!0 comments1"
