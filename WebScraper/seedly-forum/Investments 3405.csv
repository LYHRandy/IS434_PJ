1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018You'll need access to a broker that can allow you to trade stocks on the US market. Can look into thinkorswim or interactive brokers. The latter will require about $10k usd to start though. Books wise, you cannot borrow the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham from the library to learn more about stocks. Personally, I won't trade / hold stocks. Takes up too much capital. Prefer to manage an options portfolio which gives more consistent returns (in double digit terms). 0 comments0"
