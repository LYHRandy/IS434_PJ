1. Ppty tt can house u and ur future family
The ppty should be just big enough instead of the biggest even if you can afford it.Planning forward a 5rm is more expensive then a 4rm flat and ur children will usually move out as they start their own family.Cash is King and spend on what u need rather then herd instincts. With more cash after the MOP, you can buy pte ppty if absd is acceptable for u and the cash u saved from purchase can be the deciding factor.Shopback allows you to get cash back so use it to ur advantage like
A) honey koon
B) furniture
C) Electric EquipmentsUse the Savings wisely with income generating investment.When you have money and good habits, you will also start to spend money wisely and meaningfully with ur close ones.If u dun have money, and try to spend, it will nv be meaningful.Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments1"
