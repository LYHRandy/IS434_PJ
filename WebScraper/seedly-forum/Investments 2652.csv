question,"Investments Asked by Charmaine Lim XiaomeiAsked on 30 Aug 2018What happens after an accidental short sell?Just realised that I sold more shares (just 100 more) than I had ðŸ˜¢Understand that I will be subjected to SGX buy in on T+3 and will be based off 2 bids higher than the closing price of T+3. Other than that, there may also be a penalty (S$1000 or 5% of the value of the failed trade).Has anyone been fined before and is there a way to have the fine waived off?1 answerAnswerBump3"
