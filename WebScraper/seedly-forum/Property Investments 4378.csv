1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Historically, stock market returns history shows stocks to be a consistently-good wealth creator. For the US, historically housing prices has increased only slightly more than the level of inflation in the economy. Although the stock market has more booms and busts than the housing market, it has better overall returns. It is important to note that while stock prices and housing prices both reflect the market value of an asset, we should not compare the two for market returns. A stock is not tangible, physical asset and thus serves no utility other than a store of value. Whereas, properties serve tangible functions and is illiquid. Additionally, properties naturally lose value over time due to wear,tear and depreciation.0 comments1"
