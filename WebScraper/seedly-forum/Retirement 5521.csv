God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019CPF Life draws down your capital to 0.If you want to earn from that 100k and also pass it on to your next of kin, getting a private lifetime annuity is a better choice.You can easily get 6k a year from that 100k in 5 years time for life without reduction in your capital and touching the stock market.2 comments2"
2,"S125 Mar 2019From your example of $100K - To top up to Enhanced Scheme or get a private annuity.. If we accumulate the all cash benefits with the insurer for another 5yrs (total 10 yrs), how much will be payout be and how is it compared to CPF LIFE?  (In your opinion) if one have set aside FRS in RA, is it better to pledge property for the min BRS and use the cash to invest or buy an annuity instead of keeping it as FRS in RA for CPF LIFE?Hariz Arthur Maloy25 Mar 2019CPF Life pays more per month because you're paying from your capital. A private lifetime annuity makes sure that 100k is still intact. I rather my capital stay intact while earning less a bit especially since I have FRS already. And same answer for extra cash with pledging your property. You need to choose if you want a drawdown from capital or a dividend from your capital with no reduction."

 If you want to invest, how long do you intend to hold those investments? Would you need the $100k in the next 5 years? That will determine what products you can invest inKnowledge of investment 
Do you know how to invest? The CPF enhance scheme is like a dummy-proof hassle-free way of getting 4% near risk free interest on your money. The downside is you might not be able to withdraw it as conveniently when you want to.
