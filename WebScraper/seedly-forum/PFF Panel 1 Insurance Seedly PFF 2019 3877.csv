Every day you wait it becomes more expensive. Nobody is saying you MUST take the plunge, but you can consult a professional to see how it might complement your curent portfolio. For some people, it just won't. The budget won't fit. So that's all fine and dandy as well, but you never know until you try.  https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/early-critical-illness-failure-of-ci-insurance If you'd like to have a conversation about it, I'm contactable via my Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
