This you can keep $ at OA for 2.5% and better if you transfer some to SA to earn 4%. ​If you can invest and return more than 4% guaranteed, but the key is ""guaranteed"", then should invest yourself and continue to use OA to service you loan.  Do calculate if you can hit the CPF min sum first you decide to continue use CPF to service the loan. 0 comments0"

Otherwise the money would be stuck in cpf anyways until 65yo.​I’m considering this from the perspective that you like to have more cash flow in your later years.0 comments0"
