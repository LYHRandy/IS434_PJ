MoneySmart has an article which covers this, check it out in the link below. As for the payment frequency of your insurance premium, I'd recommend going for monthly payments so that you can hit the minimum spending of your credit card every month to qualify for the various rewards that you desire. https://blog.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/credit-cards-insurance-premiums-singapore/https://www.valuechampion.sg/best-credit-cards-insurance-premium-payment0 comments1"
