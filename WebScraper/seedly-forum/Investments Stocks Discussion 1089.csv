1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019TL;DR The firm has surprisingly strong financials, and there is a good chance the shares could be undervalued. I think that it is worth a closer look.Business ProfileSource: Yangzijiang GroupYZJ is a large corporate group, with shipbuilding and offshore engineering as its core business. They also have four additional sections: financial investment, metal trading, real estate and shipping combined ship-leasing as supplementary businesses. Interestingly, shipbuilding output from 2009 was continuously ranked top 5 of the Chinese shipbuilding industry. The average output, profit and tax were also impressively ranked at the top of Chinese shipbuilding companies. Source: Singapore Business ReviewIncome StatementThe profitability of the firm is very strong, with a net margin of more than 15%. Moreover, these margins have also substantially improved over time as well. The revenue and earnings of the firm also had quite a growth over the past few years, with the most significant change being for net profit. As a result, earnings per share have also risen. Balance SheetThe firm also has quite a strong balance sheet, with both very good short-term liquidity metrics as well as debt ratios. These ratios have also improved over time, which is a testament to the strength of their balance sheet. Free CashflowFree Cashflow to the firm for 2018 was quite high, with the FCF margin being  a high of 23.2%. This was a result of several factors. The NOPAT of the firm had improved over the last few years, while a decrease in working capital also result in more free cash flow. With lower debt levels, there is also more free cash flow available for shareholders. Given their strong cash flow position, I do believe that the firm will be able to sustain their dividends in the long run with a stable payout ratio. Efficiency MetricsThe firm's efficiency is also surprisingly good. These metrics have also improved quite a bit since 2016. The high ROE can be attributed primarily to the high net profit margin, but also due to the good asset turnover as well. As the change in net working capital had been negative, the reinvestment rate was negative for the year. If we hold ROC as constant, this would lead to a decrease in the earnings for the firm the next year. ValuationThe P/E ratio of the firm is on the lower end, which could be good indicator for value investors. For slightly higher multiples, such as P/B ratio, have good companion variables such as the ROE that might justify a higher valuation. For firm value multiples, the companion variables also support the different forms of valuation. All in all, there could be a chance that the shares of these firm are undervalued. Cost of CapitalThe cost of capital for the firm is high due to the company being more exposed to higher country-specific risk (China). This leads to a high cost of equity which then results in a higher cost of capital despite a low cost of debt. However, due to the company's high ROIC, the ROIC exceeds the cost of capital significantly. This suggests that the firm is generating much more capital than it costs for investors. Global Market-Wide Regression As the title suggests, a regression had been carried out on the different multiples based on each multiples fundamentals. Interestingly the shares of the firm seem undervalued when we look at both P/B and P/S ratio. Conversely, the firm seems potentially undervalued when we pay attention to the EV/Invest Capital ratio. The other multiples seem to fall quite neatly near the range of their estimates.1 comment4"
