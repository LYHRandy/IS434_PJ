WizardAnswered on 24 May 2019The REIT etf is a basket of REITs, so if the market downturn affects every REIT in the etf, the etf will react accordingly.Having a basket of REITs also protects you from having to subscribe to individual rights issue or a collapse of a single REIT. You get some form of diversification.The etf will rebalance accordingly if there is a rights issue to maintain the portfolio allocation for each reit.0 comments1"
