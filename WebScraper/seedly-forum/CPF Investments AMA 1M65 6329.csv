question,"CPF Investments AMA 1M65 Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 Nov 2018How to improve my investment strategy after using dollar cost averaging since 2004?I am 36 this year. I have been buying STI ETF using cost averaging method since since 2004. I also have also maxed out my SA since 5 years back. Apart from paying for my monthly housing loans using my OA, I have been transferring my remaining OA monies to both my parents' RA. I am proud that both have about $60k - $$70k in their RA, when they started with hardly any monies in RA. How else can I optimise my investment strategy?1 answerAnswerBump1"

I am not a big believer of DCA not because of its poor effectiveness, but I simply cannot bring myself to buy stocks when the prices are high and expensive. I am just a person who love market crashes, and when I catch one, I go aggressive on it. But one has to be very patient and thrifty to save for a day like this.  And you have to be gutsy when it happens and enter when there is blood in the street. 0 comments1"
