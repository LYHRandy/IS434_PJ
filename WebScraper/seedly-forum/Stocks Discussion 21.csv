God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi there, if your $x was refunded in full, it means you didn't get any allocation. So it won't be showing up on your statements.You will have to buy from the stock market should you wish to get it.2 comments4"
2,"Question Poster2w agoThanks for the clarification Elijah!Elijah Lee2w agoWelcome. It's gone up now, so I personally would wait for a pull back, as well as to assess the REIT's method of raising funds in future (private placement or will they give retail investor rights issues to participate) before I decide. They only have 2 properties now after all."

Guess it's really over-subscriptionErnest Yeam Wee Leong2w agoThe allocation was probably geared towards users who bidded for less 10,000 shares to have as many investors to have ownership in it
i bidded 5000 shares and got 2000 whereas a friend put up 20,000 shares but got none instead.
you can get it from open market if you think the price is still undervalued or reasonable"
