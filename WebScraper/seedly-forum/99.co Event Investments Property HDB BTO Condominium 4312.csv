1,"Douglas Chow, Chief Enlightenment Officer at Empower AdvisoryLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Yeah that is the first obstacle to overcome. Douglas here. 2nd keynote speaker.No rocket science here. A high paying job, or a good business of your own to accumulate ammo for the first downpayment. Maybe u can buy the occasional TOTO or 4D. you might get lucky. My Dad won some pretty big prizes there so I speak from experience. But I'm not suggesting you to become a TOTO/4D junkie!! It goes to support charities and our sports people, so it's not a bad thing really.And pls avoid all the get rich scams out there. The internet and facebook is crawling full of such scams, out to rip u off. Stay alert. And sober.A discipline to save up is key. It doesn't matter that you earn 10k/mth when your expenditure in the same period is 12 k. Cut down or eliminate unnecessary expenses like bubble tea, starbucks or clubbing. And no , you don't have to live like a monk.You can always combine resources with trusted friends but make sure you have the same goals and agree on when to exit the investment.​​​
