1,"Lim Wei Siang, Financial Consultant at Advisors Alliance Group - Aia FaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 08 Mar 2019Investment comes in different forms. There is no best investment but consider these few factors:Why are you investing?What is your risk appetite?How long are you willing to invest/stay invested?How much are you comfortable investing?Self managed vs 3rd party managed?What are the charges to investment products?DO NOT follow blindly. Actions leads to reactions/consequences. Knowledge gives birth to choices. Only when you are aware of the different choices, different consequences can you then make a decision where the consequences are something bearable.0 comments2"

Grand MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019RSP is a good, boring way to invest and retire well.There are many other exciting ways but could make you poorer. :)If you have to, you can, but use only a small portion of your total investment portfolio so you would not cry when you lose big.I believe you feel weird because it has been a  consistent bull run in the past few years, RSP on blue chips is a great consistent method over BULLS and BEARS market.wait till you go through one full bear and then bull market you will appreciate RSP and the stability in the long run.0 comments1"
