WizardAnswered on 10 Dec 2018Most meaningful gift without spending lots of $: your time and attention Spend some time together have a meals , a walk in the park or anywhere scene. We only have limited amount of time and attention in modern days,  which is the most precious gift you can give to anyone and create good lasting memories üòÑüëåüëç0 comments1"
3,"Huang YixuanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Dec 2018How about something homemade? I don't think the amount you spend matters (unless she is materialistic then why be with her??). For me the best gift would be a sincere letter, and maybe if you take her out to say, Sentosa to see the sunrise with a picnic basket. Depends on your girl really :P 0 comments1"

Personally I think nothing is more special than someone really taking the time to write a card/letter. You can also cook for her, or take her to somewhere interesting that she's more inclined to like where both of you can enjoy the experience! 0 comments0"
