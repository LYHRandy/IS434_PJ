God of WisdomAnswered on 11 Dec 2018Comaparison of yield for Male Age 40, 10 year premium term, 20 year payout term for a guaranteed Retirement Income of $500/mth. Aviva MRC: Guaranteed: 2.53%pa Projected: 4.44%pa Total Premiums Paid $61504NTUC RevoRetire: Guaranteed: 2.07%pa Projected: 4.25%pa Total Premiums Paid $70151Aviva MRC has more flexible options in premium term and payout term. NTUC has higher death benefit during retirement years. I'd opt for Aviva MRC because bonuses are also paid out during the retirement years unlike NTUC where it pays you a maturity benefit.0 comments1"
