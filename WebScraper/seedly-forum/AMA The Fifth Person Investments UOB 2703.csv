1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Hi, When it comes to investment there is no ""Guaranteed"". Every investment have a risk and you have to read the term sheet properly on how they derive the 11%. You may want to consider Singapore Saving Bonds, as they have better interest than putting your money in the bank. Moreover, SSB minimum lock up period is only one month unlike the above scheme which required you to lock up for 6 years.0 comments0"

GeniusUpdated on 17 Feb 2019Quote "" Total Guaranteed Minimum Interest of 11%* of the Principal Amount over 6 years (equivalent to an effective interest rate of 1.84364% _a year)"". _This is worst case scenario.The best case scenario (fulfills all requirements) pays extra bonus, for max 13.25% for average ~2.095..%Hmmm. the next tranche of SSB will average 2.04% if u hold for 6years. So SSB beats the worse case scenario hands down. In the best case scenario, will barely beat SSB. But probably high chance might not get the maximum payout, so SSB has a high chance to beating it.SSB u can unwind anytime(monthly) without penatly, structured deposit u will not be able to unwind your trade without significant loss.SSB is guaranteed by singapore government, the structured deposit is backed by credit of UOB.SSB can choose to hold longer for higher coupon payout if u do not need the money. For the structured deposit, u suffer from reinvestment risk once it matures as u might not get to reinvest at a similar rate.I do not feel it is worth it to invest in the structured deposit. The upside do not justify . Unless u are a very high networth person who have already maxed out your SSB quota.Do add me on FB if u wish to discuss further.0 comments0"
