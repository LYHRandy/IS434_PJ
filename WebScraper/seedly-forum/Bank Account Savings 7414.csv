question,"Bank Account Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 May 2019Which bank account is the most suitable for me and has the highest interest rate?I am a freelancer and have a saving about 200k SGD, I am using 50k for travel and investment, I rest the other 150k in the bank as I am planning to buy a HDB together with my parents who are both working overseas and they are still not sure when they will retire(they told me the earliest is within next 2years but also possible to stretch up to 5years.) My situation is that I don't have regular income, my monthly spending usually don't exceed 600, and I don't like to own any credit cards.3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 18 May 2019I currently have my Citi Maxigain savings account topped up to 100k (because beyond 150k, you don't avail the step-up interest of 2%). Currently that gives me the best interest rates with no hassle of minimum spending etc. For the rest, I use Standard Chartered Bonus Savers account (but am not liking the minimum card spend), and the rest I have in CIMB for all the rest of it.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 19 May 2019For high yielding bank accounts without any spending criteria, citibank's maxigain and cimb fast saver are the best. Can consider Singapore savings bonds as well just that it will take a month to withdraw funds if needed. You may want to consider splitting this pool of 150k between citibank and ssb as 150k is the threshold limit to earn the best interest under maxigain. I.e. If you put everything into maxigain and the next month's interest crediting causes the balance to go beyond 150k, the base interest will be drastically cut.Hope this helps0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 18 May 2019If you are not planning to touch the money frequently, you can consider CITI maxigain savings account which will currently give 2.48% interest with at least SGD 70k and up to SGD 150k after 12 months of step up interest. If you were to withdraw the money, the interest will be reduced. Singapore Savings Bonds is also something you can consider. https://www.citibank.com.sg/gcb/deposits/mxgn-savacc.htm0 comments0"
