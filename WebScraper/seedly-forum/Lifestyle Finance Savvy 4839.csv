Then save, save and save.My mum has no issues with us splurging occasionally, as long as we keep to the basic rule. If you want something you can‚Äôt afford, you save for it.0 comments0"
3,"Jansen Ng, Business Student at NtuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For me, its the mindset of frugality despite being okay-to-do. 
Like keeping coupons (haha not so much now), going for cheap deals, search for cheapest place to buy that item, 1-for-1 promotions, dont buy things i dont need:) These mindset helps me to cut down ny expenses:)2 comments0"
4,"Yu Ming Jin12 May 2019Being frugal in the right areas. My mum was from a village in Malaysia. Money was really tight then and her life experiences imbued the principle of frugality. However, she spared no expense on areas such as education, which he perceives it as the best investment one can have (she only has a secondary school education, which has limited her ability to gain better employment opportunities in the past).Jansen Ng12 May 2019Yeaa good point!"
