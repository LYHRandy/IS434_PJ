Make sure for insurance at least get hospitilization insurance. If you going to quit to go full time study, you can do part time job for more money and pay your insurance. If your company have restriction, you have to do your own research to see what you want to invest in and not included in the restriction. You do not have to limit yourself to just Singapore investment.  You can buy ETF overseas as well.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 21 Dec 2018In relation to continuing to pay for your insurance  - you should continue to do so anyway because it's cheaper when you start younger. Don't worry about paying for it because its unlikely you'll remain jobless forever, so just make sure you have as many years of premium payments available as you intend to work. If you're looking at growing your wealth, you can consider a diversified portfolio 
that yields between 7 - 11% net of fees a year, especially since prices are so low now. Since you don't have a lot of experience, you may want to start from funds that pay you steady dividends and have low volatility. Just please don't start with the STI. https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/sti-etf-not-good-beginnersIf you'd like some advice on that, you can always nudge me. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
