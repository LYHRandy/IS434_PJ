Plus, im considering more like career switch to the ""hype"" industries like big data, etcLok Yang Teng20 Nov 2018hmm...i think if you're faster ones to pick up the skill, there's exclusivity and you're at comparative advantage. Maybe a few years down it'll become the norm and those without it are not really considered."
