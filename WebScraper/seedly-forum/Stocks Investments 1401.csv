Grand MasterAnswered on 08 May 2019When choosing individual stocks always ensure that the stock you are picking for suit your portfolio strategy and is aligned with your asset allocation. Ultimately its never about one individual stock. Itâ€™s always about how this stock fits into your portfolio. So look at how the stock will fit into your portfolio strategy, depending on your desired portfolio strategy how you look and value a stock will also be slightly different.0 comments2"
