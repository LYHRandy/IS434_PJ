1,"Jonathan Ng, Economics at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 10 Jun 2019Hello!The OCBC Blue-Chip Investment provides you with 20 counters to choose from (which is a good number) and you can start from as little as $100/month.If you are looking to engage in fuss-free dollar-cost averaging at an affordable amount then this is the plan for you! (fuss-free as you can automate the investment deduction) It also has one of the lowest charges in comparision with the other competitors.They currently have a promotion (until 30 Jun) where you get $20 cashback if you invest in 1 or more counters for 3 consecutive months.There was also an article on Seedly that compared between the 3 providers of Regular Shares Savings Plan:OCBC Blue-Chip Investment PlanDBS Invest SaverPhillipCapital Shares Builder PlanHope this helps!0 comments2"
2,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 12 Jun 2019Choose a counter that you are familiar with. There are 20 counters you can take a look here https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/bcip-counters-list.pdfInvest in an amount you are comfortable with per month. But do take note on fees. Fees are $5 or 0.3% of investment monthly amount whichever is higher. So if you invest $100 per month and you are being charged $5, your fees are 5% of your capital. If you invest $2,000 per month, your fees will be cap at $5 which equates to about 0.25% of your capital. Even though I understand most will want to save on the fees, but the first thing that you would want to know is how long are you intending to invest and what is the comfortable amount you will want to invest in. Irregardless of whether you can save the most of the fees, getting started will be more important.2 comments2"
3,"T@Takingstock @12 Jun 2019Actually if I am not mistaken, once the monthly contribution is abt 1700, it triggers the other rule based on 0.3% and not $5 anymoreVincent Tan Wen Bin12 Jun 2019Oh yes! Thank you for pointing that out. The lowest we can get is 0.3% for the fees"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Won't touch it. The breadth of counters available pale in comparison to maybank ke's soon to be defunct MIP. There are many good counters out there, such as the mapletree reits that are not available under ocbc's plan. Until something similar to ke's MIP surfaces, I may just hold off doing dca into local market stocks and channel the funds to my offshore account instead.0 comments1"
