1,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 18 Oct 2018It would be Ideal, however, you probably need to set aside a misc savings fund for misc items along the way, e.g. gifts, occasional splurging, etc. plus an additional saving if you plan to have vacation.the rest will be your investment funds, however, you shouldn't invest all in your investment funds. but gradually invest, leaving a mobile sum in your investment fund for deployment, when you find a good deal.Nothing is worst then the market going down and you not having the cash to buy stocks at the best price.

2,"Soh Sing Heng, Financial Blogger at SG Young InvestmentLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yes I would want to invest most of my savings as much as possible. I will also have a war chest to deploy if market goes down. My strategy is to buy when companies are selling at good value or undervalued and sell when companies are overvalued. 1 comment3"
