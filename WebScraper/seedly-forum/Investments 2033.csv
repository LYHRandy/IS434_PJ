1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 25 Mar 2019I once read this book called Gone Fishing with Buffett. Inside, the author described a scene where there was an on-going recession. ""Buffett"" then asked the author to head on to the malls to observe and identify brands.The author noticed grocery stalls still having hordes of people. Similarly with fast food chains. People still have to spend, hence your payment technologies i.e. Credit cards. But luxury and branded stores has a significant reduction in human traffic flow. When one falls ill, one still has to visit the doctor although, depending on the seriousness of the sickness, they may head on to more affordable medical outlets i.e. PolyclinicsSo, the moral of the story is, think of what a general consumer cannot do without in their everyday lives (even in a recession) -Staples, Transport, Food.0 comments2"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Mar 2019Definitely Healthcare, consumer staples and ultilities. Now I wouldn't call them absolutely recession proof per say, but they do have really low betas, meaning they aren't sensitive to the movements of the market. So when the market goes down, these industries may not go down at all, or may go down just alittle, as a reflection of reduced spending power of the economy and slightly lowered demand for these goods. But usually, since they are part of our basic needs, they shouldn't go down by much.0 comments1"
3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Healthcare, vice, and consumer staples. These are more defensive industries. A full on recession will of course still affect them, but less so than technology for example.0 comments0"
4,Guo Hao TeoLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 10 Mar 2019Some would say Commodities and FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) because food is something that people will have to eat even in a recession. Ideally itâ€™s towards the more common man segments (eg milo and maggi mee)Nestle has been a very good example of this.0 comments0
