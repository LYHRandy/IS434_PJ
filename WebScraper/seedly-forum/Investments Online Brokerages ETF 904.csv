MasterAnswered on 16 Jun 2019Similar to Kenneth, I use FSM One as well and the main reason is the tranferring of money. I noticed that other brokerages either utilises Wire transfer or cheque but FSM One allows bank transfers using FAST which allows same day transfer, saves the hassle of having to write a cheque etc.0 comments1"
