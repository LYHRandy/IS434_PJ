1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019There are a few ways you can do this. You could consider buying interest rates futures contracts on government bonds or interest rates futures. However, this may not be accessible to a more beginner investor who do not understand how this works. Something else to consider is also buying to high-yield bonds or floating-rate bonds that can give you better returns than safer investment grade bonds. Buying gold might be something to consider also, since the prices of gold might rise as interest rates rise. Moving to equities might also be better since they tend to generate better returns than the market, but are definitely also risker than bonds also.0 comments0"
