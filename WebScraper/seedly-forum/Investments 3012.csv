4,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Sep 2018Diversification is to spread the risk so that you wouldnt lose all your assets if one sector falls. Some may argue that if you know what you are doing, you do not need to diversify. If you just starting out, diversification between sectors and asset type is recommended since market is always unpredictable.0 comments0"
