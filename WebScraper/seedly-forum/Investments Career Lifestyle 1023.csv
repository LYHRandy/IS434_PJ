1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 09 Jun 2019I recommend Overdrive - it allows you to borrow ebooks AND audiobooks from your local public library. For us Singaporeans, this means NLB but it works for our friends overseas too. It's free, since it's a borrowed book.It's legal and you don't need to worry about any shady activities. Fuss free to use.2 comments1"

The above listed sites are free to download for people who'd like to pick up new skills but do not have the financial means to do so :)3 comments0"

For beginners 
Gone fishing with Buffett 
What I enjoy about this book is how simplified the author makes the theory of investments seem with the usage of analogies.

9,"See all 3 comments Gabriel Tham09 Jun 2019Plus, those popular one have to queue...which is stupid considering its an ebook, you technically can have millions of copies but they limit itSiow Nan09 Jun 2019It's not stupid cos you are not paying for the rights to read it. They only have limited digital rights and its paid by taxpayers money. You can always borrow another ebook first while waiting for your desired book"
