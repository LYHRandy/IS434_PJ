question,"Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Aug 2019Need advice on getting a resale flat after 4 unsuccessful BTO applications?My bf and I have been unsuccessful in applying for our BTO for 4 times now. We didn't even get a queue number for a non-mature estate. We've been renting for about a year and we're trying to decide if we should put our 'rent' money to a resale flat instead of waiting for a BTO (which will take 3-4 years). Assuming that there is no increase in rental, it will amount to 40K. What should our decision be? Any advice?4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Jessica ChuahLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 20 Aug 2019Hi! I am in the exact situation as you and in fact, had 8 unsuccessful BTO/SBF attempts so my fiance and I gave up. What we did was to go into the resale market to find my flat with my fiance instead of renting, as I would rather own a property and pay off the mortgage instead of renting a flat, but that is my personal preference. From what I see, the $40k could actually go into the downpayment of a resale flat.Going for a resale does have its merits as you will be able to enjoy grants: $50k for 4 room or smaller flats$40k for 5 room and larger flats$20k if you choose a flat near one of your parents$30k if one of your parents move in with youThis will subsidise your flat purchase quite a lot. Resale flats might be older but I would say I have no regrets purchasing mine, just do your homework to research on the recent transacted prices of your shortlisted regions and do check out various blogs or property websites (eg. 99.co) to find out what to look out for when purchasing a resale flat. After a couple of viewings, you and your bf will be able to find out your preferences which will help in the process of shortlisting and later offering the seller a price.That being said, do ensure that you are ready to commit to paying monthly mortgage loans and also for the downpayment of the flat before going into it. Otherwise, you can still consider waiting till you get a BTO and still rent meanwhile if you prefer a newer unit. All the best!1 comment3"

Go to the meet the people's session in your estate and share with him the problem you are facing.From there, you would be able to get him/her to write in to HDB on your behalf and you'd be able to make something happen.If you actually head down you will find alot of young couples there as well. Cheers!P.S I tried to get for 7 BTOs but unsuccessful but my eight was :)1 comment1"

WonderkidUpdated on 22 Aug 2019The important question to ask yourself now is: What Are Your Immediate Needs?If your bf and you are looking for a matrimonial home to start a family, then getting a Resale flat will be advisable.Like others have mentioned, BTO is more for couples who can wait while having a place to stay and save up. But this is not your case.The current maximum grants for Resale flat is $120k and Lawrence Wong has recently announced there is upcoming benefits change next month. My opinion is there may be an increase in grant which will be good news for you.https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2903013039740020&id=1921301174950060 comments0"

GeniusUpdated on 02 Sep 2019Hi OP,Sorry to hear of your case.The way I see it, if you are ready to foot the bill of a resale flat, it would be better for you to do so.BTOs are more for couples who can afford to wait by staying in their parents' house and saving during the 3-4 years wait for the collection of keys of the BTO.While BTO flat may be cheaper than the resale units by 20-60k, many will cost to do rennovation which will cost quite a bit. Furnishing said BTO would also be an expensive endeavour, requiring big-ticket items like aircon, wiring, ceiling fans, water heater etc.In this manner, whatever ""savings"" you get from BTO can be easily wiped out by the cost of making it livable to your taste. Also, as you mentioned, you are currently renting a room together, which would add to the cost of ""waiting"".On the other hand, resale flats are more for couples who want a place of their own, as the units are already rennovated, and in a ""ready to move in"" condition- the seller might even leave appliances and furniture behind, as the cost of relocating such used items may be too high and they would prefer to get new ones.Resale also has a wider choice, and you can use the free market to browse around and negotiate for a better price!In conclusion, you should ask yourself for a place of your own, you are okay to foot the bill for a resale flat right away, or would you prefer to wait and potentially, spend more on renovation and furnishing your BTO.End of the day, all we want a place to call home!Cheers,Zen1 comment0"
