1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018There's always value to be found. I'm a believer of crytocurrencies and blockchain technology and don't think it is too late at all, in fact prices are so cheap right now vs all the advancements that have happened in the last few months! But beware of shitcoins and crypto scams cos there's a lot. Get educated and research first!! 0 comments1"
