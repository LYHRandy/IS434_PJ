WonderkidAnswered on 22 Aug 2019To the first part of your question, I recommend that you first educate yourself, learn as much as you can about Bitcoin, Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies and only put in small amounts, call it ""beer money"" if you will. Test the waters. Don't go wild.Some videos I used to learn more are:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1si5ZWLgy0https://youtu.be/RplnSVTzvnUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpj_P4Dp5kUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl8OlkkwRpcSome exchanges that you can use fairly easily in Singapore are:Gemini: https://gemini.com/Binance Singapore: https://www.binance.sg/enCoinHako: https://www.coinhako.com/Also, I would recommend storing your coins outside of exchanges using a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-sWith regard to JP Morgan Coin or JPM, it isn't really a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. It isn't decentralised. It is fully controlled and owned by a centralised entity. In this case, a bank called JP Morgan.JPM Coin is essentially a tool to help with the instantaneous transferring of payments between some of JPMorgan's clients. In order for an exchange of money between client parties to take place over a blockchain ledger, digital currency must be used to facilitate the transaction. JPM Coin is the tool which helps to complete that process in a more efficient manner than traditional settlements.JPM Coin itself is not money in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a digital token which represents U.S. dollars which are held by JPMorgan Chase. It maintains a value equal to one USD. Assuming that JPMorgan Chase deems the initial launch of JPM Coin to be successful, the bank has indicated its plans to use JPM Coin for additional currencies as well in the future.You can learn more from these resources:https://www.investopedia.com/jpmorgan-to-launch-jpm-coin-4587182https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPM_Coinhttps://www.jpmorgan.com/global/news/digital-coin-payments0 comments1"
