Currently the franchise owner is HanBaoBao Pte Ltd. Singapore pools, sadly, no more opening for franchise. It is just too lucrative so they want to keep it all to themselves.For 7-11 and others, you can check out seedly article:  https://blog.seedly.sg/how-real-is-your-franchising-dream-in-singapore/0 comments0"
