1,"Tee Hon EngLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I have considered when Monaco(now crypto.com) was going to be introduced in SG, news back in Nov 17. The launch took so long that the currently price of bitcoin is 1/3 of back then.I am holding on to their free visa card but does not have intention to deposit money (buy crypto) as the value flutuates greatly.The selling point previously was the ability to transact in foreign currencies without fees. Now, with YouTrip or DBS multi-currency account, idea is no longer selling itself.1 comment1"
