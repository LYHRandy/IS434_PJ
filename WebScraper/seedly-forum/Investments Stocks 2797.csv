2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Feb 2019You should start from blogs and google first to understand the basics. Then once you understand then you decide if you wan to go for classes. It will be more beneficial for you if you go to the classes with some knowledge than not knowing anything. Remember you have to not only learn about stock trading. You have to also learn about emergency fund, risk appetite, asset allocation and so on. It is all related to personal finance and its important to have some knowledge so that you can maximize your profit and also reduce your risk and losses if it occur.0 comments0"
