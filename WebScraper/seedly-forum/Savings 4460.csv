question,"Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Sep 2019How should I financially prepare myself for university studies?I am currently serving NS (and thus receiving a steady stream of income). I will ORD soon and have a long break before I begin my university studies next July/August. How can I prepare myself for university studies in terms of my financials, such as how much should I save before university starts, having an emergency fund and how much, assuming that my tuition fees are taken care of?1 answerAnswerBump0"

Serve And F.... inish your duty.Wow, you have a long break. I will say take some jobs that you can enjoy, to have more cash in the bank. Any cash is good to spend later in your university life (for studies, for part-time biz or just to save up)No job is too menial, given your age... if you have to be a food delivery, go for it. But do step back and see what job you can do that will maximise your salary (I say a tuition teacher earns more than food deliverer), or increase your experience in skillsets or experience.(I will go for a sales job. Sales is a great thing to learn when you are young and thick skin)Just don't waste the break playing for many months. you can still play during the weekend or evenings.If you have spare cash, go backpacking when you have a bit of money. Backpacking is cheap (with budget airlines and living in a hostel) and widens your love for this world.In fact, yeah this is my best suggestion, backpack for 1 or 2 mth once you can afford it.0 comments2"
