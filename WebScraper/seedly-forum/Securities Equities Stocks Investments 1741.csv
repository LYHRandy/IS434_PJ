MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019Most elections tend to run the same way - they either leave stocks falling a little or stagnant, and tend to bounce back up once its been decided for a while.But its extremely hard to time and the market may move in a completely different direction from the winner predicted. For the US, the market went up with Donald Trumps victory despite millions - literally millions - of articles and predictions that it would go down. So don't bother figuring it out  and stay invested.0 comments2"
