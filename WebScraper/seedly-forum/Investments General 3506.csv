MasterAnswered on 08 Aug 2018In terms of maximising finances, I assume that you would want to have a better way of allocating your finances.​Here are some tips:1) Ensure that you are adequately covered by Insurance 2) Consider educating yourself stock investments and participate in value investing 3) Reduce unnecessary expenditure on certain habits such as smoking, gambling, drinking (if you practice any of those)4) Not sure of how much you make in a month, but you can also consider parking part of your pay cheque in SRS to reduce your taxes5) You may want to keep more money in your OA in the event that you would like to purchase a property in the slightly further future.​0 comments0"
