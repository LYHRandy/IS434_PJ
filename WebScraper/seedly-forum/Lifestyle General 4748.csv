1,"Josh NgLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 06 Jul 2019For what it's worth, it's not just the wealthy who has the network of connections. Rich or not, anyone can build a right profile of themselves professionally and build a network based on merit. I don't think people necessarily  think of connections as a means to get something directly, rather it is a case when you need some help or inspiration then you decide within your circle of peers or friends whom you can reach out for the 'best' advice). That said, I would say common use of connections would be understanding a particular industry that you are less accustomed to, making in roads to a new job and getting some tips to succeed, and knowing acquaintances (usually friends of friends).0 comments2"
