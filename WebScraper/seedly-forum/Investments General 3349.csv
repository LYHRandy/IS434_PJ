MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018You can do dollar cost averaging to the STI at 100 a month that is the cheapest way to start investment ​I think you should change your focus from “consider wealthy “ to a sustainable lifestyle ​your lifestyle will determine how much money you send and that would be in a direct relation to how much you earn.​As Long as you keep you expenses in check and not live a lifestyle that you can’t afford then you are in a stable state.​​0 comments0"

If you have more money, you can invest in others. Read up on books to learn more. But if you're new I will say read on financial blogs. Bite sized informations are easier! 0 comments0"

7,"ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Honestly speaking there isn't a minimum sum which you need accumulated in your bank to start investing, but often you should have a couple of months of emergency savings to tide over any storms which might hit you before jumping into investments! Wealth is relative, it depends on how much you require to live comfortably, so if you're frugal you would probably need less emergency savings; likewise if you're a spendthrift and can't do without daily meals at high end restaurants with family, you'd probably need a greater amount of emergency funds.0 comments0"
8,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Jul 2018If you are a salaried worker, start with using higher interest savings account, which rewards you for crediting salary into the account, e.g DBS Multiplier, UOB One or OCBC 360 or BOC. Different bank has different criteria to fulfill so it's hard to advise you without knowing your monthly spend profile, how much savings you plan to set aside to earn the higher interest. Next would be to build emergency fund which can be 6 months of your expense. Afterwards can start to venture to investment. 0 comments0"
