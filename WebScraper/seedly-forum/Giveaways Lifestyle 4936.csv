3,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Distributor at Newbrand Organic Green TeaLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 12 Mar 2019My favourite Personal Finance Tool is Grab App, as I mainly use it as payment method for dining out via GrabPay or Fave using Grab credits. I also recently use it to purchase a pair of Cathay movie ticket vouchers at $9.50 each without booking fee, which can be redeemed for first-week title movie tickets on a weekend (usual price $13.50).The following images are example of me purchasing a voucher via Grab and then use it to redeem at Cathay (""Marvel Studios' Captain Marvel"" is a first-week title movie, and no booking fee).0 comments1"
