And if yes, what sort of portfolio would you recommend, assuming a recession might hit us soonish?1 answerAnswerBump2"

Do you want to sit around and wait? going into fixed income and gold comes with a certain risk too. For example, gold price is purely determine by supply and demand. How do you know if you enter at the right price? You can try less risky products like Singapore Savings Bonds or if you are paying tax, how about reducing your tax by topping up CPF under Retirement Sum Top-Up (RSTU)? But if you really want to hold on to cash, i would recommend SSB. At least the cash gain some petty interests to counter inflation. Cheers!Martin Loh11 Jul 2018Cool, thank you for your input. Much appreciated!"
