1,"Ivann FokLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 03 Mar 2019If you’re relatively young and still have a long way to go before retirement. You would be much better off NOT contributing to CPF. Buy a ton of stocks instead. This is because with 20 to 40 years of your working life left to go, you have a higher tolerance for investment risk. Even if the market crashes, you do not need the money immediately because you are still working. Hence you will not need to sell your stocks at a loss. You can hold your stocks and wait for the market to rebound because TIME is on your side. With the S&P500’s annualised return of 10% on average, you will retire with much more money buying stocks than contributing towards CPF.0 comments1"

You will need to direct the investments yourself. But you'll get tax relief for every dollar u topped up (max $35.7k) per year.  Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your SRS account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money,  The higher your tax bracket, the higher your effective return.0 comments0"
