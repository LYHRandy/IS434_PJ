1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 29 Apr 2019There's a saying called ""Sell in May and Go Away""Partially, as what Wen Hao has accurately mentioned, May is when many counters would go Ex-Dividend, causing markets to fall.And if you take a look at DBS's 52 week highs vs. lows (highlighted in the red box)Do you personally feel that DBS can go past $30? And if your answer is yes, how long would that take?My take is that at its current price, the upside of DBS is relatively low as compared to downside, I'll wait for prices to head back down to perhaps in the $25-$26 regions0 comments3"

If you have been tracking this stock you'll realised that there has been a sudden spike early this month. I suppose one of the push factor is because of the 60 cents dividend coming next week. Usually the stock price will fall more than the payout after the xd.0 comments0
