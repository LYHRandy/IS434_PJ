1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered 2w agoExecution ALWAYS matters more than ideas. Ideas are cheap/free - what matters is the courage, dedication and grit to see your business through.
Fortunately for Singaporeans, setting up a local company is a straight forward process:  https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company
Networking is nice but the real meat is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that shows that people want to use your product/service. Once you have that, it makes your discussions with potential investors/vendors/customers much more compelling.0 comments4"
2,"Jackie Tan YenLevel 2. RookieAnswered 1d agoI'm gonna assume you're talking about a B2C idea. You should validate before even thinking about registering your company. A common mistake is building before you ask whether a person would pay to use it.
Bear in mind there's a big difference between someone willing to use it and someone willing to pay for it. It's important know who your first five customers are, and whether you can reach them.
As for fear of the idea getting stolen - don't worry. Ideas are cheap, execution matters more.0 comments1"
3,"Kl KohLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2d agoI think like many others who have shared here, validating the idea with an MVP should be the core of the business. To give some further insight/examples, here's a diagram of 'how' to do it:But before the MVP and plunging any limited resources into building and enhancing it, conducting user interviews to determine what features an MVP will have is important too. User interviews usually come in two stages: empathizing, and then ideating.1) Emp: the trick is to not tell the potential user what you want to build. Ask questions about his/her life in general, and fish out pain points faced in going about their everyday life.2) only when those PPs are uncovered (at least in your notes), then ask, you mentioned you have trouble with xxx, how would it be like if I can solve it? What would be a good way to do it for you? How much would you pay?And Singapore being a practical society, MVP and user interviews can all be done in your spare time, as a side hustle, means you don't have to quit your day jobs! (provided you are willing to put in an additional 30 hours a week to do this, cos being in a startup means 74-hour weeks are commonplace anyway)A few tools to help you in this process are pitchspot.co and thestartupbuddy.co0 comments1"
4,"Randy ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2w agoThere are steps/checkpoints to be ticked off before one can confidently determine if any business is good or bad. Very often you’ll be able to qualify your business ideas through these pointers:1) Product market fit?Does the product solve an existing or potential problem in the market that you're launching in? Is the market willing to adopt your product?2) Addressable market size?Is there a large enough demand that would use your product now and in the future? Will there be a large enough demand that’s willing to pay for your product?3) Strong unit of economics?Are you able to make money, or show signs/possibilities of making money as the business scales? More often than not, you would be able to collect enough data points simply by taking your minimum viable product straight to the market. 
There’s no clearer truth than what the market tells you. From there, you would either find yourself being able to secure an early-stage investment and carry your business to the next phase of testing or make the hard decision to kill your business idea.Hope this helps!0 comments1"

But just be careful of people cannibalising your idea (which is also frequent). Best to talk to a trusted person.https://seedly.sg/questions/what-are-some-good-networking-events-in-singapore-for-smes-small-businesses
