Investments is a huge topic by itself.There are various asset classes and countless mediums to invest into this asset class. If you are unsure about all of these. I will highly recommend you to understand the various kind of asset class first. (Example: cash/bonds, equities, properties, gold/commodities, insurances/wealth creation and businesses)Understand them and know how to use and allocate each of them to your portfolio and desired outcome0 comments3"

ProdigyAnswered on 22 Apr 2019TLDR: I seriously recommend that people learn more about investing (value-investing in particular) rather than purely outsourcing your financial future/security to Financial Advisors or settling for single-digit returns by buying index funds. Assuming you're youngish (0 comments0"
3,"TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi I understand how you felt as I was previously in your shoes as well.I have no idea where to start and when i was approached by FAs they only suggested ILP which I'm not very interested in. The simple reason why I'm against ILP is the lock-in period and the limited controls i have over the plans. I dont deny the fact that it actually generates quite a good return (7-10%) but I rather have more control. To answer your question: I would recommend you to do your own research and start investing yourself and not depend on FAs (I dont mean they are bad but why 'pay' FAs when you can do it yourself)Monthly RSP. One of the lower risks in investment. However it also means lesser returns.Blue chips stocks. I look for companies that are stable and gives out regular dividends (~5%)You can also consider on RoboAdvisors (instead of FA, robots are cheaper and sometimes the statistics generated from robots are better analysis)1 comment0"

5,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'm not sure you fully comprehend why you shouldn't get an ILP. There are over 13 types of regular premium ILP and some of them have even lower break even costs than some fund houses along with a range of side benefits. So if you get more benefits for a lower cost, you actually have nothing to complain about aside from a lock in period, and if you're not committing to investing long term you shouldn't invest at all. I offer iFast though, if you insist.Some people are going to advice you to read and stuff. If you wanted to read, you would have read instead of asking this question.Talk to a specialist.https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/investing-is-like-trying-to-eat-chocolate-in-the-deserthttps://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.547 comments0"
