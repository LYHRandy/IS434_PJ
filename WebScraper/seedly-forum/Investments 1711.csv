1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Apr 2019Hello! I recommend Morningstar's ""The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing"" by Pat Dorsey. This book goes through the basics of technical analysis (financial statement, valuation etc) and touches on the differences between industries. This book teaches you what to look for and although it is technically-oriented, it is easy to understand. The key takeaway would be the 5 rulesDo your homework - Understand business you are in; How does the business makes it money? How does the company operate?Find economic moats - Does the business have competitive advantages to prevent competitors from stealing its market share? Have a margin of safety - Try to buy the business at a price which is lower than what you think the business is really worthHold for the long haul - Investing for the long term is more beneficial because you pay less taxes and less fees for the transactions. In addition, he believes that the short-term price movement of the business does not necessarily reflect the real valueKnow when to sell0 comments2"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Apr 2019Hello!I would recommend the book Rich dad,poor dad by Robert Kisoyaki!The book is about the author narrating the money lessons that he has learnt from over the years from two fathers with different mindsets when it comes to money. The poor dad, the educated one made money mistakes and was stuck in a 'rat race'. While the rich dad taught him to move ahead with a bold mindset.
Here are some of the key takeaways from the book. 1) The rich don't work for the money2) Financial literacy is of great importance; ""Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone"" accorind to Robert Kisoyaki3) It is important to know the differnce between assets and liabilities. An assest is something that brings you money while a liability is something that takes money out of your pocket.4)The rich acquire assets, the poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets.0 comments2"
3,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Apr 2019I think 1 book that is preached about the most, and with good reason, is Benjamin Graham's ""the intelligent investor"", the father of value investing. Though you yourself may not be a value investor, his insights into the markets have stood the tests of time rather well, because his evaluation of the fundamental driving forces of the market prices are based something innate in us: Human Emotion. The biggest takeaway you can take away from his book is the allegory of Mr Market, or the stock prices that are displayed every day, hour, minute. His idea is this: your reason of investment should not be because of the price movement, but of the true fundamental value of the share you own - meaning the business model, the management, the products etc. Markets and prices can be irrational at times, and that is why investment decisions should not be based upon them, but rather rational analysis on a firm's business viability. Buy into what you think the firm is worth, not what other people think the firm is worth!0 comments1"
