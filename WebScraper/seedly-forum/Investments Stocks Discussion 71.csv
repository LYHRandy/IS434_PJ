question,"Investments Stocks Discussion Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Sep 2019Can someone help me with understanding how StashAway charges work?Hi all, I am a new user of StashAway and have some questions that I will like to consult everyone in this community.I have invested 1k with StashAway and understand that the charges will be annual fee + currency conversion fee + fees charged by ETF manager which means 0.8% + 0.1% + 0.2%. Hence, can I confirm that my actual returns from StashAway will be the returns reflected on their dashboard minus 1.1%?1 answerAnswerBump1"
