question,"Insurance Early Critical Illness (ECI) Asked by AnonymousAsked 2w agoI'm a male, ANB 28, non-smoker, what are my options if I'm considering a 200K ECI?Spoke to a GE agent today - was offered Supreme Early Multiplier for 50k x 4 for ECI for ~2.5K p.a., payable for 20 years, coverage for life (drops to 50k at 70y/o). Plus possibly some cash benefit + also covers 200K death/TPD, which I wanted extra 200-400K of anyway. Felt it's decent bc apparently standalone Term option for 200k ECI is already 2K p.a. (why?), payable till end of coverage (e.g. 65y/o). Thoughts? Also, what are my other options if I'm quite sure about getting 200k ECI? Thanks!3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi anon,The purpose of having a whole life plan for ECI coverage (or CI, for that matter) is so that you have a baseline coverage for a lifetime; we don't know when CI strikes, and when it does, the financial burden on you and your loved ones can be immense. CI coverage is there to provide the payout you need to cover expenses that arise not just from your ongoing expenses, but also your treatment costs not covered by your hospitalization plan (I call this the baseline). So the question you need to ask is, how much coverage do you need for your baseline, and how much you need for your daily expenses as a minimum.Having said that, Supreme Early Multiplier falls into the category of Whole Life CI/ECI plans with a multiplier, of which some of the key features you need to be aware of are:Usually level premiums, which you pay for a fixed number of years (5,10,15,20,25 years)Your coverage is for life or till 99/100 and will be increased over time by the bonuses declaredOption to boost coverage during your prime working years with a 'multiplier', in the case of your GE plan, it is a 4x multiplier boosting the baseline of 50K to 200K.This boost gives you the extra cover you need when you are young and don't have deep pockets to cover your expenses when CI strikes. When you are retired, multiplier ends (at age 70 in this case) and your baseline cover remains, boosted by the bonuses. At this point, your ongoing expenses would not depend on your ability to work, as you would get payouts from CPF, annuities, shares, UTs and the like.For plans that cover till 99/100, should you be blessed with longevity, the plan will mature and pay you the coverage amount + accumulated bonusesHas a cash value/surrender value, not that you should surrender it.However, your baseline of 50K might be too low. Although coverage of 200K after the multiplier is quite decent, when you reach 70, your coverage will drop to only 50K + bonuses. Due to the low baseline, your bonuses accumulated will be lower. You might want to consider a higher baseline, with a lower multiplier, the price difference will not be too much and you will have better coverage after 70.Yes, a standalone term for 200K ECI is probably in the region of 2K/yr, and that's just how it is, unfortunately. Although I do not know which term plan you were quoted, just note that for term plans, the key things to note are:Usually level premiums, which you pay for the whole duration of the planYour coverage is for the duration of the plan and will be a level amountOnce the plan ends, the cover stops. No claims mean no payout.That is why when covering death/TPD only, a term plan is the most cost-effective option, but once you add CI/ECI coverage, the common saying of 'buy term invest the rest' doesn't really make mathematical sense when you crunch the numbers.I would definitely advise you to consider ECI coverage. You are still young and ECI coverage is competitively priced for your age group. Furthermore, with advancing medical technology, people are often detecting CI at an earlier stage.There are a few ways to implement 200K of ECI cover, such as a 100K x2 multiplier life plan with full 100K x2 ECI cover, or even a 100K x3 multiplier life plan, with around 65K x3 ECI cover, and the remainder 35K x3 on late stage CI. This gives you 200K ECI cover with another 100K of late stage CI payout should the CI worsen. Just note that ECI is naturally more costly than CI. I usually recommend a mix of ECI and CI cover in a life plan. It is likely that one will either recover from ECI after 2-3 years, or it will probably progress to late stage (where the claim on late stage CI is made). This can strike a balance between premiums and coverage.Consult an independent advisor who carries plans from multiple insurers, and work through the numbers to get an appropriate amount of cover. Then you can get the quote for the right amount of cover and see which insurer would be the most cost-effective for you.0 comments6"

I did a tabulation for you from Singlife for the MultiCI standalone term plan. Premium is $1,384.83/y and with 15% discount now it is $1,170.10. To clarify, the Singlife multiCI plan is an ALL stage coverage which includes early CI.Premium is assuming a standard rate. It is to share with you that Early CI coverage can be significantly less than $2k/y till your age65.For further questions, speak to an independent advisor who works with multiple insurers including Singlife. A plan should suit your needs and planning strategy.

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoYes, standalone term plans that cover all stages of CI are quite expensive. Especially those that payout multiple times and have relapse benefits.An ECI benefit as a rider on a Whole of Life Policy is a great choice. This should be your base cover.The amount of coverage you should have is 5X your annual income. And I'll probably have my first 250k of cover as ECI cover, and any additional required to be late stage CI coverage.However, do shop around for similar products from other insurers. Unless due to budget constraint, I wouldn't structure the WL policy with a 4X Multiplier. I'd do only a 2X Multiplier because once the bonus coverage drops, the cash value should bring it back up and above the original cover.That means you won't go below your 200k in coverage.Speak to an Independent Financial Advisor to find out all your options or get a recommendation for the best few in the market. :)1 comment1"

A 100k Whole of Life Policy covering D/TPD/ECI for 100k X 2 (Multiplier ends at 71) would cost 2590/yr for 20 years. And you'll have 200k cover even after 71 as the projected cash value would cover the drop of 100k multiplier cover.

This is currently the cheapest for your age with the highest conditions covered across all insurers. And this product was just launched 2 weeks ago."
