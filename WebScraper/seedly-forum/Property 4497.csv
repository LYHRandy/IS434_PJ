How to differentiate between the good and bad ones.Good ones will not push products. If someone asked you to buy a huge Buddha or something? Go internet get a high res image and go bras basah and print. It will save you plenty.Fengshui is 1 off. There is no such thing as a yearly review. They just want to make recurrent income.It takes at least 2 hours to do an audit. From the external of your house area to the interior of individual rooms.When the price is too good to be true. It’s not true, you pay peanuts you get monkeys. But of course there are some overpriced monkeys which you need point 1 to 3 to confirm.And the misconception about feng shui is always about wealth, there are other factors too. Health and luck.Also to be practical, if you are a salaried worker, no matter how you do your feng shui, you are just drawing your pay every month. For wealth wise, it would work if your salary varies like sales or businesses, for salaried workers, you will just get smoother work process or get recognized better. 0 comments3"
2,"Lim Jin HanLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I think I would. I never used to believe in Feng Shui, but I've come to believe more in it this last few years. ​Although I haven't gotten my first property yet, a number of my friends have consulted with The Healing Xanadu before and gave good reviews about them. Am thinking of engaging their services when I buy my first home.​https://thehealingxanadu.com/product/feng-shui/ 1 comment2"

5,"Lee JiahuiLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 08 Oct 2018I bought hdb resale and i ownself decide on the layout and direction using a fengshui compass mobile app. Then after moving in, paid ~$500 for a site audit which took about 1 hr inside the house and including explanations. (Not sure if he was checking outside before he entered the house). The ""cures"" were basically just to paste coloured papers behind doors, place water at certain corners (i just put mineral water bottle), place $1 coins, and also a few concave mirrors to invert the tall buildings facing the windows. He just said to ownself source the paper and the mirrors and to place them altogether at the same time.Anyway if you believe then you believe. For me, i believe.0 comments1"
6,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My parents believe in feng shui and the geomancer we engage is from Way: https://www.wayfengshui.com/consultancy/services.php?Id=6The prices are all online, so it's quite transparent. Seems like there's a hierarchy of masters, the more ""masterful"" the more expensive. When my bf and i picked our flat, my mom insisted we consult them to pick a ""good"" unit. This ""selection of premise"" process involved calculating our ba zi based on our birthdates and times, to determine the directions ""beneficial"" for us. We then sent them the hdb floor plan of the project we were keen on, then they identified the units in those directions for us. So then when we pick units at HDB we can just pick from those lor. It was entirely done over email. From their website, the cost is $201.16 now though i kinda remember paying less 4 yrs back.1 comment1"

8,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 08 Oct 2018Haha this is a funny question. For our BTO, we did not get a fengshui master... but instead focused alot on the sitemap to plan out where would our unit be facing, the noise polluiton, light pollution elements that we would have to endure before applying for our unit selection.​However, I know many people actually paying between $300 to $500 to get an assessment from this guy: https://www.hausanalyst.com/pricing.html , who happens to be a expert at analysing homes and also future value of homes. Simply from floorplan and sitemaps. He can go all the way to actually help you shortlist your final 5 units for you to select based on historical data and future pricing etc.​What a business model! Crazy stuff! But no fengshui included hahaha.​Check it out: ​​​0 comments1"
9,Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 Oct 2018300 to 500 is ok for your mental wellbeing and peace of mind. Get the good ones. Just be careful not to sign up for packages or fall into the trap of engaging them repeatedly or relying on them too much for important decisions.0 comments0
