1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019Hello! The potential upside to investing in small caps helps offset the added risk of picking smaller, lesser-known companies.  However, it is still most important to find companies with strong growth potential and excellent management. Small-cap growth stocks carries rather high risks, thus i would think that such investments should make up a small portion of your overall portfolio. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
