1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Mar 2019Hey there! To analyse REITS, there are a few considerations1) LocationCMT's malls are located more centrally as opposed to FCT's. 2) OccupancyOccupancy level for FCT was approximately 90% whereas CMT's was 99.2%.2) Dividend Yield-- The main aim of purchasing a REIT. If we were to look at both counters, CMT dividend yield of 4.81%FCT dividend yield of 5.17% Consistency-wise, one can observe that FCT is said to be more consistent in terms of it's dividend payouts. For the past 5 years, its DPS has either remained constant or increased, whereas CMT's dividend fluctuate on a wider variance over the same period of time. 3) Gearing / Leverage / DebtThis is important when assessing a REIT as REITS are majority formed up by debt which will largely affect Net Income after paying off loan interests. CMT is made up of 35.4% liabilitiesFCT is made up of 31.8% liabilitiesHence any increase in interest rate is of significant impact towards CMT than FCT. Nonetheless, FCT is at its 52 week high whereas CMT is approximately 3% from it's 52 week high. This is not a buy/sell call so please do your additional research should you choose to make an action.​​​0 comments2"
