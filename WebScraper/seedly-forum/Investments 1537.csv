1,"TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Simply because bank interests are too low to counter inflation.  CIMB fastsaver 1% (no conditions) or even DBS Multiplier or UOB (~2% with conditions to be met) is not enough.I started with RSP with POSB Invest Saver which buys ETFs monthly. Using DCA method its easier to enter the market earlier cus you dont really need to time the market. I set the monthly amount to roughly 30% of my savings. For the remaining of my savings I'll spilt half (35%) into CIMB Fastsaver (1%) and another 35% into stocks. But before that, I had a sum of 'emergency funds' put into SSB (~2% returns P.A without conditions). As the name suggest, its for emergency so i dont expect myself to take it out anytime soon thus i feel that its quite safe and stable to put in SSB (it can be taken out within 1 month of notice without penalty)0 comments2"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019For me, it was when I realised that whenever I wanted to buy anything I liked to pursue my hobby (gaming, floorball) I had to work part- time to earn money for it. So when I got really tired of doing that I realised that a much better way was to start saving little by little instead of just spending everything and working when I needed more. But saving was proving too slow, so I thought"" what makes money grow faster?"" and then started to go research alittle bit more about investing everyday. First was with SSBs (since it's really as good as riskless) then came the ETFs, then finally I do a few stock picks, some winning, some losing. I think it all starts from the idea that you want money to grow without needed to physically put in the hours to work for it. Once you understand the importance and the efficiency of money working for you instead of you purely working for it, I think it will come quite naturally as well and help you overcome your inertia. Don't worry about losing a little bit of money, start small first, and work your way up from there!0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019I got started because I saw that banks give meagre interest, and I knew that I got to compound my money when I am young to take advantage of compounding.I did a lot of research and reading up before eventually mustering up the courage to invest, along with a few of my friends. I guess discussing the topic with friends and agreeing to invest in a certain stock together helped me to get over the inertia :)0 comments0"
