question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Aug 2019Will joining the banking industry always be good in career prospect?Hi, I am currently working in the IT industry. Banks have been increasing their manpower aggressively during this period. I wondered if joining the banking industry would be a good career for non-banking roles (IT and other roles) in the long run. Considering that banks would generally offer a higher salary compared to employers in other sectors, it may seem attractive to jump ship. What are your opinions?1 answerAnswerBump2"
