question,"AMA Investment Moats Investments Asked by Ronald SzieAsked on 26 Jul 2018Interested to hear your thoughts on the LionGlobal All Seasons Fund. Anything I should look out for before committing to an investment in a Unit Trust?I am looking into the fund (Hard to miss their ads at Raffles Place MRT). It has a few good selling points on lower management fees and a wide spread of funds (in their FAQ https://www.lgidirect.com.sg/allseasonsfund/faq/ they are invested in a bucket of ETFs with US, Europe, China and Japan funds on the equity side, and bonds funds in the fixed income side). Probably looking at the investment fund (70% equity, 30& fixed income) and putting it for 3 to 5 years.1 answerAnswerBump1"
