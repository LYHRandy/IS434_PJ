2,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi!The idea of using POSB Invest Saver (a form of Regular Share Savings Plan) which utilises the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging helps to accommodate to the dips in the market by purchasing a larger amount of STI ETF and when the reverse comes, it'll purchase less. Henceforth, this is a long-term tool that helps you tide by the volatility of the market. Furthermore, given how you're invested in STI ETF - which itself is considered less risky / volatile as compared to individual stocks, I think you're in safe hands and will recommend you to hold it for long as what others have mentioned too1 comment0"

There is no guarantee that stock prices will go up; if you always sell when the stock prices are down, you will always be making a loss. If you trust in the companies (or, in this case, the STI ETF) you invest in, then you shouldn't sell just because they are down. You should only sell when you don't think the fundamentals hold anymore.0 comments0"

Meaning when it drops, your monthly sum is able to buy more of the STI ETF, and vice versa when it rises.Overall, over a longer holding period, your unit cost will be lower and you will make some capital gains + dividends over the years.0 comments0"
