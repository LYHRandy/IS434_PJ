If you are in a relatively new estate and high market price (ie $600k and above), you can move to less prime area for a more affordable HDB and profit the difference. ​It is also possible to sell your HDB and upgrade to a condo as well. ​Whether you should move to a HDB unit further away from the city centre or upgrade to a condo really depends on your goal in real estate. ​If you want to be have more liquid cash on hand and don’t mind the distance to the city, moving outwards is a good idea. ​Hope I have answered your question! :)0 comments0"
