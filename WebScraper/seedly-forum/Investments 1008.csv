question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Jun 2019Is it atypical of me to not have a personal financial advisor?For me, I DIY my personal finance matters and I would think that's sufficient for me (earnings > spendings, optimize credit card, term insured, cpf top up, investments, personal excel sheet w annual milestones check in). But I also realize that i dont know what I dont know, and am considering to get a FA. How do you meet your FAs and how was your experience so far? This question is directed to non financial advisors.2 answersAnswerBump1"

MasterUpdated on 11 Jun 2019The purpose of financial advisors is to guide you and give you financial advises tailored to your needs.This can be particularly useful for those who are overwhelmed by the insurance choices or not knowing where/how/what to start investing.Nowadays, there's many comparison websites and community sharing platforms which gives honest feedbacks and advices which may replace human financial advisors (of which some usually hard sell).Personally, I would read up a lot from various sources online compare the information and then make a judgement. If there's still something that stumbles me, I would ask the community for their unbiased views!2 comments6"

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Jun 2019I personally don't have an FA.I find that DIY-ing my personal finance matters on a spreadsheet, and doing my own research, has been sufficient for me thus far. Additionally, with the ease of being able to find information online, it makes it even easier to get the answers you need. Crowdsourcing platforms like Quora and Seedly also help to make it easier. With an FA, given the fact that ultimately it's their job, you will need to weigh the fees you are paying vs the benefit you get. If you are dealing with large sums of money then perhaps it might make sense. But with relatively small sums, I don't think its necessary.0 comments1"
