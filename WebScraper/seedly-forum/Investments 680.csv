God of WisdomUpdated on 20 Aug 2019I would not recommend buying into REITs ETF as the transaction costs are rather high relative to the amount you are investing. As a guideline, try to keep transactions cost low (< 0.5%) of your investment amount to achieve economies of scale. You can consider DCA on UTs as there are no transaction costs and your monthly budget is $300/mth.3 comments5"

May I know if I can consider etf like STI index?Elijah Lee20 Aug 2019Hi, I would suggest focusing on just one asset class first, probably UTs for a start. $300/mth as I mentioned would incur relatively high costs. For index like STI, frankly I feel that S&P 500 or DJIA would be a better option as an index. The STI hasn't really had fantastic returns compared to the broader market. You'd want to start on ETFs as a lump sum when markets are down, due to costs."
