WizardAnswered on 23 Sep 2018To me, success is able to persist all the way and achieve what you set out to do, be it financially, career or even relationship with family, children, love one.  ​That is in essence, Succes to me :) ​Hope you find your success, if you haven't, it might be worth re-thinking your definition of it because many times , we may already have success (hence happiness) in the things that we have pursued but it's just that we're looking at it with a wrong view/definition! :)0 comments0"

Or you might consider success to be having a mansion to live in, with cars that people dream of buying. It all depends on you!0 comments0"
5,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Everyone measures success differently. To some, being financially strong or holding a managerial position is considered successful while for others, it may just be earning a decent income but spending most of their free time with their loved ones instead of being occupied with work. To me, I admire people who come from a humble background and become successful in executing an idea of their own, i.e. Founders of startups. 0 comments0"
