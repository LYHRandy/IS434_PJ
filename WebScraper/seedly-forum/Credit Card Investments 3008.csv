question,"Credit Card Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Nov 2018How to stop debit transactions?How can I stop a pending debit transaction? I deposited funds into an online trading account with an OCBC debit card, but I now suspect that itâ€™s a scam company (arotrade.com) and I want to withdraw my funds. Arotrade.com states that in order to withdraw now, I need to verify my account by providing a copy of my IC, my billing address and a photo of both sides of my debit card used to make this transaction. I have not done so. OCBC claims they can only stop it it Arotrade allows it.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It may not be a scam company. Providing ID is a standard procedure. You'll need to do that for any other trading accounts. This is part of anti money laudering. The only possible way is to file a chargeback on the transaction with ocbc on the reason of fraud.2 comments0
2,"Lok Yang Teng27 Nov 2018Edit: Haha I disagree with that...it has got quite some negative reviews on Playstore about being fraudulent in nature and the incessant harping on being truthful (""a strong reputation for financial competence, integrity and honesty"") is questionable. While the company is based in Ceentral America supposedly, the transactions goes through Bulgaria. The code ifsc/60/391/TS/18 is not registered at all. You can check out their website!Yixiong Chang27 Nov 2018Yea, I understand. The regulator is Belize in central america. I think it wasnt mentioned they are based in US, just the regulator and transaction are processed in Bulgaria. I'm just saying that anywhere else your trading account will need ID verification as well. Credit card fraud is also common, so the financial institution will need to verify the card is yours before they refund money back to u. =D
Unfortunately OP already decided to deposit money, could be some factors that drew him to do that. Why not just continue to trade, if u lose all the money then ther... (more)"

If they are unable to do so then it'll be an expensive lesson learnt. I'm not sure if the Police works here since you signed on willingly instead of them forcing you to join.0 comments0"
