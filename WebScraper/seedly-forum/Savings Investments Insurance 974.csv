1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 04 Jul 2019If I had a time sensitive specific goal that required a sum of money without any exceptions, a savings plan would serve my purpose as there is a guarantee, with upside potential. E.g. children's education. I can't tell my kid that he/she has to delay university for a year or two because the stocks that I bought are down by 50% in a market crash and that I have to wait for the market to recover before selling them to cash out.As for investments, I prefer to invest on my own terms. Setting up RSP into UTs is easy, and I prefer to buy stocks when I find a price point I like. Hence to invest, I would not need to do it via an ILP.1 comment10"
2,"SKStacy Kuah04 Jul 2019Totally agree with this point, for me ILP doesn’t seems to serve me well in Long term, whereby there are high sales charge for the agent and as well as Fund managers performance accounted for. In the Long term, I will not benefit as much and may even lost my principal amount.

 It’s arguable that ILP could serve as “investment” and “insurance” at the same time. But I feel insurance and Investment are totally different serve different purpose. That’s my 5cents worth, other may think differently."

God of WisdomAnswered on 19 Jun 2019Great question!I'll definitely purchase annuities as they are one of the only ways to get a guaranteed stream of income for life. I wouldn't purchase an endowment policy for 'General savings'. There are better ways to achieve that.I'd also purchase single premiums ILPs to access certain funds that I'd like to include in my portfolio, you usually pay a one time fee and that's it. Regular ILPs cost a little too much for me and I don't necessarily need the forced contribution or lock in.0 comments3"
4,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 20 Jun 2019I would almost never recommend an ILP but it depends on why and what you are saving for.If its very specific and you want the money at a fixed point in time, dont count on the ilp where the value is determined by the prices then.Eg argument of using ILP as insurance death coverage. If touch wood choy, you die when the trade war is at its peak, or whatever doom and gloom, the payout is when prices are quite depressed. How?Substitute death with children going university. Are you going to tell the kids, erm market not good, 20% less than what I hoped for, can you delay your studies by xx years until the recession is over and prices are peaking again?There's always an uncertainty on how much you could cash out.But if this was for retirement income from 65 till 87, the timing is less of an issue, though the insurance cost charges start ramping up and eating into the values.For retirement, I came to my conclusion you first max cpf sa top up, then do the srs till max of 15.3k per year, and if you still have leftover, you could start looking at some of these alternatives.There are some savings plans or ilps that could be invested with srs though. So that's another angle to look at it.That's my thoughts.0 comments1"
