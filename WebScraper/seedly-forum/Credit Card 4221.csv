question,"Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Feb 2019I never considered that businesses pay fees when I use nets/credit card payment. Does it bother any of you that small businesses are affected by the charges?It was never salient to me that small businesses didn't like nets/credit card payment because there is an associated charge to it. I just wanted to maximize expenditure on my credit card because of the rebates etc, plus it is so convenient. Now I kinda feel bad thinking back on occasions when I paid at tiny businesses with not much profit with credit card. I mean, how much rebates am I clocking vs how much is their project margin affected...? Has anyone considered this, and how do you decide?2 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 12 Feb 2019i think most businesses will include the charges into their price so if you pay by cash you are technically paying more for other people paying nets/credit card. If you pay cash at Sim Lim for computer parts, some stores would even give you discounts which means they alr included charges into pricing. So dont have to feel really bad about it since you are the one paying for the fees. 0 comments0"
