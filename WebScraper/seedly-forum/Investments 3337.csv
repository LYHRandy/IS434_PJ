It's not an SGX listed stock.â€‹You have to get that China basically manufactures them and the primary market is in the US, so keep an eye out when you're trading because it's not so simple. No one else has the spending power + land in a frivolous manner. So consider US stocks with said drone companies. 0 comments0"
