1,"Arron TanLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 21 Feb 2019I would personally suggest for the ladies to go with the DBS Woman’s World Mastercard. This card caters to not only travel enthusiasts but also to ladies who indulge in their obligatory shopping sessions from time to time. However, I would say that the Citi Rewards card would come in a close second. As the name suggests, the Citi Rewards card offers rewards to just about anything. PROSWith this card, you can earn an impressive 10X points whenever you shop for clothes, bags, and shoes. This applies to not only online (fashion retailers) or in departmental stores – but also both locally and overseas as well. That literally means that, for every single dollar you spend, you will get 10 reward points, which also translates to 4 miles. With a shelf life of 5 years, these accumulated points can also be exchanged for flights, accommodations, gadgets, and more. Amongst other perks, this card also gives you 50% discounts with some popular online platforms such as Lazada, and Zalora. Rest assured, this card has got you shopaholics covered.CONSThere is a maximum cap of 120,000 points for 5 years (if you even consider that a “con”), and that personally; I think the annual fee of $193 is pretty high, but that’s about it.OVERALLI guess at the end of the day, it’s how you define the line in between good and bad. If you are earning enough to support a lifestyle worth of frequent shopping and traveling, then this card should be one worth considering. Hope I helped!0 comments0"
