1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 22 May 2019Great work for that 30k savings.Before you go off investing, set aside money for emergency fund (6 months of expenses, use 6 months of income once you start working)If there is any money you will need in 3 years, donâ€™t invest that too. You can put those in a fixed deposit.You can use the remaining money to set up a well diversified portfolio according to your desired outcome across the 6 major asset classes. 
Or you can go for some courses. (Courses are good investment for beginners because it kick start your learning) All the best!0 comments4"

There are several options to go it alone and do DIY or try out various online and offline platforms. Some great books to get you going.

Please also take a look at this article I wrote. https://endowus.com/insights/true-giants-of-the-investment-world-buffett-templeton-booth-bogle-swensen-5eaf2babf6/I would ask you to try out Endowus, the most sophisticated wholly digital independent financial advisor in Singapore.

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 16 May 2019Kudos to having $30k of savings as a student!First of all, set aside a portion that you would seem as emergency funds. I am also assuming that your university fees are fully accounted for already, since that is a significant expense. With the remaining funds, I would then look to invest in it. You could do it the hands-on way with robo-advisors, or try your own hand at equity investments, which also require a relatively lower capital size. Later on when you have amassed a larger sum, you might want to look at other asset classes like property etc. That's what I did!0 comments3"
4,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Jiaqi! Preserving Current CapitalAside from what Hariz and Grabriel suggested, another investment vehicles commonly utilised by beginners would be RSP - Regular Savings Plan. You simply pay a fixed amount every month (min. $100) to invest in ETFs or Indexes. This practice is good as it utilises the theory of Dollar-Cost Averaging, allowing one to diligently invest in the markets every month regardless of the price of the fund. You can get started through the 3 local banks in Singapore and brokers as well.Lump-sum investingHowever, if you prefer putting in a one-time investment kindda strategy, you could find stocks that are recession-proof i.e. consumer discretionary / monopolistic stocks such as the likes of Sheng Siong. Granted the price does not fluctuate much but at the very least you can be 80% assured that you capital would still be somewhat there as oppsoed to other industries. REITs also provide a good source of recurring income. I've invested in REITs for 7 years now and the dividends alone have almost covered my capital vested into the company. Hope it helps!2 comments2"
5,"Kelvin Tan21 May 2019Billy, what is the average return of investment for REITS?Billy Ko21 May 2019Hi Kelvin. Dividend yields can range from 5% - 9%. Depending on the outlook of the REITs, it can provide a substantial sum of capital appreciation (or depreciation) but my personal advice is that if you don't require the money, its a good source of passive income. 5 years into a REIT, my dividends alone have covered 45% of my cost. Adding in the capital gains, It's close to 70% of my cost being covered."

WizardAnswered on 16 May 2019You can DIY invest or try out a roboadvisor.If not you can play it safe first and put into Singapore savings bonds, fixed deposits.I suppose as a student, you might have plans in future for BTO, wedding or other huge expenses. You can park the cash in Singapore saving bonds if these are an upcoming expense.0 comments2"

8,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 22 May 2019A few things to set things in place. Financial planning can be divided into 2 segment.DefendAttack Ensure that your portfolio is well covered by hospital plan and a decent life/term that covers early critical illness. This is your defense.Once set up, use the rest of your funds that are not your emergency funds to invest. Of course there are multiple invesments that you can go into. ROBO, ETF, FUNDS, STOCKS, BONDS. There are multiple selections. You can either read up on your own and start learning about them or get a professional to guide you through. Of course if you would like to learn more, message me back and I would be glad to share more.0 comments1"
9,Benn NgLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 May 2019Open a brokerage account and read up on how to invest. Plan what ur portfolio should look like. Read up on asset allocation and portfolio construction like 7 twelve.  Then allocate with no more than 5% in any asset. Stay invested and rebalance once in a while. Make use of ETFs. Treat ur funds as if its temasek and make decisions as if u are the boss. Good luck.0 comments1
