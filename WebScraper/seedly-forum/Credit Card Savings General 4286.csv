WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For redmart, use CTB (Citibank credit card) for 8% rebates and 5% for other cards and min $40 order can get free delivery 365 days a year morning till night, so very flexible and good. Live up credit quite worth it (I compare it as Fairprice points redeem) but has short expiry date ( to get people spend fast !)Lazada must find deals then worth it. The taoabo collection within not good , more expensive than buying direct from taobao.Netflix is nice and worth it. Steaming quality is good, only downside is limited new TV show2 comments1"
