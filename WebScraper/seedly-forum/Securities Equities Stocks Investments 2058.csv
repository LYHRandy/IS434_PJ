1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Mar 2019Definitely a positive for Disney to me. Disney pretty much solidified its stake in the market, setting itself up against Netflix and Amazon in the streaming service market. Let me cover some of the key news so far.""Disney has said all along that it intends, due to the merger, to save $2 billion annually by 2021, and such rhetoric usually means jobs will be lost. ""This is what happens in mergers,"" explains Northlake Capital Management founder Steven Birenberg. ""It's partially the point, as cost savings boost the financials.""Now Layoffs- this is probably inevitable, but still hurts from a PR/ethical pov. After all these are the same talent that brought studio successes to both Disney and Fox studios. I am going to come out and make a prediction- if I was Netflix or Amazon- who are both obsessed about content generation, this would be opportune time to make hires. With massive experienced individuals in the scene, I would not be surprised if most of them go over. In short, small win for Netflix & Amazon here.One of the biggest surprises Thursday was that Disney said it would shutter Fox 2000, the label famous for midbudget films like The Devil Wears Prada and Hidden Figures.To me this is simply a management decision, and while this might be justified from a operational/financial efficiency standpoint, this is seems extremely unpopular with Creatives in the film industry. Because I believe it the Creatives whom drive the film industry forward, again, image wise this does not bode well for talent recruitment for Disney now and in the future.0 comments1"
