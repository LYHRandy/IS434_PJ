Some popular metrics are P/E ratio, P/B ratio, D/E ratio and PEG ratio. The P/E ratio is what the market is willing to pay today based on the stock's past and future expected earnings. A high P/E ratio means a stock is overvalued. The PEG ratio is derived from the P/E ratio. The PEG provides a more complete picture as it takes into account the company's earnings today and its forecasted growth rate. This forward-looking perspective is important for value investors. The P/B ratio is what investors are willing to pay for each dollar of a company's asset. This ratio is important to value investors because it shows the difference between the market value of a company's stock and its book value. Value investors tend to look for companies with P/B ratio of 0.5 or P/B ratios < 1, because this means market value is one half of the company's stated book value.D/E ratio shows the proportion of debt to equity a company is using to finance its asset. A low D/E ratio means the company uses a lower amount of debt for financing.0 comments1"
