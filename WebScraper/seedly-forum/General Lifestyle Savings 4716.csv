1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 10 Aug 2019Depends on how you look at it.
Financially wise, its almost never worth it to own a car, since its an depreciating asset.But if a car brings value to your work, relationships, etc
Then I think its worth it to have one if you are financially able to afford it.To a taxi driver, his/her car is an income generating asset. And depending on your profession, a car might help you to be more efficient.A parent with a car might find it valuable as they fetch their child to and fro school; giving them time to communicate and learn more about what their child is going through (having a good relationship with your loved ones will always be priceless).So it really depends on why you want the car and what impact will it bring along.1 comment6"

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 31 May 2019If it's for keeping up with the Joneses, absolutely not, because a car is a depreciating asset from a financial p.o.v.If the argument for having a car is convenience, it depends on your daily commute. For example, my home is near to the MRT Station, and I find that 90% of the time I get to my destination faster on train instead of via car. Also, think about the traffic jams during peak hour.
If however, it is a way for you to generate income or makes you more efficient, then it's worth considering. Again, all car types bring you from destination A to B. Not worth getting a flashy car unless you have money to throw, but get one that is reliable and does not cos trouble in terms of repairs and maintenance.0 comments4"

WizardAnswered on 31 May 2019If you got a few kids to ferry around a car will be useful.Also, if you need to get around for sales or do business, then it helps because your time is literally money.But for regular office workers, a car is a drain on resources.0 comments3"
5,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 08 Aug 2019Hi there anon,Agreed with what Clarence shared! If having a car value adds to your lifestyle (work, family, friends, hobbies .etc) and if it outweighs the high costs incurred in it (getting your license, COE, car's cost, maintenance, petrol .etc), then I think you should get it. I think both public transport and driving your own car have their own perks. I personally wouldn't get a car because I am relatively satisfied with our public transport (compared to some other countries) and other transport alternatives like Grab & Gojek.If you're looking for more information & analysis, here are some helpful Seedly articles about driving in Singapore!How much should you be earning before buying a car in SG: https://blog.seedly.sg/buy-car-how-much-should-be-earning/Cost of getting a car in SG 2019: https://blog.seedly.sg/factors-cost-car-price-singapore/Driver's license costs in SG: https://blog.seedly.sg/cost-driving-license-singapore-private-vs-school/Petrol price comparison in SG: https://blog.seedly.sg/ultimate-comparison-petrol-station-prices-best-credit-card-fuel-promotions-singapore-sinopec-shell-esso-caltex-spc/Other 'Transportation' articles on Seedly: https://blog.seedly.sg/category/financial-lifestyle/transportation/Hope they help!! :-)2 comments3"
6,"Samuel Chin07 Aug 2019One tip that I always adopt in purchasing things is on: mileage. Meaning how often am I going to use it, because that determines its value. 

Take for example a $100 vs $1000 bag,
If I really like the $1000 bag I use it everyday vs $100 only once a month - yes it‚Äôs cheaper but it has lower value.

7,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 08 Aug 2019Yes and no, though mostly no.  This is a question you have to truthfully answer to yourself.
Having a car usually have the main benefit of being able to go wherever you want, anytime you want without being at the mercy of someone else, e.g. Bus, Taxi.
The cons of having a car is that it adds to your monthly expenses, with all the things such as petrol, insurance, road tax,  repairs, inspections, etc.
Now, as to whether it is worthwhile depends on what do you do with the car. The most common reason for having a car is ‚Äúmy job needs it.‚Äú This depends on a few things, such as whether your salary is a fixed salary, or variable one, does your client need to see you in a certain perspective, or are you buying the car to lease out (something like ride-sharing)? The first two points mentioned are more intangible, but can still be verified. Compared to you before owning a car, are you making more money, after paying for the car? Is the increased income consistent, sustainable?0 comments0"
