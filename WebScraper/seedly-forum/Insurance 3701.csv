God of WisdomAnswered on 21 Aug 2019Hey Anon, the Ministry of Health has done some comparisons on their website for the different integrated shield plans available.But if I may, I'd suggest speaking to an Independent Financial Advisor who can provide you with a comparison from multiple insurers.There are quite a few, albeit slight, differences between each insurer's options with some additional benefits that others may not have, such as an extra million dollars to seek medical advice in another country, or discounted GP prices with their medical network, or a cheaper premium if you only choose to use a particular hospital.If you'd like to explore this, you can drop me a message on Facebook.0 comments2"
