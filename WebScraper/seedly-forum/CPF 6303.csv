And whenever there are significant changes to your life. If u do not nominate, your CPF monies will be distributed according to the Intestate Succession Act. On top of that, there will be a fee for the amount of monies managed by the public trustee. It is about $1.9k+ for first $250, (the rate is lower the higher amount). This process will also take much longer, many months. So if u want the monies to go to only your intended person/persons, hassle-free. Make the nomination. Note that your Will does not provide for CPF monies. You should make a Will too since u are concerned. This is a topic about legacy planning.   Do add me on facebook if u would like to learn more. 0 comments0"
