question,"DBS Multiplier DBS Fresh Graduates Savings Bank Account Credit Card General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Oct 2018I'm a fresh graduate with $1950 take-home salary. I'm interested in applying for DBS Multiplier, but any advice on what credit card I should apply for?Hi guys. I'd like to sign up for DBS Multiplier, and I currently have a POSB Passbook Savings account and Debit Card. For their ""credit card spend"" transaction category, 1) Are transactions via my POSB Savings account / Debit Card counted? 2) If they aren't and I have to own a Credit Card, which card would you recommend given my low income level? Ideally with low annual fees / min spend.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Oct 2018I think all of the credit cards offered by DBS/POSB requires a minimum income of $30,000 per annum. Maybe you can consider the CIMB AWSM Credit Card. It has no annual fees and gives you 1% cashback on Dining & Entertainment, Telecommunications (Starhub/M1/Singtel/Circles.Life) and Online Shopping. If you sign up before 31 December, you can get a free Wave House Sentosa 1 hour FlowRider (worth S$40) and $30 credit if you spend at least $100 within 2 months from the date of your card activation.
