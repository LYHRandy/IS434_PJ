Best to call them directly ASAP and ask about it. ​​Can I Appeal to Waive PenaltiesGenerally, penalties will not be waived unless there are exceptional circumstances such as :This is your first time paying tax or that you have been paying on time in the past, orYou have valid reasons for paying late and you are able to substantiate these reasons with documentary evidence.The following are not considered valid reasons:Too busy with work or business, so forgot about paying tax, orFrequently travelling overseas, thus unable to check notices sent by IRAS, orNotice and Bills are not received.    Please call us on +65 6351 2833 or email us at enfmisctax@iras.gov.sg to appeal for waiver.0 comments0"
