question,"Career Lifestyle Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 May 2019I am contemplating whether to do a full time-job and part-time Insurance or just fully concentrate on full-time insurance?Hi Everyone. I am expecting a BTO in mid 2022, have a list of debts (13k in total including 7k education loan which I will be paying 250/month for the next 3-4 years). And I do not have any form of liquid savings at all. I was in the insurance industry during my university days. But now that I have recently graduated, I am thinking what should I do in my circumstances. Partly, because I feel that Insurance is doable and I want to overtake my peers. Any advice is appreciated!4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 31 May 2019The beauty about the insurance industry is when you give your 101% and focus on value adding your client, you will see the rewards.Write down what you wish to achieve in the next 3 years with action steps. Look at those 3 years and decide which path to take and then give it your all. Work harder and smarter than everyone you meet, ask the best advisors for tips, combine them, tweak it and make it work for you. Constantly review on how you can improve yourself and reflect on what else can be done. This way, I am sure you can grow leaps and bounds.If you decide to do insurance, I think you need to have the mindset of “Do or Die” don’t be half-hearted in anything you do. All the best!0 comments1"

If you are confident in your pitching skills, your caring for your customer and see it as a career, go for it.
Unlike others, I will say go totally in or just move on to other careers. Sincere and committed agents are preferred. In today's age with AI and other information, agents need to up their ball game rather than just customer sign and earning the comm.
Conclusion, if you like it, enjoy it, able to see it as a lifelong career within the sector, go for it.0 comments0"
3,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 31 May 2019It would depend on how you performed as an advisor while in Uni. If you're really confident, it is a financially rewarding career as you may already know.But please don't just do it for the money. Give good advice, and positively affect your clients' lives. Try it out full time for a year again while still allowing yourself time to do some side hustles to add extra income and possibly meet new prospects. If it doesn't work out, reflect and readjust. It may or may not be for you.0 comments0"
