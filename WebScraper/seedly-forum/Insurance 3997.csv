question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Nov 2018Should I keep my WL policy bought by my parents when I was young?I'm a 23-year-old female who just started working. I have existing WL, medical and personal accident policies bought by my parents when I was young. I intend to keep the medical and personal accident but I'm uncertain if I should keep the WL. The annual premium for the WL is $547 for 50k coverage. Should I keep this policy and top up with a term insurance? Or should I surrender and buy a term insurance instead? On top of this dilemma, I'm also keen on getting a critical illness insurance.5 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Nov 2018You might want to do a comparison table on the Whole Life you have bought. With that, it is easier to make a deicsion.You can plot the premiums (right from year 1) and compare it with Buy Term, Invest Rest (with CPF-SA or CPF-OA as a benchmark), to find the best time to surrender, withdraw, or maybe just to keep the WL cover.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 28 Nov 2018Hey Anon, I suggest you take a look at your premium end date and also the current surrender value of the policy.Even if you're not using it for its death benefit, it's still an asset that has a solid 3-4% return per annum.So I would advise against cancelling it. But you should top up your insurance coverage. The rule of thumb is to have about 10 X of your annual income as death coverage and 4-5X as CI coverage. 0 comments0"
4,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 Nov 2018Whether to surrender the WL aside, I feel u should still get a Term insurance. Your current coverage is grossly inadequent. For your age, u can get a $400K (death, TPD, and CI) sum assured till age 65, for less than $700 annual premium. What is this medical and personal policies that u have. It should be reviewed and compared with newer polices as well. Newer Personal accident policies could have better terms and coverage. once u have gotten your coverage in place, then u can decide whether to keep the WL. Personally I feel the premium can be better utilitized elsewhere. There are better alternatives to do what the WL would be intended to accomplish. Do add me on facebook if u require further detailed discussion. I can only provide a short summary here.0 comments0"
5,"Alan KorLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 28 Nov 2018 The annual premium for the WL is $547 for 50k coverage Do you have any dependents? If yes, do you think the 50k death or total disability payout is sufficient to tide your dependents till they become independent?Use insurance for insurance purposes, dont mix insurance with investment.You will only end up:1) Paying more premiums2) Become under-insured0 comments0"
