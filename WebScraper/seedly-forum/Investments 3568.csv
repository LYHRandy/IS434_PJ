1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Jun 2018I personally read Rich Dad, Poor Dad :) And realised that there were two ways to build wealth.​Learn to invest (and make money work for you)Start a business​In my army days, I did 1) for awhile and asked my brother to buy local stocks for me but got burnt. Hence I went to learn to start a business, soon after, the startup wave started catching fire and thereafter, I went on that path instead :)​Other people would recommend these familiar books:A Random Walk Down Wall StreetOne Up On Wall StreetThe Intelligent InvestorBerkshire Hathaway Letters to ShareholdersThe Little Books Of Common Sense Investing​For me, after the advent of the internet and the mobile wave, I would recommend the following:​Listening to podcasts instead about business and how the economy works Reading content on personal finance websites or bloggers to figure out how they started growingThis is espeically important because it usually would be more localised :)​Or hey, you can check out Lorna Tan's book on retiring smart - that one is more on the whole wealth creation process and retirement planning phase!0 comments1"
2,"Terence AngLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 14 Jun 2018My favourite on the list would be:Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert KiyosakiThink and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill (A lot of different takes and rewrites from various people)​The books that I've yet to read but would recommend too because of my mentor: Secrets of the millionaire mind by T Harv. Eker and Money Master the game by Tony Robbins.​PS. I listen to Brendon Burchard a lot for the PD stuff and not so investment related, and it may help you perform better with your life and ultimately your investments as well.0 comments0"
