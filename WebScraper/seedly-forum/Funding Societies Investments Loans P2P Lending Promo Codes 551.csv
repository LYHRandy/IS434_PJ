1,Yingying LiLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey there! This is Yingying from Funding Societies. Unfortunately we have regulatory constraints to openly share referral codes :(Do still sign up with Funding Societies though! We have promotions which are exclusive to our investors on a regular basis.4 comments2
