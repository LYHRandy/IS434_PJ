Assume you invest 12k/yr @ 6% return.20yr old to 30 years old. 120k invested. Return @ 6% would be $158,169.50.You stop investing additional money and let it roll for another 30 years.$158,169.50 @ 6% after 30 years would be $908,445.30.Now the same 12k/yr @ 6% return for 30 years. 360k invested.Return would be $948,698.20.You'd have returned almost the same amount of money but in the latter case, invested 3 X your capital.
You can simply use the TVM formula to calculate this.1 comment4"
