1,"Nicholas Tan Yi DaLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would suggest you not to buy the galaxy fold, much less the huawei mate x. There are design flaws with these products that are already floating online with early test units. As these are the first gen flexible display phones by the companies, the technology is still not perfected and overly expensive. I rather wait for them to polish up and see how it goes. Hope thats answers ur qns.2 comments0"
