WonderkidAnswered on 01 Aug 2019P2P in Singapore, while better regulated, still has its fair share of risks.You should probably look into other stocks, REITS, ETC before P2P if your goal is diversification.If you have done all that and still would like to try P2P but are unsure, then probably start with what you're willing to lose to test the waters and see how that goes.0 comments1"

Unless you're lucky, read their T&C before investing. Know how they conduct checks / requirements for people who are looking for loan or how they use your money to make more money.0 comments1"
