GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018Hi Great Question. ​I am not sure what numbers you are refering to but see if this is correct:know the rough valuation of the asset versus the current price. this enables me to know whether fundamentally the stock is sound or unsoundi am a dividend yield whore, so I require some form of compensation for waiting for some story to take place. The amount of dividend yield depends. If its a good growth company I can take 3-4% dividend if the growth is 7%, that adds up to 10%. For those zero growth stocks, i prefer a 10% dividend yield. Usually what i look for is a 5-6% yield with a 3% growthtabulate a series of the company's cash flow, earnings. Then appreciate its sturdiness, or lack of sturdiness. It tells me a lot whether i should sleep with the owner of this stock.0 comments0"
