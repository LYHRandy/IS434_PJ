2,"Kevin Vincent27 Apr 2019I agree. Retirement savings not to be gambled . I find Non bank short term lending on First Mortgage with low LVRs at around 8-10% attractive. With 20% in Bank Term Deposits. But would love to buy into REITs and Index Funds after a crash. Trouble is when is this next one due, seeing there was always one after 7-10 years of bull markets. This current one is now the second longest running bull market.Ang Yee Gary28 Apr 2019Crash is coming soon

God of WisdomAnswered on 27 Apr 2019Retirees shouldn't have a lot of exposure to equity markets. Probably only 20%-30% of your net worth.If you still want your net worth to adjust for inflation, buy short term bonds, money market funds, and guaranteed products.You should look at guaranteed streams of income right now, make sure that you don't outlive your money.0 comments0"
