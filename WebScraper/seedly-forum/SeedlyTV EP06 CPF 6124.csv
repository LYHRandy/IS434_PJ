You  can instruct CPF Board to start your Retirement Sum Scheme (RSS)  payouts anytime from your payout eligibility age.  To do so, please  submit
FORM RSS30: Apply for Monthly Payouts and Change Bank Details under CPF Retirement Sum Scheme (PDF, 1.0MB).For  members turning age 70 from 2018 onwards, if you have not started your  monthly payouts by age 70, the Board will do so automatically for you.  This automatic payout start age of 70 simplifies the activation process  for RSS members to receive payouts for retirement.
