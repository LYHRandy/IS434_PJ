1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Mar 2019Hello!You will need to know exactly what value and growth stocks mean before deciding which is better. I feel that the answer will differ for everyone so it will depend what kind of investor you are before you yourself determine which type of stock will be better for you. Here is my take on the two tyoes of stocks Value stocks are at least theoretically considered to have a lower level of risk and volatility associated with them because they are usually found among larger, more established companies. While growth stocks, seldom pay dividends and the chances of loss can be higher. However,  growth stocks that pan out are at least traditionally viewed as having the highest potential for the greatest returns over time.0 comments0"
