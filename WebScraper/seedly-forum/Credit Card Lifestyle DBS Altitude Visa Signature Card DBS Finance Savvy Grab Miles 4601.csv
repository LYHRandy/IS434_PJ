1,Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered 2w agoThe answer is yes to your main question and no to your sub-question.There is currently a promotion going on whereby you earn 4mpd by using your DBS altitude card to pay for Grab rides till 31st Dec 2019 but NOT top-up. Top up is still the normal 1.2mpd.Registation required though:  https://www.dbs.com.sg/Contact/dbs/cards/altitude-4mpd-promotion/default.page0 comments2

3,"SShanty3w agoI believe that applies only to the DBS Altitude 4 mpd promotion on daily rides?

Looked it up on WhatCard, and it seems you'll earn the standard 1.2 mpd on GrabPay top-ups too: https://www.whatcard.sg/?amount=20.0&q=grabpay"
