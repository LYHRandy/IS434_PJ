question,"Bank Account Lifestyle General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 25 Jun 2019I frequently pay for my friend's meals because I have cash float. Is there a better way to track who I have been lending it to (so that I can get my money back too)? Hi I am the 'cash guy' (read: casual loan-shark with 0% interest) in my group of friends, which makes it hard to budget or balance my accounts month to month. This also makes for terrible headache when pay by card because my expenses are inflated Does anyone have a good way to account for lending money to friends? I currently use notes on my phone with a ledger but it is damn leceh.update: I have now become a wallet. Ex: they pass me $200 and I deduct their meal spending from there.2 answersAnswerBump0"

But since you are paying for your friends' meals, why not use it to work towards your minimum card spends, or loyalty points ;)0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 27 Jun 2019All the negative stuff aside, your situation sounds like an amazing opportunity to get a lot of  credit card rewards from all the spending you are doing on behalf! I hope you are at least maximising the rewards to 'compensate' yourself for doing the hard work of tracking group spending :)To address your issues, you could try using Splitwise (http://www.splitwise.com/), have used it with my friends whenever it is necessary to split spending (e.g. group dining, holidays) and it works pretty well!0 comments0"
