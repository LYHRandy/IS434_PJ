1,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Apart from those that listed by Gabriel, there is also dollarDEX which is said to be of $0 Sale Charges, Switching Fees And Platform Fees.  However, they do earn a portion of the annual management fee which is already embedded to the cost of the unit trust / fund.

2,"Luke Ho02 Jan 2019I've actually researched dollardex. Competitive, certainly - but they don't look profitable. It's not likely they'll stay this cheap forever. "
3,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Aug 2018I personally prefer FSM as i find their rates very competitive.​Their improved web interface makes the user experience better and they are rather upfront on their cost.​Besides, they carry quite a wide range of funds, although they are more Asian-focused I feel.0 comments0"

5,Alan SeowLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Jun 2018Fund supermart is a good place to consider. As Warren buffett recommends. You might want to try an online brokerage to get Vanguard funds with a very low cost basis. 0 comments0
6,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Jun 2018Adding onto what is being said, you can also consider modern ILPs. I've found significantly good ones with Manulife, AIA and AXA. Most people don't like ILPs, but most people also don't even understand how they work - the article by Dollarsandsense is grossly outdated and BudgetBabe's article on it shows that back in 2016, she didn't even understand the difference between a par fund and an investment fund. ​...well this reply isn't for unnecessary shot firing...​There are certain advantages to modern ILPs because all the platforms listed by Christopher How - and don't get me wrong, they are good platforms and I offer them as well because I am an FA - have an Account Fee. For some ILPs, depending on structure and if you mess around with the NaR, you can actually cap your fees after some years and only pay the management fee of the mutual fund itself. So if your time horizon is extremely long I usually need about 20 -25years for this to be significantly effective, it might actually be better to use an ILP, especially if its in line with your long term goal.​Some people complain about liquidity and surrender charges, but the reality is that if you save for a goal the money should be for that goal. If you break from it, you're just undisciplined. 0 comments0"
