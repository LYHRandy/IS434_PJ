MasterAnswered on 12 Dec 2018Used to do dropship on ebay and amazon, atrending courses on these as well as for fba through a very honest trainer charging low course fews. Used to be profitable for amazon but the algorithm kept changing and margins are np longer what they used to be.. EBay can still be profitable but need quite a bit of research on items. And whatever you do, don't fall for ads touting about making money off kindle books. It won't work as what I've heard. 0 comments0"

I don't think it's that easy and viable anymore. With the availabliity of Taobao anywhere in most country,  i can easily list items I source from Taobao and resell in Amazon USA. However, This also means that anyone in states can also buy direct from Taobao. I have friends as far as Brussel also buy direct from taobao.  So what makes theeBay on the other hand , it's dead! I have not made a single sales on eBay in the last 7 years since the rise of Carousell and Taobao. Not to mentioned the rest like Lazada, Shopee, Ezbuy etc. Thus i've long abadone eBay and channel to other platform. It is possible, just like any other business. It  takes quite a bit of hard work, long term persistent to and pivoting find the right product / market mix and the rest of the effort such as marketing, customer services.  WIth current states of things, it might take at least 3 years to see some sizable fruits by the business, provided the business owner persisted and sustained. However, if you have a product that few or only you can supply , there you have a USP (Unique Selling point / Product) that you can work hard and build on. Good luck! :) 0 comments0"
