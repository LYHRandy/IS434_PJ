4,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Sep 2018There are plenty to know for self-insured. The basics are1) Know your income and expenses.
Income tax, medisave (declaration to CPF as self-employed)
2) Plan your cashflow very well. Plan for 1 year expenses first. (Self employed has unstable income)
3) Calculate your income tax. If assessable income more than $80,000 annum, do your tax relief (SRS preferred) to bring it to the lower bracket of 7%, Since your income tax rate will hit 15%. pass $80,000With regards to your CPF, treat it as a bond segment if you are going BTIR, especially if you are doing retirement sum top up (tax relief up to $7,000).0 comments0"

I feel you!​This is my finance strategy in order of importance which you may consider:​(1) save 6-12 months  worth of expenses to tide through rainy days(2) set up a business operating account where I use this for marketing cost (ie. flyers, SPH ads, facebook marketing)(3) Singapore Savings Bonds because I can earn better interest than FD but still able to redeem within 1 month if I need it if (1) is running low(4) contribute to CPF OA as a lumsum when I am comfortable with the above 3 since this is very illiquid. (5) Start contributing to both CPF SA and OA after OA has $20k ​If you're considering in stocks, I learnt that we should consider our job as part of our portfolio as well. To diversify the risk, I would invest in non-property related stocks so that if the real estate market is doing badly, at least the stocks have less likelihood to be affected. Similarly, during property booms, we may be doing well in career and that should be able to mitigate the loss in the paper assets (if any).​Hope this helps! :)​0 comments0"
