1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 01 May 2019Cryptocurrency is a relatively new investment. Even though it started in 2009; it wasn’t until recent years that it took off. Rather than asking if this is a good time to buy bitcoin, I think you should research more on the cryptocurrency space and blockchain tech. If you believe in it, then you may wanna take a small portion out to invest in it. Don’t try to time the market. Set out guidelines for your portfolio and strategies, and respond and review accordingly. With bitcoin price today, a person that bought bitcoin at 15k and sold at 20k had made more gains that a person that bought bitcoin at 5k. Current price is about 5.2k usd.0 comments2"
