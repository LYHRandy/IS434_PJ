1,"Chin Guo QiangLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 May 2019Too stagnant for the stock movements based off past few years. If you need to know, Singapura Finance has holding power for Ngee Ann City and does commodity trading for essentials such as rice.Hence, Singapura Finance Limited as a company entity is more of supplemental from its core rice distributor business. They are generally not burning a lot of cash but limited growth too.P.S: Singapura Finance Limited is quite a traditional company (was once an employee with them for a few months back in 2014)Hope these information helps ! :)0 comments0"
