question,"Investments Loans Asked by Richard Woon Tian JunAsked on 11 Apr 2019A new form of investment opportunity - instead of earning interest from student loans, investors earn from future earnings? Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Worth, or just take the student loan?https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-09/college-grads-sell-stakes-in-themselves-to-wall-street?srnd=premium-asiaI think this is an extremely interesting concept being raised, but I fear the repercussions - with a new form of security being created, we may see banks try to package this and sell this as a form of ""salary-backed security"". With the previous mortgage backed securities causing the core of the 2008 recession. Would love to hear the community's thoughts on this!1 answerAnswerBump3"
