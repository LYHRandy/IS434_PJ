1,Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2018Yes it is. You can even pay if AFTER you graduate. Check your bank. They would have mentioned which month they will start charging. I think it is July/August. Just make sure you pay before that!0 comments2

The best thing you can do now is to go teach tuition, flexible timing and good $.With that you can save to quickly repay it before interest kick it. Anything extra you have you can save it for holiday. After you started working, if you can cope, you can continue it as a side gig to earn extra income. 0 comments2"
