Grand MasterAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Let me see if I can categorise them:- 1) high academic results required - such as lawyers, doctors, professors, MPs,(usually too late if you in your twenties and not in a good university)2) manual skilled jobs that pays well per hourcrane operators, forklift operators, special machines operators3) sales jobinsurance advisers, property agents, car salesmen, etc4) business ownerssmall medium enterprise owners- learn on how to operate a small businessI see that 1) is usually too late for most of us.2/3/4 are all still available.0 comments2"
2,"Eveline LauLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Jun 2019Don't really understand your question of ""highly value"" skilled jobs - highly valued skilled jobs or high-value skilled jobs? They would mean different things.If you're talking about more labourous kind of skilled jobs, you'll need a license and they can be high risk (e.g. compromise on health or safety). If you're talking about non-labourous ones, you'll need to be at least educated at the tertiary level on it (e.g. graduated from medical school to be a doctor, law school for a lawyer). Tuition teachers can earn quite a bit of money but in order to be one that can rack in the money, you'll need to be a MOE-certified teacher, meaning you would need to have studied in and graduated from NIE. Studying in NIE comes with a 5-year bond, which you'll need to serve by working as a teacher in a public school.The money comes with sacrifice, just in which form :p0 comments2"

ProdigyAnswered on 13 Jun 2019Tuition teacherFirst- decide what to teachThen, sign up your name on a couple of tuition websites to increase awareness and with patience and consistency you can earn minimum $40/h, higher if you're more qualified ie. relevant degree in subject you are teachingTips: You don't have to be an expert, you just have to be passionate about the subject and it will show in your interaction with the students and parents will be quick to spot tutors who aren't pulling their weight! Once you've built your reputation, you'll be a 'highly valued' tutor and every student or rather the parents will be signing up for your slot! :)0 comments1"

5,"See all 4 comments Justin Kieran Ong10 Jun 2019I'm not too sure about the exact process but judging from the rest of the Aerospace insudtry it's probably something like this. 

When you are selected, you will go through a training school. Once you pass, you'll start as a ATC.Eveline Lau10 Jun 2019Air traffic controller has to go through stringent training and pass it. The courses should be completed within a year, if I'm not wrong, and if you fail to pass, you'll be kicked out of the job/programme. Training bond is 2 years. While the pay is good, remember it's a shift job. Typically shift job pays much better because it can be detrimental to the health (most of my friends who work shift job ballooned in size and they all look like pandas around their eyes, for example).

Surgeons need more than just steady hands lah hahaha"

Super high value jobs that not anyone can do.Others will include high risk jobs such as Rope access specialists. High risk, high skill needed. These people need to ensure rope safety as they are accessing high buildings or structures with just ropes. Any mistake results in death.0 comments0"
