1,"Ross MamminoLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 24 Jun 2019This is a scam.  Singapore's financial regulatory authority has no such  broker as Goldman Sutton & Partners listed on their register.   The  Singapore government doesn't even have them registered as a business  entity for tax purposes. It's a boilerroom investment fraud.  That's when a  foreign broker makes unsolicited contact with you and seduces you into  investing in what he says will be a lucrative deal.   You end up with  nothing and they run off with your money. I would say the reply below (Kenneth Tan) has been put there by them.Stay well away from this mob.Try and search and you will find nothing execpt their web page, any other report on the scam are pulled down by them.You can get around that by signing into sites like this with facebook and they cant take it down as the Facebook member is the only one that can take it down.0 comments1"
2,"Osama AgamiLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 22 Sep 2019Definite spam They dragged me into buying shares and can't get any cent back for the past 6 months, always one man answers the phone and tells me he will refer me to someone else, one has been abusing me, another one keeps telling me they will pay me back and never happen, They do not exist in Singapore, and like other posts, you can not find much about them on the internet except their own sites.0 comments0"

5,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jul 2019Never heard of them. Not much info on them when I searched too.If you are looking for a brokerage service, there are many local ones that are reputable and have been around for very long. You can check out POEMS/Philips, Lim and Tan, DBS Vickers, FSM One, Maybank Kim Eng, UOB Kay Hian, Standard Chartered Online Trading, Interactive Brokers, Think or Swim and many more1 comment0"
