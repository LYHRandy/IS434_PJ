1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 02 Apr 2019Hi there! I started by investing in a traditional high yield savings account, to take advantage of compounding! I personally use both the DBS Multiplier account and POSB SAYE Account. To maximize the interest rates (2.0% p .a.), I deposit a fixed amount every month from the DBS multiplier account to the POSB saye account. I like having a separate savings account because it prevents me from touching the money and let the effect of compounding be maximized!0 comments3"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 02 Apr 2019When I was 20 with less capital and more energy, here are the things I invested in:- My knowledge and connections. I spent as much time as possible getting industry knowledge and forming connections in the industry that I wanted to work in. - My savings. I was starting from zero, so I made it a point to put aside as much as I can, so that I can benefit from compound interest from an earlier age. - My health. I focused on health a little later in life, but I wanted to mention this because I feel that it is something that many at 20 ignore.0 comments2"
3,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 03 Mar 2019When I was 20, I was busy studying in university to meet my scholarship obligations and build my portfolio to help me land a job once I graduated. If I could turn back time to being 20 again, I would still probably be busy with the same, but will put my money in a high yield savings account / Singapore Savings Bonds instead of leaving it in POSB where I earned 0.05% per annum.0 comments0"
