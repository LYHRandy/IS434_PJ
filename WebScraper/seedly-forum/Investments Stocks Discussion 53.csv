question,"Investments Stocks Discussion Asked by Isla LeahAsked on 04 Sep 2019Is it wise to buy DBS Blue Chip Stock via OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan?So I wanted to try investing in blue-chip stock through the OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan since the fee I'll have to pay is 0.88% of the total investment. As I am a student, I planned to try only the minimum which is $100 per month. However, I noticed that DBS share price is more than $100/stock, so is it a bad idea to purchase their shares since I can only purchase 1 stock at most?2 answersAnswerBump1"

DBS is hovering around $24-$25 per share these days, so you will likely only be able to get 3-4 shares each time (factoring in the fees). What you really need to take note is that you will have slight difficult liquidating unit shares as shares are commonly traded in lots of 100.Considering that you are a student, don't rush in. Take time to build up knowledge so that you will be able to decide when and how to invest your (currently) limited resources. Grow your human capital too so that you can increase your earning power which will enable you to make a much bigger quantum of investments in order to reduce the costs of investment.3 comments6"

I was considering singapore savings bonds as well, but maturity is 10 years although it can be withdrawn anytime, which makes me a little less keen on the idea. Would love to hear more if possible and thank you!Elijah Lee10 Sep 2019I would normally not invest in shares if my capital is small, largely due to the costs of investing. Also, as we are buying a single company if we buy shares, we actually need a fair bit of capital in order to diversify sufficiently. Let these principles guide you. Perhaps you can consider UTs first as a means of diversification instead of buying individual shares, where your risk is higher. For SSBs, there's really no harm to get some, since they are fairly liquid and risk free."

RookieAnswered 4w agoSince you can gain from Dollar-cost averaging over time, while per month you will get 4-5 shares, over time this will accumulate and you will enjoy dividends from the stock too. Most popular for Blue Chip Investment Plan is the AM Nikko basket of shares that covers a larger range to diversify.
