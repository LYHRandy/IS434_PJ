1,"Darren ChewLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 15 Jun 2019These 2 reits are quite different and are not able to compare directly.Mapletree Commercial Trust is considered as a diversified REITS rather than office reit as around 40% - 50% of their revenue is generate from VivoCity. 3 out of 4 of his office building is located outside CBD. It is also one of the few pure Singapore play reits left.
Capitaland Commercial Trust have almost all their Singapore office building located in the heart of the CBD. It has also expanded out of Singapore and enter the Germany market.
To me, both are very good reits which have strong sponsor that have a global reach. If you can only choose 1 from the 2, based on current market condition, I will recommend Mapletree Commercial Reits as it is a reits that comprise of both retail and office which make it more defensive in nature.
Hope that help.0 comments6"
