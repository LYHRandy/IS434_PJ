1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Setting up a company (private limited) will carry itself more hassle. A one time setup cost will be needed (there are many companies that offers setup services). Having a company will require more stringent in areas like accounting. You can outsource company secretarial services, tax and accounting/book keeping. But it will also come at a cost as well. They will cost u several hundreds to thousand+ a year depending on your requirements.It really depends on the nature of your business. What are the business risk of your business? What is the growth outlook for your business? Will u want to look for investor or partner shareholder? A company will help u with these, limit your financial liability, allows u to sell stakes of your company in future, might have a better perceived image(company vs individual), and better tax management etc etc.For now if u just looking at tax savings at current figure, it might not be a good idea. Your payable tax now is just #3k+. The first $80k is $3350. Every dollar above is 11.5% till $120k. I'm not sure if it is your taxable income (after deducting your tax relief like medisave topup etc). After the annual additional cost for company setup, your effective tax savings is prob under $2k or lesser. But if u forsee your net income will grow quickly over 100k and more, it might make sense to setup a company now. It is better to have a proper system in place now, ready to grow your business bigger. More details about your business are needed before we can really come out with the pros and cons. You can probably start by checking out the many company that offers incorporation services (including the corp secretaries, bookkeeping etc services) 4 comments0"

Eg, your taxable income is >$80k, for every dollar u earn above 80k is taxed at 11.5%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 11.5% of $1000 = $115 tax money. Effectively have gotten 11.5% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-5% interest yearly guaranteed.
If u setup a company in future, u can do this for your employee (yourself) which your company will earn the tax relief and for yourself (personal tax).Yixiong Chang18 Nov 2018Do add me on facebook if i can help u with more personal financial advice. "
