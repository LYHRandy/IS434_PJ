God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoHi, the management fee is part of the total expense ratio. For mother funds, they have their own layer of fees, however, for most fund houses, there is usually an internal arrangement that limits or even remove the fees arising from a fund feeding into a mother fund.1 comment2"
