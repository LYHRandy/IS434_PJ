question,Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Sep 2018I’m thinking of starting to invest $1.5k in STI ETF and $500 in S&P next month onwards using DCA. Is it wise considering that it’s bearish for STI ETF and yet all time high for S&P ?6 answersAnswerBump1

1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Jan 2019How do you intend to buy into the S&P through a DCA method? I'll assume you are referring the S27 SGX counter? There is no automatic way of buying into S27 and the minimum share lot is 10, which works out to be US$2650~ per transaction based on today's prices. If you are buying to SPY, you are looking at perhaps 1 share a month based on your $500 contribution. Which doesn't make sense, as the brokerage fees will be quite high.Unless you are thinking of buying into the Infinity S&P500 fund issued by LionGlobal, in which case I'll suggest you stay far away. The fees are rather high which will eat a big chunk of your paper gains over time.0 comments1"

DCA is supposed to remove the aspect of market timing and keep you invested whether at market top or bottom. ​The longer you hold the better0 comments0"
