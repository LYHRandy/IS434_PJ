question,"Fresh Graduates Robo-advisors Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Oct 2018I'm a fresh grad, new to investing here. Does it make sense for me to invest in both STI ETF and Robo-Advisors to diversify? What should the split be in terms of how much to invest?Hi! I'm looking to take out around $350-$400 of my salary to invest. Have read through a number of Seedly articles, but I'm still confused. Does it make sense for me to diversify by buying STI ETF + Robo-Advisors (Global ETF)? What's the benefit of diversifying, if I'm looking to hold this for the next 5-10 years when according to what I read, there's generally an upward trend in terms of returns? (As compared to only buying STI or only Global ETF)How should I decide the split?5 answersAnswerBump1"

WizardAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Yeah this makes sense :) and this is Actually what I kind of do also... along with other individual stocks.​so largely you invest in both the local market (where you live) in this case Singapore... and also the global market which is often rooting from companies in the US... which robo advisors often buy the ETFs from.​A split to me would be leaning 70% global (USA and Asia ex japan) and 30% sti etf, because to me, much of my market exposure here in the local market comes from our daily lives already, working here etc. 0 comments3"

Diversifying through ETFs are good because if you start with a small amount of capital, you cannot invest in a whole lot of companies. ETF allows you to buy into more companies and also spread your risk. If one industry example IT/Healthcare and so on are not doing well, the other companies or industries will still be doing ok and your ETF wont drop too badly. For split, you have to think yourself. Like how much risk are you willing to take and are the returns for the risks worth for you. You can do half half split if we are not including bonds.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 08 Oct 2018Mm perhaps you can have a read through Andrew Hallam's millionaire teacher book where he talked about a couch potato strategy using Etfs (global equity, local country Etf and a bond one) before you proceed further. I'll suggest vanguard for their low costs if you can get access to them via an offshore broker. Hope this helps 0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Oct 20181) Have a diversified portfolio not just in geographies, but also asset class, and sectors.2) Diversifying means that you're trying to reduce risk by not putting all your eggs in one basket.We do this by trying to negate too much positive correlation and volatility in the portfolio.3) This can mean adding bonds, property, commodities into your portfolio other than just 100% equity.4) There are 6 major global markets you can invest in.USUKEurope excluding UKJapanAsia excluding JapanEmerging Market(There are a few others that are quite niche, I won't cover that) We have the added advantage of investing in purely Singapore. Which is a very microscopic area to invest in, and I would personally avoid for equities, but love for bonds (due to our top notch investment grade rating)So when you want to diversify globally, I would suggest picking funds that individually invests in these markets than a total global fund.This is so you can choose your percentage of allocation for each region, and over and under weight them as you see fit. 0 comments0"
