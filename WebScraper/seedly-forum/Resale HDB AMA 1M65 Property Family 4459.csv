1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I cannot tell you what you should do but here is my advice. I am not a big believer of property as a good investment vehicle.The 2 reasons for property prices to rise are Population Growth and Economic Growth. At the moment, none of these are growing in Singapore right now, hence I will not invest much into property right now and for many years to come.That said, I make sure that I am not overleveraged on my property purchase and it is not stretched beyond my purchasing power. On that note, I have always lived in HDB and I am very comfortable in it.I will be skeptical of using property as a tool for retirement because it does not necessary grow well and there is a lot of property risks involved.It is also my view that Government being very careful about property bubbles being formed and regularly step in to prick little bubbles that brew in the property market. 1 comment3"
2,"Question Poster08 Nov 2018Appreciate your perspectives. Thank you. Would you say, a balanced approach would be to retain the existing condo (since it is only 3 years old and there is little to gain from the sale since the value hasn't risen much) and pay the monthly instalments by cash? In this way, contributions to our CPF OA and SA will grow.   "

I might want to ask what would be your goal here? 3 comments0"

Will moving to a different place affect negativing for yourself(travel to work) and your child (travel to study)? It can be disruptive for your child at this time. 
If you expect property prices to rise over the next decade or so (which your option2 is suggesting), u can hold on to your current condo till then to downsize. Your child could be near wanting to marry and moved out to his own unit. By then u will be at a better position to 'downsize', even better since u want to retire by then, u will have a greater cash pool (by selling your condo), or renting it out. Yixiong Chang09 Nov 2018Have u ever considered topping up CPF special account? Actually I would

You will earned a guaranteed rate of 4%. Risk-free, regardless of market conditions.
In additional u will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additio... (more)"
