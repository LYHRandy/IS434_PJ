Market Risk are trade war, asian financial crisis, dot com crisis or global financial crisis. All these risk cannot be diversify or reduce by portfolio diversification because you got no control over it.Non-Market Risk are risk that affecting the company that invested in. This risk can be reduce through portfolio diversification.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Would you prefer owning $100000 worth of stocks of one company or split over 100 companies?The second option means that you're not having your eggs in one basket.If one company goes bankrupt, you lose 1% of your holding instead of 100% of your holding. Now it is also important to understand correlation. If all 100 companies are selling TVs for example, and tomorrow TVs become obsolete, you're still screwed. So you need to diversify across sectors, geographies, and asset classes to achieve a balanced portfolio that can weather storms for long term sustainable growth.0 comments1"

Hence, if an unfortunate event occurs, the impact on your portfolio will be lessened as Hariz has mentioned.Basically you can diversify this risk away by developing a portfolio of varied asset classes from different industries and different fundamentals. But the cool thing is that you can actually cut your risk, but not cut your returns. This is what investors refer to firm-specific risk or diversifiable risk. By investing in a diversified portfolio, you are cutting this risk away, but your returns can still remain the same. However, all stocks will be affected by market risk, which is the risk that all stocks will be exposed to across the market. This risk cannot be diversified away. In finance, we will only be awarded with higher returns when we take on higher market risk (measured by a firm's Beta), but not higher diversifiable risk. I would say that the key here is in building a portfolio that are affected by different events. This could be economic, political, business or even geographic events. Hence, you should try to understand the fundamentals of your investments as much as you can.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019If you buy purely stocks related to finance like banks and you get hit by an economic crisis like in 2008, you will lose a lot of money. But if you buy different sectors and add in bonds to the mix, your loss will be reduced and you will feel better that you lose lesser than others.0 comments0"
