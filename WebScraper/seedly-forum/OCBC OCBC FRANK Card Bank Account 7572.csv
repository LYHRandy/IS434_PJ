2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Hey, would advise you to park it in CIMB Fastsaver which gives 1% interest. Currently using that account with DBS Remix. It allows FAST transfer instantly with no service fees so you can easily transfer funds that you need to your savings account with an ATM card like DBS Remix or OCBC FRANK. Personally prefer to use DBS as my main account for more convenience. Parked my life savings, emergency funds and excess savings in CIMB Fastsaver. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Maxi gain has a min of 15k and you need to keep the money without touching for a longer period to earn the int. might not be ideal in your case​i would remember Cimb or uob one acc if you are able to take up and spend 500 dollar a month. This will help with the non salary credit0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 16 May 2018As mentioned in previous answers, CIMB FastSaver looks really tempting and is definitely a great option. ​Citi MaxiGain Savings Account is also interesting but requires you to maintain and continuously increase your balance. And thus use the account, mostly, to stash away your emergency cash. ​0 comments1"

8,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018If you have above S$10,000, Citibank's maxi gain is your best bet for just leaving it there untouched. Base interest of 80% of monthly SIBOR rate, and accumulative 0.1% bonus interest every month (max 1.2% after 12 months). Try to ask for waiver of monthly fee if you don't have enough to meet the Total Relationship Management amount of S$15,000 (you didn't hear it from me here). I had mine waived permanently long ago and I was no where near the TRM amount. (and no, you didn't hear it from me here).​Other than this, CIMB as several others have mentioned here is a good alternative at 1% up to S$50,000.​If you are keen, Singapore Savings Bond can give higher interest over a 10 year period which you can explore as well. ​Hope this helps.0 comments0"
