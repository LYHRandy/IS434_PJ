God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I have not seen the funds available yet but the product structure seems fine. I think you can compare this quite well to AXA Wealth Treasure. I'll need to do a fee breakdown to make sure. I haven't received training for this product yet. I'll check back to this question next week.But ultimately if there aren't good enough funds to build an above average risk adjusted portfolio, you could be better off, buying funds directly with a lower wrap fee by a human advisor.2 comments3"
2,"Question Poster01 Apr 2019Thank you for your input!!Hariz Arthur Maloy3w agoAlright I've seen the product. It's pretty decent. If bought for long term and held throughout the policy, you'll only need 1.25% p.a to break even from the fund fees. I've managed to create a decent portfolio from the funds available as well."
