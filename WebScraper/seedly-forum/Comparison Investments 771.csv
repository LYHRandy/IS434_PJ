1,"SKShabir Khan, Graduate Of Aviation Management & Services at Temasek PolytechnicLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 24 Jul 2019Hi,When you link your CDP to your trading account, the stocks you buy through your brokerage are sent to your CDP to be held under your name. As for linking it to your savings account, I think you mean the Direct Crediting Service(DCS), which is used to payout dividends earned, so when you link your savings account to CDP, dividends you receive are payed out to you savings account through DCS. So there isnâ€™t really any comparison as they are used for different purposes. Hope this helps.0 comments1"
2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you intend to invest in Singapore stocks, you will need a CDP account. A CDP account is needed to store your shares. If a brokerage lets you invest and does not require you to open a CDP account, it probably means that the brokerage is holding your shares for you (ie: they are the custodian of your shares). Not that is bad, but some people do not like someone else holding their shares for them.3 comments1"
