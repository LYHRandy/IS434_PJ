GeniusAnswered on 27 May 2019If you are already fulfilling your OCBC criterias and not yet exceed your $75,000 limit cap, why not just put it in OCBC.However, if you have already exceeded the maximum limit for your 360, the Fast Saver would be hassle free.0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 26 May 2019I recommend the Citibank's Maxigain savings account - no frills, no salary credit, no minimum spend.Your Citi MaxiGain account balance can earn a base and bonus interest rate of up to 2.2% interest per annum, up to the first S$150k I believe.I use Citibank Maxigain for my savings, followed by Standard Chartered. For the rest of it, I then put it into CIMB Fastsaver.0 comments1"
