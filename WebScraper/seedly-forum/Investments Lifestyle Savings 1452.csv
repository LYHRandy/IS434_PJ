1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Apr 2019Short answer, yes.I wouldn't even call it an asset. It is a liability. From the moment you drive out of the dealer's shop, your car value immediately drop. SGcarmart tells you how much a car depreciate per month or year. How they get that value is beyond me, but it is a combination of a lot of calculations.0 comments3"
2,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 02 May 2019Normal car is a liability due to the need to feed petrol, maintaining and changing parts to ensure machines working as intended. Not to mention the time need to bring it to repair, servicing. Rare collection could be an exotic investment that may bring returns when you sell it years later but maintenance is even higher while owning the car. Either way we look at it , it's merely a machine that brings us from Point A to Point B. In Singapore context, it is a very bad investment. If you have a lot of extra $, it is fine. Otherwise, your $ gives you better returns anywhere else other than gambling it away. CheersðŸ˜ƒ0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 02 May 2019I do kind of agree with the rest that it kind of depends on how you define ""depreciation"" and ""asset"".Putting definitions aside, the value of most items can drop when they are second-hand due to several reasons. For example, there could be obsolence, damage of the good or the goods not being as ""fresh"" as possible. Hence, it shouldn't be surprising that the value of cars drop over time, as with many other assets. In fact, the value of certain models of laptops drop quite quickly over time as well.0 comments2"

5,"See all 3 comments Hariz Arthur Maloy30 Apr 2019In accounting, the car is a depreciating asset, the loan is the liability, and tax, maintenance and the depreciation are all expenses. 

Agreed on the ""car can make you more money"" and can be an investment aspect.STSerene Toh02 May 2019True but donâ€™t think there is such a market in Singapore. In addition, the base cost of cars are too high in Singapore for vintage cars to appreciate enough to make an earning."

GeniusAnswered on 02 May 2019An (appreciating) asset puts money into your pocket.A liability takes money out of your pocket.When you buy and use a car, you need to take money out of your pocket for expenses such as fuel, maintenance, parking fee, etc.Therefore, the car is a liability.0 comments1"
7,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 May 2019It really depends on what the term ""asset"" means to you.In accounting terms, ""asset"" means anything that has a price that you can sell off to generate cash etc. Income generating is something that produce income (can be dividend, royalty, etc etc)Depreciating means it is losing value over time. Cash itself depreciates through inflation. Car loses its sale value over time. So yes, a car is a depreciating asset. If it is used in business to generate income, it is a income generating depreciating asset.0 comments0"
