question,"Bank Account DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card DBS DBS Multiplier OCBC 360 OCBC Credit Card Savings Family Expenses Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Aug 2019Looking to make a switch from DBS Multiplier to OCBC 365. Should I close my account entirely?Hi, I'm a 27 y/o using a DBS Multiplier Account + a DBS Altitude Card. I'm looking to take on bill payments for my parents (telco, utility bills, insurance). Because the DBS Altitude doesn't give me any miles for bill payments + insurance, I'm looking to switch over to OCBC 365. I'm not looking to keep too many cards or bank accounts so I might close the DBS Multiplier when I move over to OCBC. Is it ok to do that? Does this affect my credit score or should I consider keeping the DBS account up?2 answersAnswerBump0"

Personally I keep multiple bank accounts as it
1. Makes it easy to segregate my money so I only touch what is in my spending account 
2. DBS ATMs often have long queues so I just draw money at OCBC ATMs which usually have nobody and then ibank money between my own accounts lol0 comments1"
