And even these 2 tend to dwindle in time due to lack of publicity.I exclude property (one popular ""passive income"" of Singapore) because it is really not passive. There is maintenance involved. Any time an issue pops up, your tenants are going to call you up for piping, electricity, carpeting, door windows issue etc.You probably need to get new tenants now and then and check on stuff.Probably semi-passive?I do options trading and I count that as semi-passive income too. You still have to check the portfolio every 1 week or so and renew expiring trades to get the stream of income.Passive income is not as easy as sold in stories and books.0 comments2"
