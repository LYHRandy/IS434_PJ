1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Nov 2018I think there is no harm in creating a CDP account. You lose nothing, except for a bit of time which is used for application process. No charges nor minimum trades! 0 comments0"
2,"Charmaine Lim XiaomeiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Nov 2018I think it boils down to the type of investment you are looking at. You can refer to this article here that lists the pros and cons of CDP vs Custodian: https://blog.seedly.sg/cdp-vs-custodian-account/Moreover, there is no requirement for min trades with CDP and you can leave your account untouched with no charges! Therefore, I think you should open an account even if you have no use for it now because it will take approx 2-3 weeks for your application to be approved!0 comments0"
