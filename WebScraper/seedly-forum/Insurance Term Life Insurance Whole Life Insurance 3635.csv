MasterUpdated 3w agoYou have to ask yourself whether the additional premiums to be paid, versus the coverage, versus getting the term plan is worth it or not. I can't really advise on anything... butMathematically, if the premium is 1% of the sum assured, after 40 years, you would have saved and invested (at 4%) that amount to reach the full coverage.For 2% premiums to the coverage, it takes about 27 years.For 3% premiums to the coverage, it takes about 21 years.I hope this forms a guideline.0 comments0"
