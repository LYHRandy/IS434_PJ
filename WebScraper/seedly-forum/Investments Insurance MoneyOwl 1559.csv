I am Chris, Executive Director of MoneyOwl as well as CEO of Providend. Guo Hao is right to say that the team at MoneyOwl is the same team as DIYInsurance in the past. We went into a JV with NTUC Enterprise to form MoneyOwl to provide more services beyond insurance planning. Over the next few months, we will be rolling out other services. Do keep a look out for them. Eddy Cheong, who is the Chief Advisory Officer of MoneyOwl looking after the advisory team has almost 20 years of experience in financial advsiory. So you can be assured that the advice that leaves MoneyOwl is good.
