1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 13 Jun 2019Usually the dividends from foreign stocks are credited to your brokerage account. Because the stocks are held in custodian account of the broker.Tax on dividends depend on which country the stocks are from. US, 30% dividend tax. HK, no tax. Malaysia, yes. Can check with broker exactly which country and how much is the dividend tax1 comment1"
