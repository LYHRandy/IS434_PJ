question,Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Sep 2018Our current HDB resale flat is 35 years old and we only moved in 2 years ago. How do we gauge when is a good time to start looking for the next property?My wife and I moved in 2 years ago and we are worried that our resale flat will lose its value if we live here too long. When do we know if it’s a good time to start looking for a new property? We are both working professionals with a combined income of approximate $9000. Thank you all in advance!9 answersAnswerBump1

1,"Petrine TangLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You would have lost a certain pool of buyers after your flat turns 40 years old. That's because buyers can't use their cpf for the flat after it is 70 years old. For flats that are in between 40-70 years old (meaning remaining lease of 60-30 years), buyer's age plus remaining lease must be at least 80 years for them to still be able to use cpf and/or take max loan. Or else they have to buy your flat using more cash. Unless your house is in a prime district and many people are willing to spend cash, I would say your flat loses value after 40 years. 2 comments2"

3,"Nicholas Woon, Marketing Director at ERA Realty Network Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 26 Sep 2018As what Petrine mentioned, when a property remaining lease reaches 60 years and lower, the next buyer must be able to stay in your flat until they are age 80 if not he/she wouldn't be able to use CPF OA to finance your unit. ​Since after you reach MOP, your unit will have a remaining lease of 61 years, I would urge you to sell by then before it hits the 60 year mark.This is a rough idea of how your HDB value may go after the 60 year mark. This appeared in the Straits Times last year (2017) link: https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/will-you-still-love-your-hdb-flat-when-its-over-64​Although I would take this with a pinch of salt after the recent National Day Rally where PM Lee introduced the VERS (Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme).link: https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/vers-allows-for-more-orderly-redevelopment ​The government assured that HDB owners would be able to opt for VERS when the lease is ending and HDB would give a 'reasonable' compensation unlike SERS (Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme) which has a windfall effect. However, we would not know what is considered a 'reasonable' compensation since no one has undergone this program yet. ​In a nutshell, I would recommend selling your place after you reach MOP. Even if you are not interested to upgrade to an EC or private condo, you should find a resale HDB with a younger age to be on the safe side!0 comments1"
4,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2018It would be good to sell before the HDB flat reaches 40 years old. However, you need to fulfill your 5 years MOP before you can sell. You may also want to reconsider whether you want to just breakeven, make a profit or a loss, taking into account of your interest and loan repayments amount. 0 comments1"
5,"Kelvid PangLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 24 Sep 2018I believe your house buy value consider good and should be able to make profit after 5 years when you meet Minimum Occupation Period (MOP). Personally, I'll sell it and buy another one although I may incur additional charges and taxes but the HDB over 40 years old will be hard to sell with the additional rules and regulation except your house location is very good.0 comments1"
6,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2018I think a good time is about 50ish ​you did not mention the location of the property. Given that the location is good this number can be extended to 60-70 ​if you plan to live Long term then apply for an executive unit.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 201899-38=61 yrs lease left after mop then you can sell ur existing flat.You only sell ur flat bcos u are offered a good price and you have a better place to stay.If selling it at a loss or paying high amount of accurrred cpf interest then you have to re consider ur options without an affordable better location to stay.You can refer to the Mop tables herehttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1383799236311&d=Touch&pagename=InfoWEB%2FPage%2FArticleDetailPageIs good to go thru this for the lease left issueAt 64 yearsWith less than 35 years of lease left, banks are unwilling to extend loans to finance the purchase of these flats. That applies to flats that are at least 64 years old.At 69 yearsWith less than 30 years of lease remaining, CPF money cannot be used for down payment or to service the monthly mortgage.At 79 yearsAt this point, the property has to be paid for in cash.When leases drop to 20 years and below, the prospective buyers will not be able to get HDB loans, bank loans or use CPF for the purchase. Everything has to be paid in cash in one go.Source:https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/buying-an-old-hdb-flat-here-are-some-things-to-considerHope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments1"
8,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Oct 2018Now would be a good time. I generally advise against 30yo flats as there is usually no upside (unless mrt built just beside the hdb) and the only way is down. Usually stagnant value from 30 to 40, then start depreciating. Maybe take a look at URA website to see if there will be any favourable developments at your area. 0 comments0"

10,"Nicholas ChanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 24 Sep 2018Under current legislation, u should try to sell your place while it still has >70 years lease left. After that, it gets harder for buyers to borrow. That said the government has plans for upgrades & VERS, if u really like your place, u can hold on to it & see what schemes the government rolls out. 0 comments0"
