1,"Glenn Toh, Founder at Whatcard.sgLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 13 Jul 2019Hi there, currently the best credit card reward we know of for Grabpay topups is through the UOB One card, mainly because of the very generous extra 5% cashback on ALL Grab transactions (including topup, Grab Food, Grab rides) that is given above and beyond the standard cashback tiers for UOB One card (up to 5%). At a maximum cashback rate of 8-10%, this will give a higher value than any miles cards we know of (that give at most 4 miles/dollar on Grab)We also wrote a longer article detailing how to maximise cashback on UOB One card through Grabpay topups that you may be interested to check out to learn how to get the maximum rewards on Grab0 comments0"
