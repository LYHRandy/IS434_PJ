1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Dependent's Protection Scheme: A $46000 Term to 60. Payable with OA.Home Protection Scheme: A Mortgage Reducing Term that pays for any outstanding HDB mortgage owed. Payable with OA.Medishield Life: A Hospitalization & Surgical Insurance that covers you for life that subsidizes B2/C Ward Stays and certain limits to certain surgical procedures up to $100k/yr. Payable with Medisave.Eldershield/Careshield Life (soon): A Long Term Care Insurance plan that covers you for life and pays you for life in the event of the inability to perform 3/6 Activities Of Daily Living starting from $600/m escalating at 2% per annum. Payable with Medisave.CPF Life: An Annuity Payout from 65 for life @ 9.5% drawdown payout of the Full Retirement Sum when you turn 55. Payable with your OA + SA.These are the most basic of coverage and gives you an idea of what you need to do extra. All of them should be ""Upgraded"" by getting private plans for yourself.Govt care if you die, get disabled, cannot pay for house, need to go hospital, or live too long, but don't care if you get a Critical Illness. There's no provision made for this yet.2 comments5"

3,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Uh. Sounds like you're starting off pretty wrong - if you don't trust your agent, don't meet them, or at least give them the opportunity to establish trust. If you want to be clear of your current protection, bring your policies to the meeting. At the very least, you'll be able to establish your agent's competence. If someone has an old policy that doesn't require surrendering in favor of better opportunities (higher returns) or burdens (paying till age 88 for example, where the client has shown frustration), the agent should account for the existing policy and give you recommendations to make up the coverage lacking. For the answer to your question, all Singapore citizens can buy (in relation to Life Insurance), not the others. Death:  And Terminal IllnessDisability: Eldershield, Eldershield upgrades, Work disability, Total and Permanent Disability PlansCI: Early Critical Illness, Intermediate Critical Illness, Late Critical Illness, attached to anything from a Term to a Whole life to an Investment linked policyPA:  Personal Accident (standalone), Personal accident plans with glitter and sparkles (such as hospital benefits and reimbursements, etc)Hospitalization: Shield plans and ridersYou may or may not need all of these, depending on your specific situation and what coverage you already have. I suggest you have that agent  reviewing help you categorize your existing policies for you, so you can mark it off like a checklist. If you want a second opinion, you can always reach me: https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54But honestly, don't go into that meeting with that kind of negativity. You'll likely only compromise yourself. If you're really terrified of being sold something unnecessary, either you find someone more ethical or someone who has no temptation in that area because you've paid them thousands of dollars upfront (eg. Providend).2 comments2"
4,"Question Poster15 Oct 2018Thank you for listing down. I was thinking of actually asking what kind of policies the government has and what it matches to? For example. Medisave, Medishield etc. as I hear alot of people say that we are already covered sufficiently with those policies and why do we need to get extra coverage?Luke Ho16 Oct 2018For government you're automatically covered through Medishield Life (hospitalization needs), which is payable by Medisave. It is extremely, extremely basic insurance coverage for when you're hospitalized for any reasons. If you're over 40, you're automatically enrolled into Eldershield (a total and permanent disability insurance) unless you voluntarily opt out.
