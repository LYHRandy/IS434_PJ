1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Sep 2018I'll hire all the above, on the account of good attitude. because:1) No experience, great uni results: Can learn / work and accumulate experience.2) With work experience, average results: If willing to do and learn, with the experience, also helps to excel. 3) Bad results, willing to learn: This shows good attitude. Bad results could be not interested in the boring stuff or just some red tape system.​So all 3 above, if you find someone with good attitude, regardless of their knowledge or results or background, as long as they are willing to learn, willing to do. They can beat any system and deliver results! I believe with the right / great attitude, one can go very far! :) ​Cheers! :) 0 comments1"
2,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would hire 1 and 2.​No exp but great results, this shows he can really study and learn. Have the grit and determination to achieve great results. ​Work exp is ok​Did badly in school but willing to learn. This is hard. If he was willing to learn, why did badly in school? 3 comments1"

Hao Yu18 Sep 2018There can be many different what ifs scenario but it is hard for an employer to be able to find out all this information in the hiring process. If there is a way to find out, I’m at sure employers will be willing to give people that you described a chance. The question is how to find out such information and validate it. "
4,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 05 Apr 2019There are people who are super book smart, but not the best team players. Likewise, there are those who are not book smart, but are natural problem solvers irl.I would go for 2 - work experience and average results. This is especially so if the candidate has demonstrated the two things - Aptitude x Attitude.That said, the best proof of a great team mate is really during the probation period.#truestory - I have had a marketing person work for me (lets call this person K). While K seemed pretty good on paper, here are the initial red flags when K came in as a digital marketing professional whose job was to head up all social marketing efforts (largely in English):Did not know what Reddit was (surprising to me given K's CV)Requested for a budget to use bots for social media marketingHad so many basic grammatical errors in social media content, it took our BD guy so much time to correct that he should have just taken over K's jobNow, the above red flags are issues with aptitude, and if K had a good attitude, it would have been ok. But, in the first few weeks, K also:Mentioned that K was sick, and had to take sick leave (ok)K's bunny was sick too, so K once again had to take sick leave (ok - because who am I to say bunnies don't need care too)Got all huffy and did not want to work with another team member pointed out inappropriate usage of hashtags in social media postsHad to take sick leave again, but was seen as personal social media going to parties and also abroad over the weekend. Clearly, that was the last straw.Ultimately, the best time to evaluate is during the probation period. It is also especially useful because its key to see how the new hire works with the team.Hope it helps!0 comments0"

6,"Serene Toh03 Oct 2018I actually considered this probation idea too. I totally agree that its the fairest method. But its not realistic, because a normal company would not want to waste resources to train 3 people at the same time for 1 job. Plus it means that for that 1st month, they have to pay 3 salaries.  But reading this reminds me of the old JDramas I watched many years ago, about those Large Corporate that have mass annual recruitment. Anyone knows if this is still relevant or even exist in Singapore?Terence Tan, CMT19 Jul 2019Actually it's still very common especially in banks, it's what we call ""hire-and-fire"". Basically a batch of new hirers comes in, work for 6 months to a year, the top half are kept, the rest are reviewed and most asked to leave unless they can be aptly fitted elsewhere in the organization."
7,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Sep 2018My ranking will be1) Work experiance & average results. (no need to teach from scratch)2) Fresh graduate with great university results (at least got required knowledge)3) Badly in school but very willing to learn (can't tell unless you know the person)​The ranking is based on not knowing anything about the individuals except the above and applying fo the same entry level job, (desk job). If not desk based job, ranking will be still be experience first, willing to learn & fresh graduate will have same ranking.​That said, I understand that there are other factors at play, and results don't really mean whether you succeed or not, but we also need to be realistic and realise that HR is not going to take their time to know you before they hire.​(no. 3 may find it difficult to get hired, but if they truely are willing to learn & can do well, they are likely to have an advantage at promotion after they get hired)0 comments0"
8,"ZeeeeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Sep 2018I guess all three could be put to a probation/internship as it is really hard to decide from a mere resume. Job experience in a certain firm doesn't ensure he's well versed at that area of expertise, it just means he knows a certain component in that area well. Good grades doesn't prove one will be well adept in a business like setting either. It is only through being on the ground, and observed by HR where one can be fairly assessed  0 comments0"
9,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018If I have to choose only 1 among the 3, I'll choose the one with have work experience and average results. Reason being, work experience means that he has done actual work and gained experience from that. Whereas good university results just proves that one is book smart, but he/she might not be necessarily good when it comes to hands on on the actual work. The best situation would be having both good results as well as work experience!0 comments0"
10,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018I will look for people with the right attitude and is willing to learn and make a difference to people around him and to the company. All else are secondary. Would you employ someone who has poor attitude and likes to brag about his/her achievements, despite having fantastic results and many years of work experience? Just wondering. 0 comments0"

12,Nicholas ChanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 18 Sep 2018I would test them during the interview. I've interviewed people with good academics/work experience who can't answer reasonable questions in their field. Background helps for getting the 1st interview. Thereafter it depends on actual ability...0 comments0

MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Attitude plus Experience is important for job skill set tt needs skills.Attitude plus willing to learn is good enough for job tt does not need skills.The school result is a bench mark on how a person learn, rmr and applies so u cannot not take it as a hiring criteria.I will hire the one who can tell me what I can do to help him/her in return and if I feel I can help him/her and he/she can help me.He/she will be hired.Hope this reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/kenichi-xiThank you.0 comments0"
14,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I agree with HC, to me, the most important factor is good attitude.  ​Without good attitude, even with great uni results, the staff may not bother to learn and put in effort to make things work.With some work experience and proven track records, it certainly helps even though the result is average.Bad result may be due to earlier years not keen in studies, etc but that doesn't mean one can't achieve results.  As long as one is willing to learn and put in the effort, he/she will still stand a chance, just that it may seem tougher when competiting with the former 2. However, now many companies tends to give the interviewees to do personality test to find the suitable candidate, so with the correct attitude, one may stands out!​But then, for statutory boards, it may be a different set of benchmark as it is undeniable that they are look into more academic wise.2 comments0"
15,"Leong Wen Fong18 Sep 2018Sometimes good attitude may be hard to discern during interviews though! because the person can put on a show about it, just to get the job!Ck Chai18 Sep 2018Yup, i agree, so some companies will fall back to results, that’s why I say #3 may find it tougher to compete with #1 & #2. But given the chance and with great working attitude & positive mindset, one will gain experience and can have the track record to make himself / herself more competitive 😀"
