1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 20 Aug 2019The main difference is that singles can only buy BTOs at 35.On a side note: Ideally, flat buying should not be one of the key reasons for getting married. Have seen couples marry for the flat, and they divorced before they even moved in. Needless to say, it was not pretty.0 comments1"
2,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 26 Aug 2019Hi Aelbin,Singles can only apply for HDB BTOs at age 35. Getting married would mean that you can BTO early, and staying over at your parents' place whilst saving for the flat is what the majority do. Having children would also mean that the per capita household income is lowered, so a married couple can potentially have more subsidies. Marriage is also a commitment to your significant other too, that you both are in it for the long run. Two people buying a flat goes beyond the dollars and cents.2 comments1"
