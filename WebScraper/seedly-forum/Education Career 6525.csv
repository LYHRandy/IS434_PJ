question,"Education Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Jan 2019I followed my dreams in my career to be a teacher, and now I'm very miserable and unhappy. What should I do from here?I'm suffering from a burnout. I studied computer science in the past, because it was believed to be profitable, but dropped out after one year to pursue my passion: teaching. Now after 5 years in the education sector, I am no longer passionate. I'm tired, but if I got back to CS, it will take another 2-3 years before I graduate. What should I do?7 answersAnswerBump0"

""I think you made the right choice towards teaching.Find out what is burning you out and try to resolve it.Is usually all in your mind.Time vs Money.Unless your next option is really life changing, high chance the profitable dream from CS will not materialise and will make things worst for you.Always embrace what is good around you (teaching is not a bad choice because good students will appreciate you) rather then chasing what you believe is good but in reality, CS is really tough.Hope this helps in anyway.

If you are with MOE perhaps you can finish your bond first, then look into something related to education, like tuition services which is kinda evergreen. Hope this helps 0 comments1"

6,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Jan 2019Burnout can be caused by many reason. Do find out why and find alternative around the cause such as teaching at other places / institutions. You can go try out at international school or even as Private tutor, those have less demands on non teaching task but focus more on teaching and earns more too but with the caveats of like private tutor need to work at night or weekend but weekday day time would be free. A change of environment or ways of work with different demands will put a different perspective and inject fresh new life into your career.Try :) For switching to CS by studying or so, you can if you have the time and can afford the resources especially income.  But do ask yourself what if 5 years later you're also sick about CS jobs ? till then pivot again ?So at the end of the day, is we're able to find a job that meet sufficient needs on income, situations, environment and job satisfactions,we then live with the less than perfect situations. Within these factors, some trade off might be requires in order to get what you wanted. The truth is that we all live with some form of disatisfactions in order to get what we need for our loves one and ourselves.  I suppose that is part of life that we have to learn to deal with. The good thing is, when we felt burn out, a short holiday,  a change of enviroment, a slight deviations without too big of a compromise would still be good. Until we learn better financial planning to budget, save and invest to help ourself with passive income till one day we don't need to work for $ but let $ work for us and we spend our time doing what we like.   Hang out and read up more investment related at Seedly especially their main website: https://blog.seedly.sg/ and other recommended financial bloggers will help us manage our finances better. Hope your find the burn out reason soon and find alternative but still keep the passion of teaching. :)Finally, life is short, go do what you would wanna do after you have done what needs to be done, we can FOMO a little :) All the best!

MasterUpdated on 18 Jan 2019When you are burnt out, you will think anything else is better.My suggestion is to take a small holiday (can be anything off from work, not necessarilyust be going overseas etc). What is the main reason why you love teaching?Find the reason back. Think of whether it's able to be done by alternatives. Not necessarily must be from MOE. Tutoring? Etc? Or even under training and development?I would say to capitliase whatever skills set you have learnt and continue to transfer them to your new job. That would help you to stay competitive in the market with less experience needed.Read also http://limpehft.blogspot.com/ for inspiration.0 comments0"
