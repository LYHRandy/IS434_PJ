After the linkage you can just buy the SSB issue from the bank app/ website/ head down to the atm. When purchasing e.g. $500 do have an extra $2 for the processing fee. So total amount will be $502 when purchasing. :) 0 comments1"

Login to that particular bank's ibanking and you can apply for SSB there. You can take a look at this website: http://www.sgs.gov.sg/savingsbonds/Your-SSB/How-to-buy.aspx0 comments1"
