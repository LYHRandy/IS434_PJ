1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hey there! Although quite uncommon, I have seen cases like this. This is because fundamental analysis traders/value traders alike believe in having a margin of safety when buying stocks. In another words, that means they require a certain % of upside to justify the stock pick in their portfolio. Therefore even if their valuation calculations are slightly off the mark, and assuming the market shares their upside viewpoint albeit to smaller extent, these stocks will help them beat the market index return.As they say in a bull market, every stock is a winner. Therefore in average turbulent times, all the more stock picks matter. Margin of safety is one such measure to make sure you are picking the best out of the bunch.0 comments0"
