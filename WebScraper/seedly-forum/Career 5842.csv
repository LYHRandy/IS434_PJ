question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 05 Jan 2019How to progress in depth for job?I have not completed uni and only have a technical cooking diploma I picked up.After working for a few years in the kitchen, I moved into a sales role for F&B related products but after 4 years in 2 different companies, I felt that I am perhaps not cut out for sales. I fare well enough but do not have the hunger that most who really excel in it do. I'm also tired of chasing for closes monthly and the lack of progression in my career. Am thinking of changing industry/career but dont know how.1 answerAnswerBump0"

Even if you don't fully enjoy the jobscope, you must understand that a job is just a means of income. As long as you don't drag your feet to work, you still can grow and learn to enjoy the little things that you do in work.If you are still into culinary, then then choice is clear- more restaurants/pick up a side project of starting your own food-type business is possible as well.If you think culinary is not your thing, then what else do you plan to learn? What are you studying in your university? Unless you have at least a general direction of what industry or what jobscope you want, it will be hard to give you any advice.Once you select and area you want to go into, the next natural step would be to find resources to study for it. Until then, all the best!0 comments0"
