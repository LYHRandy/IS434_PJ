1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Oct 2018Consider the yield and gearing ratio. Look at the quality of the sponsors, and consistency of the distribution. I personally like Aims Amp and have been invested in it for a number of years. The dpu is quite consistent and their tenants are good. They also do build to suit, which is great. 0 comments1"
