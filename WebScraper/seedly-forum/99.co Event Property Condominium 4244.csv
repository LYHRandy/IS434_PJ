Future Lines""New rail lines have been planned to be built in the next 15 years. These pages will provide a brief overview of the line history and its proposed alignment. The actual alignment of these lines has not been finalised yet.""
The Cross Island Line will be the eighth line to be introduced into the MRT system.Designed to be a fully underground and automated high capacity rapid transit line, it will be Singapore's longest underground MRT line and will span about 50km with around 30 stations across the island.The line will be opening in three stages from 2029, and will enhance east-west travel from Changi to Jurong Industrial Estate; serving as an alternative route for the East West and Downtown Lines.The eastern leg of the line will also extend outwards from Pasir Ris to Punggol.0 comments1"

Just refer to LTA's transport master plan. It's all there. Properties near MRT station are the easiest to rent out. Same for my time when I invested in my first property more than 10 yrs ago. Same today too.​​​
