question,"Investments Bank Account Financial Planners Robo-Advisors Asked by Mike FerrerAsked on 21 Sep 2019Private Banker vs. Fee-only Financial Advisor?Why would an HNWI go with a private bank if they could just go with a fee-only financial advisor like Providend who would be able to do and facilitate all the things and even more? Also, there would be no conflict of interest or upselling of risky products to simply enrich the bank.1 answerAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 21 Sep 2019One of the primary reasons is that through a private banker, you would have access to products more customized to your needs than what the retail market can offer. The retail market, while having quite a number of products, still remains a market that aims to serve the mass market and mass affluent.Examples include special structured products, access to institutional level products, better rates on FD, etc. Also not to mention intangible perks like preferential banking hotline, priority queues, etc. However there are restrictions such as the range of products too, e.g. bancassurance whereby DBS only carries Manulife products, OCBC has GE, etc.In the end, there is no right or wrong, but choose someone you can work with and trust to give the advice that will benefit you.1 comment5"
