Haha I think your question needs abit more description to this... but I think you will find most of your answers here: https://blog.seedly.sg/how-to-sti-etf-a-simple-way-to-invest-in-singapores-top-30-companies/To answer your question specifically, some people choose to do a lump sump investment in the STI ETF at one time. (where they enter the index at a low and ride it as the market goes through the ups and downs)The other way would be via DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) where you invest at a regular interval using the bank's Regular Saving Plan (RSP).I personally have done a mixture of both. And I go into the market when the STI is low. But on a monthly basis i am putting aside a constant sum every month.0 comments1"
