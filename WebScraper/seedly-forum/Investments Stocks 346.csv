1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hi there! You are right in saying that some companies do not want to list on the SGX. However, i think SGX isn't all that bad.There has been a trend of delisting on the SGX. For example, there were 741 listed securities in December 2018, compared to 750 in 2017 and a peak of 782 in 2010. Clearly there has been a clear trend in the increasing frequency of delisting. There are a few reasons that resulted in this:1) Companies find that they are undervalued in SGX due to the illiquid market with thin trading2) Stronger regional competition. For example, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) hsa been competitive grounds as it has benefited from its stock connects to mainland China, increasing volume and liquidity3) Limited by the small pool of domestic firms and investors in Singapore. For example, stocks and securities make up ~10% of local household assets, contributing to the illiquidity in SGX0 comments2"

Grand MasterAnswered 2w agoIt's worse than you probably think.They have external parties who break it down what is wrong currently, give them road maps but they cannot or refuse to adopt.... that sounds like a death knell to meSome famous Singapore companies.Razer IPO-ed in Hongkong.Osim delist from SGX and went ahead to IPO in Hong Kong.Propertyguru going to IPO in Australia.Because of the propertyguru IPO in Australia, someone in media asked SGX abt it, and they were quick to defend themselves. Sounds like Blackberry saying that Blackberry phones are the best.0 comments0"
