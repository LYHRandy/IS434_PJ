1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 16 Jun 2019Consider your expenditure patterns and you might be best served by a mixture of cards for both general and specialized spend. There are a lot of cards on the market, but only the co-brand cards will credit miles directly to your Krisflyer account.Citi PM accumulates citi miles which you need to transfer to Krisflyer before you can start to redeem to flights. Other such cards include DBS altitude, etc where you earn the banks' ""currency"" that will then be converted to miles in the frequent flyer program of your choice.Consider also factors such as earning rate and expiry for the miles. Popular cards include BOC miles card, DBS altitude, Citi Rewards, etc. Happy hunting for the best cards!1 comment8"

3,"Glenn Toh, Founder at Whatcard.sgLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 20 Jun 2019Based on your question description, I assume you are asking for what is the best card to use when booking a Singapore Airlines flight. If you are booking online (directly on singaporeair.com), your best bet is the DBS Womans World Card, Amex Krisflyer/Ascend cards, or the DBS Altitude.
I built a community resource https://www.whatcard.sg/ exactly for this purpose that you can check out if you are wondering which card to use before spending. Took the image below from it (ignore the 4mpd on Citi rewards visa, its an error that I am trying to fix now...)1 comment3"

5,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Jun 2019I am not sure we understand you fully but do you mean that you are looking for a card that gives you miles when booking a ticket with SIA?If yes, consider the UOB Krisflyer credit card that gives you 12,000 miles if you are new to bank and sign up for the card before 30 June 2019. But to claim the 12,000 miles, you have to spend $2,000 within 60 days of opening the card. Link here:https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/krisflyer-uob/credit/Other cards are the AMEX Krisflyer Credit Card and AMEX Krisflyer Ascend Credit Card. Both have sign up bonus if you never hold a AMEX card previously. You can refer to the bonus here:https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/credit-cards/singapore-airlines-krisflyer-credit-card/?linknav=sg-amex-cardshop-details-browse-SingaporeAirlinesKrisflyerCreditCardhttps://www.americanexpress.com/sg/credit-cards/singapore-airlines-krisflyer-ascend-credit-card/?linknav=sg-amex-cardshop-details-browse-SingaporeAirlinesKrisflyerAscendCreditCardThese cards directly credit miles earned from your spending to your Krisflyer account. Hope this helps!0 comments1"
