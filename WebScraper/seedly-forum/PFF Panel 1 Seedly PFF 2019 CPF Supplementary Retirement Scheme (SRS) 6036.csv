Grand MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2019For me, I will prefer SRS.In times of opportunities (or crisis) which happens more often for self-employed than a salaried guy, SRS is still liquid cash (with tax payment).When you need the cash for an opportunity, it is a godsend.PS: I don't even have an SRS, I keep cash in various short term loan and bank accounts for fast usage when needed.0 comments1"
