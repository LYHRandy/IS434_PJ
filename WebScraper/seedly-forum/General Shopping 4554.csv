1,"Ham DominicLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Use Taobao Translate search to translate your item terms instead of Google translate, I find it more accurate, since the most important part of shopping at Taobao is to find the items you want. Or if you need guides to buy from Taobao from set up a Taobao account to handling shipping and communicating with sellers, you can also find words to copy paste from there. Very convenient.1 comment2"

If it doesn't ask you, just right click and select translate. Voila! Taobao in English! :) ​Happy TaoBao (Treasuer Hunt!)​​0 comments0"
