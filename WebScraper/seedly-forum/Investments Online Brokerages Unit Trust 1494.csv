1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Apr 2019Unfortunately there isn't a way to dca automatically into US index ETFs, if that is what you are looking at. You will need to wire the funds in and manually purchase the chosen counter on a periodic basis. Online brokerages wise, you can look at Td Ameritrade or interactive brokers. I'm personally using TD more for options portfolio management though and it's great as there's no live data fees or custodian fees0 comments0"
