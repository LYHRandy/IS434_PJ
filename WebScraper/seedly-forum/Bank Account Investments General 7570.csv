Apart from books, I like to read Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports over the years to understand how they look at being successful in portfolio performance. That said, it's possible to keep reading (and reading) and not action on anything.Which brings me to my second point.Form a conviction in a stock, and make a small position in it.It will:Accelerate your learning curve - because you are putting skin in the game, you are likely to learn all you can about the stock, even though it's your first timeBecause now you have dipped your toes in, the material you read (be it books/annual reports/analyst reports) will be more relevant. You will look for certain data points.You will also learn the emotional aspect of investing. Monitor how you reach when the stock dips/rises. How often do you check on the price? What is your own investment timeline? All these observations about yourself will help you learn.Hope this helps, and all the best!0 comments1"
2,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Yeap you can start with just that amount. Easiest way will be using POSB and robo-advisors. If you want more counters to choose you can try maybank prefunded account(I uses this) or others e.g. Poems, ocbc. 0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Yes it's possible. There are a range of instruments that will take in such amounts. Common ones will be POSB's Invest-Saver where you buy into the STI ETF or a bond fund, Maybank KE's monthly investment programme where you can set a minimum of S$100 to buy into local stocks. Robo advisories like Stashaway (no minimum) and Smartly (minimum S$50) will also fit into this budget. All these are on a monthly basis. ​As you are new to investing, may be a good idea to read up first. Books like Millionaire Teacher (local SG context), Intelligent Investor are great reads. ​Since you are still in uni, perhaps you can see if your school has an investment club that you can join? Best to have a circle of people around you who are also passionate about investing. ​Hope this helps, and all the best. 0 comments1"
4,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey, you definitely can and it's great to start your investment journey early as I believe that it's time in the market is better than timing the market. For fuss free investments, you can consider setting up a Regular Savings Plan with POSB or OCBC to invest in the Nikko AM STI ETF or blue chip shares from as low as $100 a month through dollar cost averaging. If you would like to diversify your investments, you can consider investing through StashAway or Smartly which invests in US ETFs. Based on historical performance, it has better performance as compared to the STI ETF. If you have a bigger risk appetite, you can invest in P2P lending as well, great returns but higher risks as well. Feel free to PM me for a referral link/code if you plan to start investing with Stashaway or Smartly as you'll be able to get a few months of free management fees. 2 comments1"
