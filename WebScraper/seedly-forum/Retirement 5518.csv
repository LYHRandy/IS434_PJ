Topping up to Enhance sum would be the easiest with decent returns and low risk although some might argue that you dont have control and government can change the withdrawal. Its hard to beat the 4% with other less risky investments. You can also consider Robo advisors and can go for the more conservative allocation if you dont want to take too much risk.0 comments0"
