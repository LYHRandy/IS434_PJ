1,"MujimoroLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 26 Jun 2019Getting a loan frees up your cash which you could invest. Housing loan now is 2.5% and there are plenty of investment products out there with higher returns (albeit with some risk). 
Ultimately itâ€™s up to you, but for me, getting a loan and keeping cash for investments (and potentially down payment for other property, car, etc) is the better option.0 comments1"
