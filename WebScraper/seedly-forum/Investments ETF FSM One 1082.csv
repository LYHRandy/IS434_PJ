1,"Roger LengLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 30 May 2019Hi there,I'm Roger from FSMOne.com. Usually, overseas listed ETFs are considered to be listed SIP products. You will need to pass the requirements (either one of investments, educational and working) in order to start investing in listed SIPs without any restriction.For investors who do not meet the requirements for CAR assessment, you will need to acknowledge the potential implications and consequences and subject to an investment limit of S$50,000 (max) on all accounts on FSMOne.com before you can proceed to place online transaction orders.You can find out more about CKA/CAR information from our FAQ. https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/advice-services/faq/121/ Alternatively, you can also contact our friendly client services team (6557 2853) for more information too.Thank you!Roger0 comments1"
