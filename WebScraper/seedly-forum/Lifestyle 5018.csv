1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Dec 2018I would recommend Owndays too. Affordable, quick and hassle free! I've made 2 new pairs of spectacles this year from there, one for casual wear and another for national service. Both still going strong!0 comments0"

4,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I may be abit Mainstream, but I bought my pair of spectacles at OWNDAYS haha. Relatively affordable and can collect in the same day. What's even better is that the specs are pretty hardy also, even though I throw my pair everywhere around, it has not broken in 2 years lol.My next pair, I bought in JB, that one is starting to break and bend under the pressure haha3 comments0"

6,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Haha, you gotta define what ""best pair"" is. In any case, be it specs or sunglasses, I always recommend Kwong Shin at Bras Basah. They've got really good prices and very helpful staff!1 comment0"
