WizardAnswered on 16 May 2019As with most things, it's always a worthwhile endeavour to know what you are getting into.This is especially so when different robo-advisors have different approaches and strategies - their investment decisions and portfolio rebalancing proposals are based on their own algorithms which monitor and satisfy different pre-defined investment strategies. Understand their approach - this is especially important when it goes in the red.As a general rule of thumb, it's good to also study individual stocks, and understand the various methodologies used to evaluate them. For all you know, you might want to be directly investing into your own selected stocks in the future.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Mar 2019In any field of work you end up outsourcing, it's good to know enough to supervise so you don't get ripped off.Same when hiring a domestic helper, or for a business owner hiring an external accounting or HR firm. It may not be your job to know 100% or maybe you're not even interested to manage fully, but know enough to supervise so you understand at least what's going on. If not, 1 year of bad performance and you pull out, realizing your losses and wouldn't come back to investing again.0 comments1"
3,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Mar 2019You still need to know what you are getting into. People think robo advisors are the easy way out. Just put in money and magically you get high returns. But 1 year in, some robos are in negative territory, people who do not know well the investment philosphy or aligned with long term investing strategy start questioning the robos and pulling out. At the very least, learn about ETFs and ETF portfolios. Then when you are able to align your investment philosophy and long term goals with the robo, you will not panic when the portfolio is in the red few months after investing.0 comments0"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Why not learn more about investing? You should definitely consider, as DIY investing  may potentially trump robo advisories (especially dbs', since it's just a basket of unit trusts) over time. Try asking a robo advisory firm to give you 60%pa, year on year, and see what they say. This is the minimum roi I expect  from the income ceiling portfolio I'm running on my own.0 comments0"
