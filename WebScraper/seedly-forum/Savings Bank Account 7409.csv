Grand MasterAnswered on 26 May 2019You can keep your emergency fund in a instrument that has high liquidity and very low risk. I keep mine in CIMB that gives 1 to 1.5% simple and “hassle-free”0 comments4"

If you want something that makes it inconvenient for you to withdraw, try CIMB. After all, I do believe their bank branches are only at Raffles Place or Orchard!Makes you think twice before withdrawing money ;)0 comments3"
