1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Apr 2019Fit is always more important than brand. If you are required to dress in a full suit, as I was required to in my first job, go for tailored clothing. If it's too expensive in SG, take that budget flight out to Vietnam and get it made there!0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 20 Nov 2018If G2000 is not good enough, you could consider asking for a 1-time allowance to buy set of formal wear from the cheapest place your boss has recommended. Get his endorsement of your selection first!I suggest this because I’ve worked at a place where customer service staff were required to wear tailored “uniforms”, and they would get an allowance for it.If your request is denied, you could invest in a good jacket first (from one of the recommended places). A good jacket lasts a long, long time and can play up everything else you’re wearing. You can save on the shirts.0 comments0"

It is their outlet shop so prices are more friendly.But it also depends if your 'figure' can fit those off the racks kind of clothing.For Tailors, if you prefer a cheaper alternative, you can consider heading to Seah Im Food Centre at Harbourfront.

You can even tailor-made them to look flashy and stylish.For me, I look for G2000 (affordable brands) as it is easier to find. Departmental stores have AllanBroke or some other brands which are more economical compared to Armani. i hope the rest have some neighbourhood tailors which you can consider.2 comments0"
