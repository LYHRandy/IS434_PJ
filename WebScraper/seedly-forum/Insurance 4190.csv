1,"GTGabriel Tan Jun WeiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 May 2018Hi there! ​In my personal opinion, MSL was launched to assist with low-income citizens. If you take a look at the benefits under MSL, you would realise that the claim limits are severely insufficient for someone who is earning a decent income.​If you earn a decent income, go get an integrated shield plan because to be honest, for anyone with a decent income, it's very affordable.​Hope I've helped!0 comments1"

MediShield Life has limitation on how much you can claim from your Medisave (provided that you Medisave has enough funds). You can view the limits here. Do note that they are only looking at Class B2/C wards.If you are looking for coverage for ward B1 and above, it is best if you add on an Integrated Shield Plan, that will cover ~80% of the hospital bill. A few possible ISP (Premiums are in the same ascending order too) : Public Hospital Class B1 and belowPublic Hospital Class A and belowPrivate Hospital in a Standard RoomIf you are looking at Integrated Shield Plans, there are riders for you to add on to increase your coverage but that is all up to you because it do incur additional cost from your pockets. 0 comments1"

Medishield also covers class A and private but you will have to top up the difference because the benefits of Medishield coverage is calculated based on Class B/C wards.​However, if you want more coverage up to private, Class A wards, then Integrated shield plans. Most integrated plans will cover till 80-90% of the costs. 0 comments0"
