question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 25 Aug 2019Advice needed on dealing with workplace grievances?How would you deal if an older colleague ridicules you in front of many colleagues (high to low rank) out of a sudden? A harmless question was asked to gain insights during a sharing session but instead of constructive feedback and suggestions, you were being ridiculed and embarrassed, with self-esteem and professional reputation damaged. In Asian’s culture, people will just tell you to move on and let go. How can you stand up for yourself? Without looking being petty about the situation.3 answersAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterAnswered on 28 Aug 2019Live and let go.No one in their deathbeds ever wished they had spent more time at work....So if there is anything bad at work, just smile and let it go, don't let it affect your life. =)If someone takes effort to laugh at you, screw it. Ignore them.If it really affects you, then report to a manager and let the person know this is not a small issue. I am sure there will always be people who do not understand and think that you are kicking up a big fuss but ignore them too!0 comments4"

GeniusUpdated on 28 Aug 2019Report it to your manager first.Then if the manager does not assist or log a case for you then report it to HR.If the staff in your company is not able to resolve it for you then the worst case is going to MOM.Do note that you will need supporting evidence and proof to justify it.0 comments0
