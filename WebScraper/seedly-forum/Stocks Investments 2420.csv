However never buy in simply because of their recommendations- do your own due diligence and ideally your own DCF(if you are fundamental analysis investor)That is why equity research analysts can come up with vastly different recommendations with the same knowledge- buy/sell/hold. The publishing of these Equity Reports from large investment firms and banks often have hidden agendas as they/their big clients hold these individual stocks in their portfolios and thus have an incentive to promote and convince general market sentiment towards their position.0 comments0
