question,"Brokerages Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Mar 2019What is the best brokerage account for small trades (<$10000 at a time)?Decided to take small steps and invest 12k of my savings (will have about $5000 on cash for liquidity purposes). Was thinking of putting about 70% of it into shares because I'm quite young- higher risk appetite in a way. As such, won't be making a high amount of trades- probably looking to buy about 4k of Nikko STI ETF, and split the 8k amongst 4-6 companies in Singapore (advice on that would be useful but not the main focus). What account has smallest fees? Was thinking Saxo/DBS Vickers?1 answerAnswerBump0"
