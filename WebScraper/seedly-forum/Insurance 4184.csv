1,Brandan ChenLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I have a template to share but unfortunately it cannot be sent across by leaving an email as Seedly moderators see it as a form of lead generation.Do speak to your financial advisor on this and let him/her provide you with an overview of your insurance policies. Do categorise your policies by the different types of coverage and premiums paid and key points such as the cash value of the policies (where applicable). Do also put in the policy number got easy reference1 comment2
2,"Kenneth Lou18 Jun 2018Apologies for the misunderstanding! As shared personally, our mod team are still working out the guidelines for emails. We have had a bad history where some people were spamming other users due to leads for insurance sales. We'll figure something out soon. Cheers!

3,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Jun 2018Hmm! Actually from what Brandan shared below, actually our moderation team doesn't mind insurance agents sharing their email for contact :) ​But it's more of providing some value to the person to ask first! And help you understand roughly what makes up the insurance consolidation before linking it!​Or, you could also use an app like PolicyPal to aggregate all your policies together i guess!0 comments1"
