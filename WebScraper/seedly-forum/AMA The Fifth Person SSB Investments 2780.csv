3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019Hello! Here are some benefits of the SSB. Firstly, you will not inflict a penalty for early redemption. There is no penalty for getting back your investments, your investment can be redeemed within one month of application. Next, it is fully backed by the government, thus the risks are very low. SSB is one of the safest product in the market. Also,  a large capital is not needed in order to invest in SSB. The minimum investment is $500, making it rather affordable. Hope these helps! 0 comments1"
