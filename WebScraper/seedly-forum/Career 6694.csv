1,"Constance HoLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 11 Aug 2018Jumping in with a HR perspective!It used to be that at least 2-3 years in a job was the expectation; nowadays job-hopping is not uncommon.However, any tenure less than 6 months will likely not be taken seriously (competitive disadvantage).​A few questions to ask yourself when you're considering a job-hop:1) What have you achieved/learned so far with your current employer? Make a list. Do you like what you see?2) What have you done to take on more responsibilities, if you feel you're not progressing fast enough?- I like to ask this question in interviews because it tests for proactiveness to ""be the change"" and also importantly, grit.3) What is your end goal (if you don't know, no worries - just keep coming back to this question at various stages of your career)? What matters most to you and what are you willing to sacrifice to achieve it?​Conversely, I would advise you not to get too comfortable within a specific environment (company/team/manager) for too long at the beginning of your career, otherwise your ability to adapt may suffer. 0 comments2"
2,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Jul 2018Depends on how in demand you are.​If you are really in demand by employers, job hopping can really increase your income alot. I got a friend who job hopped all the way till 150k a year from a fresh grad.​But I cant do the same as him as my skillsets are less in demand.0 comments2"
3,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Jul 2018For first job I recommend to stay 3-4 years. If you stay only for one year in your next job hop, it will not look good in your resume. Of course need to consider career progression, pay progression, what's your boss view in your career development before making the jump. 0 comments0"
4,Jeff YeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Jul 2018for Your first job I would recommend staying at least for At least 2-3 years before moving. It is ok to accept lower pay for better exp.​From there you can job hop to increase your pay but you also need to understand what skills you can gain from the jump ​Every move you make should help you in the future. ​on the flip side if you find a good boss that takes care of you and moves you up within the company then you should consider staying to get a more senior level.0 comments0
