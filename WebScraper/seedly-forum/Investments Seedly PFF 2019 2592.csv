question,"Investments Seedly PFF 2019 Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Feb 2019How do you find the balance between choosing investment products which may be risky but gives good returns and some which may not ? As much as we want to get back as much capital gain from our investments, we cannot just allocate all our money into high risk investments and expect everything to go smoothly. how then shall we allocate our money, more towards high risk or low risk investment products?1 answerAnswerBump0"

One easy way is to have the % of bonds in your portfolio to match your age, rounded off to the nearest 5. So if you're 25 years old and investing for retirement, you should have a 75% Equity, 25% bond portfolio. Adjust every 5 years as you want more capital protection as you're closer to retirement.0 comments0"
