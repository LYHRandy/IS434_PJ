1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I sometimes do a OMAD (One Meal a Day) challenge - it's awesome because even if I have a $10 dinner inclusive of drinks, my daily meal expense is $10!Of course it doesn't make sense to overdo it - you could lose alot of weight doing this while working out, but it could wreak havoc on your hormornes and general health if you are constantly eating very little.0 comments1"

5,"See all 3 comments Michelle Ho22 Nov 2018I ever spend $30-$40/week for food. That's for cooking at home, meal prep 3 meals plus snacks. That's $120-$160/month. If eat outside, $3.50 cai fan plus $1.50 drink=$5.00/meal. 2 meals outside plus 1 breakfast at home ( usually bread = $2.10+$4.50(spread)) that's bout $10+/day. Times 30 days will be about $300-$350/month. Electricity and gas didn't shoot up during that month. So utility bills was normal.  Of course, have to based on individual appetite, what kind of food they willing to eat and many other factors. Tee-Ming Chew22 Nov 2018Very interesting haha. Thanks for the detailed breakdown!

7,"Heng Kai Le, Mondomover at School Of LifeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019Read more. Reading is the cheapest form of entertainment and enlightenment. Frame it as how it costs you nothing for the period of time you are consuming a book.To motivate yourself further, post your book review on FB or IG to share your good reads with your friends and associates. I do this, and am always pleasantly surprised at how a particular book review resonates with a Friend.Bonus: You will grow in confidence at your expanding encyclopedic knowledge!0 comments0"
