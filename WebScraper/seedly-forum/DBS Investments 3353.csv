I've also seen people invest out of convenience alone, like in the STI where they've given up their monthly payment plans halfway when they don't get or understand the results they're getting. It's a phenomena developing recently, which I've written over here: https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/​Before you start investing, you have to consider your objectives.​Many people don't plan, and become resentful later as a result. If their investments are liquid, they'll have many excuses to take them out. Their returns and their capital becomes abysmal over time, instead of high.​For first timers, I'd love to take you through a good mix with dividends - so you can see how profits are generated from actual companies you're invested in, and be motivated by the balanced growth before deciding what kind of investment result you want to aim for in line with you objectives.​Do drop me a PM and we can always talk about how I can help you. As an investment specialist, I made 32.7% last year. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
