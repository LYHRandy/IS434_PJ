God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Mar 2019Financial analysts don't sell funds or help retail investors invest. They study markets, business performance, opportunities, and more.If you're talking about financial advisors, the Discretionary Portfolio Management Solutions we have today such as Robo Advisors actually make our job easier. I'm an IFA that distribute both Robo solutions and have my own portfolios that I manage.We usually don't provide advice on very short term trading. We may hold tactical fund positions that usually are held for a few months to a year that are triggered on global events and opportunities spotted in the world.But at the end of the day financial advisors still are needed to make sure people understand what they're investing in, help them enter the market with confidence, and convince them to stay in the market even when it's bad.0 comments1"
