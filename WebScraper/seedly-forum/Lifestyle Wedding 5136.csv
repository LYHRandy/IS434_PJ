1,"Kok KoonLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 01 Aug 2018We budgeted $60-$70k to bankroll the wedding. Another amount for housing and reno on the same year - so it was quite intense. Planning ahead makes quite a bit of difference: Deals hunt:Proposal ring, bought from Kim Seng at Lower Delta - no shopfront. Saved 20% for similar cut/carat/whatver Cs vs shopping in the malls. Savings went to wedding bands.Pre+Actual day Photography and videography from JB - 3 days in total, unlimited digital photos (changed album to additional frames): Under $4k. Thanks wife.Gown (2 MTM) + Jacket (including father + brothers) rental: $2k. Thanks wife.Got a great deal for dinner at Orchard Central on a Sunday night at a Saturday lunch price. About 15% savings: this is the most major (pardon the bad england) savings and gave us the biggest buffer. Thanks wife!Financing hacksUOB One Card + SC's Manhatten cashback for banquet monthly installment. 3-5%. UOB card alone got us 2 free tables (out of 40 tables).Staggered FDs expiring. Up to 12 months before, I had 3 tranches of FDs expiring in 12, 6 and 3 months to pay for wedding and reno. This lets you keep the FD to gain the full interest instead of breaking one big FD up and lose interest for the entire amount (modified strategy from ASSI). DIYs + Family & FriendsWe accepted any help offered to us especially from friends who really wanted to contributed to parts of our celebrations. We saved on flora decors and car as they were offered. Savings: Hundreds. Thanks wife!Invite design (Canva- beautiful & FREE) + Postcard Invite Print (Gogoprint - $65)Fake flowers and photobooth stand from taobao. We saved hundreds vs buying fresh flowers and paid it forward to other couples and the flowers have now graced 3 other weddings. Likely 2 more to go. Talk about major ROI.Guest list control + remindersHotels has 1-2 table buffers in case you don't need all to open up. We save exactly the 2 standby tables as we kept the guest list very tight. This was where my hobby skills came to good use:
i. Create a website for RSVP collecting mobile numbers (got photos, our story and an opt-in if they want to receive hard copy). We said save the trees and it saved us some printing costs from here. But some folks still like printed invites so make sure you still budget a bit there. The hosting, templates costs less than $100. I created separate pages for church-only, dinner-only and church+dinner guest pages for us and our parents to send to their invitees. 
ii. Use a bulk sms service to remind guests. Google local service providers and write in to them. They usually sell in bulk, like $500 for 10,000 sms credits. But I wrote in and got a congratulatory reply from the CEO and got a special deal - they let me buy 1000 smses for $50. 1000 was about enough to send one confirmation with details sms and one reminder sms two weeks prior. I believe this was the best $50 spent on the wedding cos it reduced the last min no-show by quite a lot. PM me if you want the email templatePsychological defence
a. As a Seedly-principled member prior to joining the FB group, I was (still am) adverse to spending on something that has no practical returns and we weren't expecting any financial help from parents while we were planning it. If I had it my way, the wedding should have cost less than $5000. But I'm not the only party involved. Marriage is 2 families coming together.Our decision was based on honouring our parents. One of my friend rightly reminded me that we didn't have any excuse not to do it, it wasn't as if we were struggling. He also said that in his experience, the parents and relatives will remember what we did and didn't do for our wedding. And you'd be sure you get reminded every festivities. I took his advice to heart.b. Another friend said, whatever your budget is, assume you can only recover 50%. Anything else treat it like a bonus. c. Also, prepare for budget overblown. This helps tremendously psychologically as we did blow the budget by about 10% - something you must factor in your planning.Epilogue:
We are glad to say we more than recovered the amount spent. So it FELT like a windfall. XD We are also glad we did what we did as some of our guests still come up to us and told us how meaningful the wedding was months down the road when we met at work at homes. Everyone's financial, family and 'face' situation is different but remember, wedding is a day and marriage is a lifetime. Seedly focuses on finances but it's just one-dimension. Work on the budget you set aside and focus on WHY you want to do the wedding. Focus on the people you want to create the experience for. Memories don't need to be extravagant. They need to be thoughtful and meaning 0 comments8"
2,"Constance GohLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Budget depends on both sides parents mainly, and also you and your partner. If can forgo hotel, the most budget you can go for Actual Day is do a solemnisation, and then buffet. But the cons is you can't assume how much angpow you'll get because (to me) it's just a buffet after all. We're planning roughly $30k all in, inclusive of photoshoot, videography, gown rental, SDJ etc. Proposal, a basis lab grown diamond ring is only a few hundreds! Nothing more than $400. You want flowers, get dried flowers lah, cheaper, small one less than $40. You want balloons, get from taobao, fill the helium at other shops. 1 comment1"

4,"Steph YeoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 31 Jul 2018There's no model answer to how much you should budget. Best to discuss with your partner and her family, as well as your own family. (I'm assuming you're a guy because usually guys plan the proposal.)For the proposal, know your girlfriend's expectation of the ring. What kind of rock, how big etc. Also know if she wants a public shebang, cosy session w friends/ family, or just a private thing between the 2 of you. Having these answers will likely give you a sense of your budget.Similarly for the wedding, talk thru your preferences and discuss with parents/relatives of both sides if needed. Very likely you'll have to make compromises to account for views of the family. One thing I've learnt from planning my own is to be very firm on the non-negotiables, but this is a power that you can wield only if you're paying fully for your own wedding. If you're gonna accept funding from parents then be prepared to have things more their way. Bottom line: don't let budget restrict these big once-in-a-lifetime events. Talk it out and try to please all/most of the ppl involved. All the best!0 comments1"

6,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Jul 2018This is a really tough one... There really is no right or wrong, and I think also really highly subjective as well. So I will share from my own experience instead :) I will only share the part on engagement rings cos I haven't reach my wedding part yet. But I think by then you should discuss with your other half definitely.​When I was proposing as well, 1 year ago, I was frantic as hell and of course, turning to Google for advice! I was crawling through 50 odd pages of HWZ trying to find the best advice and digging up relevant content. At the end of the day with different factions arguing on this topic, I was still quite lost. Here’s my take on it, enjoy!​Decide if your partner really wants a Diamond ring (which is the most common type of proposal ring that most people buy) haha. Cos it's mainstream. If not you can try looking for your partner's birth stone. Some people would rather you buy them a STI ETF (investment) as an engagement present, but that's their choice. You can refer to this picture here if you are into birth stones lol:​Next, I will go into the tips and tricks.​3 Key takeaways and truths:Know that the value is not monetary (I strongly believe this. It’s so much more, as some people say, a proposal and a wedding may be one day, but a marriage is a lifetime!)There are NO BENCHMARKS (Especially in corporate, there are rumors floating on the 2-3x monthly salary rule. Don’t be pressured)Look out for the marketing and upselling (You will feel the pressure. Because most sale agents will tell you this: “Diamond Quality = Price = How much you value your other half”)​Stage 1: Online Learning (HWZ, Youtube etc.)You should definitely read up on the 4Cs (Carat, Clarity, Cut, Colour)You will end up seeing a ton of annoying Facebook/Instagram ads on your news feedGet her ring size (Quite easy and can ask a sibling. Usually, they will know, or they can find an accessory she has. Not so crucial because you can resize it later)At this stage, you should probably start getting a benchmark using online ring sites such as Blue Nile, and Fonder Diamond to get what Carat you intend to get, but don’t buy yetStage 2: Ring shopping day (Usually at Orchard Road) – Deposit $500+You can set up an appointment or not. Usually, they will serve you either way.I decided to go alone, as I didn’t want to get pressured by any peers. Remember, stick to your budget.The agents will get your budget, e.g. $3k, and they will start to play with you mentally. He will start to bring out the various scopes, and give you a ring that costs $3k, $4k, $5k And you decide. (so you have to stay firm)The funny thing is, that he/she will ask you if you can tell the difference between the stones, and after a long diamond education on good and bad ones, you feel pressured to know which is the best! But I still got it wrong LOLDeposit ($300-500, depending on how expensive) for them to set the diamond in the band most likely abroadStage 3: Collection day – Full $3k+Hopefully, by this stage, usually 20-30 days away, you have a cash back, miles, rebates card ready (I used the CITI miles card for miles)And today is the day you pay in full and feel a big hole in your pocket, ensure they give you a variety of boxes (I got 3)Get ready to tear up a little and wonder: “How the hell something so small cost so much”Stage 4: Proposal dayDepends on how you plan it, hopefully, it goes well for you!Personally, when I saw the diamond glitter in the sunlight and putting it on for her, it was a warm feeling!It was really worth it in my opinion (but again differs from individual to individual)Conclusion: Buying a Diamond is 90% Marketing​When you go through the process above, you will soon start to realize that it is truly an art of marketing. It is a commonly known fact that your ring depreciates in 50% of the value the moment you leave the shop, but people still buy them. So, if you are already thinking of getting it, hopefully, you can learn some quick tips on how to accelerate and always look for the different options available to you. Ciao!​​0 comments1"
7,"Jasmine TsoiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 15 Sep 2018For wedding: I think this really depends on how much you are comfortable with parting with, and what your partner's/families expectations are. Also, whether you are looking at alternative venues or hotel banquets.. alternative venues might be slightly cheaper at around $100/pax as you just need to rent the place & get catering in, however you might also run the risk of not being able to recover the costs as people might see it as a casual event. BUT, nowadays there seems to be more alternative venues in the market and they are quite ex!! I think one tip is to go for weddings fairs or shows and learn to negotiate your package for extra inclusions! Dayrebrides is a great community where people share info and tips as well :) 0 comments0"
8,"Jay Liu, Diploma in Accountancy  at KHEALevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Will you want to splurge on wedding dinner or do you want to spend it more on reno/bigger flat. Rather have a simple buffet though the older generations will be judgemental. 0 comments0"
9,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 30 Jul 2018Can get hint from your girlfriend on whether proposal is something she expects. Personally, I don't so we didn't spend money on proposal.For wedding, we did small one within our means. Budgeted S$25k for wedding bands, banquet and photoshoot more than 5 years back. You may want to budget for honeymoon also which I find more meaningful :) 0 comments0"
