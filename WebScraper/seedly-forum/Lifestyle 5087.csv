question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Nov 2018I am almost 40 and still in debt. I had a business that went quite badly and I am left with 100k to clear. I can't get a well paying job due to lack of qualifications. Where I can go for some help?I do have a business that is doing very minimally but it's just enough to feed me. I would like a house and some freedom from this as I've been struggling a long time and not from laziness or lack of trying.. At my age, do you feel it's too late for me to build some real wealth in life?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Tiffany SQLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey there.. totally understand ur frustration.. I reckon u still can bounce back up.. but it takes discipline and determination.. I am gonna write a few pointers and hope it helps:1) Clearing Debt
You can try visiting debt management programme to see how can they help u out.. to know what r some of the options u can look into to slowly clear ur debt.. an example of such site will be https://www.ccs.org.sg 2) Knowing what is your strength and skill set
Not all jobs require high qualification.. sit and and draft out what kind of skills set u have.. e.g. driving, design, sales, etc.. from there explore the possible jobs opportunities u have.. for example if u have a driving licence and is gd in sales.. U may want to drive Grab and do a sales job at the same time to generate your income3) You Current Biz
Let be pratical.. not all biz r profitable.. U need to measure the time and effort spend on it vs the earnings u will get.. if the biz is only paying u 1.5k per month.. driving full time may let u be better off than that.
4) Consolidating everything
Once u have map out all the possible income u can get, start taking action and slowly clear off your debts.. it may take a few years but at least u r doing smt about it..Hope this helps alittle.. U may also talk to the bank to see how they can help u to refinance ur debts or get a better interest rate too..All the best ðŸ˜„2 comments3"
