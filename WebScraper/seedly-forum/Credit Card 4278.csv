You can read the experience of Sarra Vanan here.He has also detailed his experience of optimising with the SCB Bonus Saver account! If you need to get a SCB Unlimited card, I would recommend a SCB Unlimited cashback card if you are looking to use a SCB card together with your SCB account. You can check it out here :https://seedly.sg/reviews/credit-cards/scb-unlimited-cashbackIf you are looking for a solid cashback card, then maybe a BOC Family Card, but the min spend is $800. I'm personally using this now! https://seedly.sg/reviews/credit-cards/bankofchina-family-cashback0 comments0"
