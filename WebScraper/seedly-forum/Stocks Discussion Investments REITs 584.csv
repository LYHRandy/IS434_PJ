1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 05 Sep 2019REITs can trade below PB for a number of reasons such as cyclical industry, poor management, bad future outlook, economic conditions etc.Ascott is part of the hospitality industry. Perhaps, the tourism industry is experiencing a downturn. Generally, the hospitality industry is a cyclical industry because there are periods of high tourism and low tourism numbers.1 comment1"
