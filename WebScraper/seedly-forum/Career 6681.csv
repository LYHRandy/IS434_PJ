1,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Jul 2018By creating value, you earn money. ​How stupid or lame that sentence it, but it is the ultimate truth. I started working when i was 14 years old, cleaning plates, sweeping floor at a fast food resturant. ​At 18 years old, I think making some money is important, but don't forgo that learning experience academically and also in real life.​In a short answer, I would think making money via a part time job is the most realistic. There are 101 ways of making money, but something safer option would be using your time and some effort/skills to create value, making some money. Focus on learning more academically and also something outside of academic, say learn a sports, learn a language. These are future steps that can bring you further up to earn even more money. ​Money is important, but please never forgo the sights of improving yourself, it is far more important.0 comments2"
2,"Jay LiuLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jul 2018If you're willing to take the risk, you can try e-commerce.  Did that when I was 19.
Order stocks from China e.g. Aliexpress. 
Sell it on platforms e.g. Carousell. 
Learn to do normal/Reg mailing/Smartpac will help you do delivery easier rather than doing meet ups. 0 comments2"

Back then I was entering the NS, so I guess that was working as well.​Anyway, I think there are multiple ways to make money (legally) at your age. Largely centered around part-time jobs and making extra pocket money on the side. Some ideas include:Giving tuition for subjects (o level or a level type) Giving private lessons for skills (eg piano, tennis, instruments etc) I went to get my tennis coach certificate to do thisAssistants at supermarkets (I was a Pokka drink refiller once at some NTUC at 16 years old)Working at F&B outlets, most would allow around $6-7 per hour Other than that, look to get internships that pay around $600 - 700/mth so you earn while you also get experience in the working world. In the long run, aside from doing odd jobs, you'll be able to grow your skillsets and make you more employable when you start working after studying. Next time, your network is your net worth :) Some internships are even part time, so you can work while studying theoretically.​All the best ok! And good to have this hustler mindset, never settle.0 comments2"
4,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Jul 2018It seems your goal is to make more money. Working part time is a good start at your age. Once you complete your studies, you can perhaps start to move towards finding a job that you like.0 comments2"
5,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Jul 2018It's admirable that you are thinking about this at young age. You can consider to give tuitions or working part time e.g data entry in company, or doing translation work etcMy advice is to focus on your studies, when younger I wish to earn money but now I am working I wish I enjoy my younger self more. Earning money can wait (unless you have immediate need for it).Also not only earning money, please cultivate good habit of saving money for rainy days too :) 0 comments1"

When I was your age, I was struggling to get out of bed because I was such a bum. Here is the advice. ​​For starters, do make sure that currently, you can handle both work and studies. At the very least you graduate and have earned a bit money over that few years. Most important is to protect your money, so if there are any get rich quick scheme, avoid them like plague. In the best case scenario, you missed an opportunity. But in the worst case scenario, you would lose whatever money you have, or even worse, owe debts( provided you borrow money to invest). ​​Next, learn to budget. One way is from this community Seedly, which has a guideline where budget is split into 50 - 30 - 20, 50% necessities, 30% wealth and 20% savings. https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-allocate-your-monthly-salary/There are also other guidelines, such as insurance 40-30-20-10. These are merely for references and I would say, adjust them to your situation. The savings components are to build up an emergency funds, which can range anywhere from 3 months to 12 months. ​​Third, once you get a hang of how much you can save, you will need to take care of your insurance. A simple hospitalisation (or more commonly known as integrated shield plan) and a personal accident plan should suffice. Be wary of buying into endowments, ILP, Unit Trusts, etc, where it is of higher cost, as well as long commitment periods (range from 15-25 years). Rationale being you want to be protected, yet at the same time, you would not want to be tied down. It so happens that by this year, it had been 10 years since the last crisis in 2008. Assuming the worst case scenario whereby anytime 1 to 2 years from now, an economic recession happen, you do not want to be burdened unnecessarily. ​​Forth, start to read up on financial books and differentiate the different styles of investing. See which one suits you. If necessary, go for courses preview and decide not on the spot, but later on. At this point in time, it would be difficult to straight away go for most courses. Read up on the macro factors and see how it affect investments. Best example happened recently in Singapore was the announcement of the hike in Additional Buyer Stamp Duty (ABSD), while for overseas, it is the trade war between USA and China. (Donald Trump finalised the details.) See how it affects other people and how would you react? What are the pointers you can come up with?​​Also, I can't believe I'm saying this, but please be patient with yourself. As much as you are filial to your parents, you can't build Rome overnight, just as you can't get a baby in one month by impregnanting 9 women. You are working part time and studying, and I hope you do reward yourself once in a while. Work hard, play hard. Never underestimate the intangible benefits of rewarding yourself once in a while. It recharges you so that you can chiong further. Remember, at the end of the day, money is a means, a tool to life. A healthy life, both mentally and physically, is also important. ​​Anyway, if you feel that you need more clarifications, can always PM me. Especially on the budget and a bit on investment. ​2 comments1"
7,"Lois19 Jul 2018wow, that really helped me alot! thank you so much.. is there any book recommendations for me to read?Rave Ong Ci De20 Jul 2018There are a few books. 

1) Rich Dad, Poor Dad - Robert T. Kiyosaki. 
This one is mainly for his cashflow quadrant. Use this to get an understanding on what would help bring more cash in. 
I liked most of what he says, except when it comes to debt.

8,"ZongzongLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jul 2018Hi 18-year-old anon,​It's really good to know you're thinking for your parents and wanting to support yourself! Very few people of your age will think of supporting themselves and much less their own parents. ​I had the same mindset when I was your age, here are a few things you can do:​1/ Giving Tuition: $15+/hrFor starters and if your academics are okay, tuition is probably the best return of your time. Even if you aren't good in school, you should be able to teach lower secondary or primary school. Primary school tuition range about $15-$25/hr, and lower secondary should be $20-$30/hr.​2/ Buy groceries for honestbee: $10+/hrThere will definitely be a fairprice near where you stay, so you're able to take on the shopper bee role for honestbee and pick up groceries for their customers. This job requires you to have a smartphone and you will always be walking around throughout the day. And, from what I know, you really have to sweat it to earn the dollars, but the job gets easier the more you do because you know where the items are. *You will need to attend the free training courses before starting the job.​I've never done the remaining jobs before, and the inspirations are from TheSmartLocal's article:​3/ Completing Onliny SurveysJust my opinio: the surveys usually get snatched up very fast, and need to complete many of them to earn anything substantial.​4/ PetsittingWow, this sounds damn fun and is something I might want to do myself too! There's the app to register yourself as a pet-walker or pet-sitter. Or you can list your dog-walking service on Carousell too.​5/ Do errands for other peopleOnce I've queued for bakkwa for 6 hours, no joke. If you have some free time and energy, can consider using some of the apps mentioned to run errands for other people.​6/ Grab driver  If you have the money to go learn a driving license, can rent cars to drive Grab part-time. You will need approximately 4 hours a day to cover your rental cost + petrol.0 comments0"
9,"Chris ChinLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Jul 2018Really glad you are aware that you need to invest to get better returns for your hard earned income. 
There is Active and Passive Income that you would have to deal with. 
Passive Income - Invest time and money to get better returns from the least effort. 
Invest in an Investing Course to gain Financial Literacy faster. 
Good to start with investing ETF and Dividend Stocks as a safe financial vehicle at your age. You could move towards Growth Stocks as your get better with your value investing experience. 
Never use Margins (Loans with interest) from your Broker or Bank Loans to do investing,  as you would have trouble focusing on your studies and daily life activities when the market becomes volatile. 
Portfolio management is critical. Never risk more than 10% of your budget in each investment transaction, so that you can have the holding power to continue investing when 1 or 2 investment got stuck. 
Stay away from risky Trading in FOREX,  Futures and Commodities, that could wipe out your entire capital budget when the markets go against your trading position. 
Active Income -  I would advise you to focus more on Active Income and get more Life Challenging experience as a youth. 
Do ensure that these activities do not rob you of precious time to commit to your studies and personal growth. 
There is no absolute right or wrong approach though. 
Be open but selective in what you do, so that you can go deeper in experiential learning rather than being frivolous and superficial in everything you engage in. 
Explore giving Private Tuition, eBay Dropshipping, etc. 
Most importantly is to find a meaningful direction in life to help others. 
Have a great life ahead. 0 comments0"
