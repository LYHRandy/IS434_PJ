2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Mar 2019Hello! Here are some disadvantages of using Net Present Value to measure investments1) NPV is sensitive to discount rates. A small change in the discount rate will have a considerable effect on the final output. 2) Your investment would not have the same level of risk throughout the entire time period. 3) When using NPV as an investment criteria, it excludes all the value of any real options that may exist within the investment.Hope this helps!0 comments0"
