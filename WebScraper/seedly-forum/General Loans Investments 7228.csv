1,"Luke Ho, Venture Capitalist at CFXLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Aug 2018Well...this is what I do. It's one of my only specialties outside of my Financial Advisory business, hence the credentials above. ​I've invested in quite a few SMEs, specificially local ones which have a higher emphasis on E-Commerce (ironically, my tech skills suck big time and I rarely understand the e-process). This is because banks and even kickstarter campaigns/crowdfunding sites tend to be quite unfavorable towards SMEs with very little of their own capital invested. But a good idea is a good idea.​Addressing your question - I've invested in two contact lens companies - where I yielded 17% and 500% respectively before my exit. Of course, each time I only invested $2000 each and quite frankly speaking I had no idea what I was doing at the time, nor did I have a lot of capital, much like you. It could easily have gone badly and my hard earned money post NS would have gone to waste, and I would never have gone on to yield close to 50% in 2017 in one asset class net of fees because I would have given up on investing entirely.​Like the others have said, I would urge you to try investing in public funds, etfs or stocks first to get a feel of it. Lose a little capital, make a ridiculous gain, but see how it makes you feel. Only experience tells you what your risk profile is really like. Personally, since you're young I'd ditch some money in something really aggressive like China and India so you get a feel of what high risk, high return is really like...because thats the kind of return you should expect from investing in SMEs as well. ​It's extremely tricky to invest in such SMEs like I showed in the example above because you have to have a solid business sense. You need to see if the entrepreneur can be trusted, has strong expertise in their field as well as financial expertise...one of the issues I'm seeing today is that most business owners are good at what they do (e.g. baking cakes) but they have no idea how to do sales, how to juggle their accounts - its one thing to have an amazing product and it matters for jack if the person isn't capable of swallowing rejection every day in order to sell it. And unfortunately, most businesses aren't, which is why the majority of them fail.​I would highly advise against it for someone your age unless you have some experience running a business yourself, in which case it would be much easier for you to see if someone is  likely to succeed or fail or not. ​So like I said, try investing in something high risk first to test yourself while you're young - and during the time that passes for your investment to bear fruit or not, learn about the nuances of investing in SMEs. ​I wouldn't mind talking to you further about it as this is one of my passions, and maybe kicking you off your investment journey. You can always drop me a private message if you feel comfortable, and I'd get back to you by  September 1st. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54​​0 comments0"
2,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Aug 2018There is no way to buy shares of companies (MNC or SME) not listed on SGX, since they didn't go through the process of IPO.​I highly recommend you to increase your financial knowledge first through reading, be it blogs or books. Go and understand the different assets class available for investment, understand your risk profile and what is the time frame you are looking at. I may be wrong but from what I see, you are jumping on the investment bandwagon blindly. Do take the down period before ORD to read, ask questions before taking the plunge.​To start you off, things like ETF and Robo advisers are places you can start first, since inital investment is as low as $100/month. Once you gain more knowledge, you can move on to shares and REITS and subsequently, funds.​All the best!0 comments0"
3,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Aug 2018I think investing in SMEs generally is of a higher risk. If you are new to investing, why not try out robo advisors? This way they do the risk assessment for you, and you just have to key in according to the amount you wish to invest and the risk that you want to take. ​That being said, you can use the time to learn more about investments or portfolios.https://seedly.sg/reviews/investment-courses Here's a list of investment courses and their reviews!​Alternatively, if you want to delve more into SMEs, you can go through P2P Lending platformshttps://seedly.sg/reviews/p2p-lending​This helps you reduce the hardwork you need to access each company, and you can invest in more companies than 1, thus also diversifying your portfolio!0 comments0"
4,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Aug 2018By definition, SMEs in Singapore are enterprises that have less than 100M in revenue or employ less than 200 employees.​Such companies may or may not be listed, since majority are small companies or are family owned.​For listed companies, you may find them either on SGX mainboard or Catalist. On the Catalist side, it may not be that easy to find a hidden gem. For this, you need to register for 2 things: CDP account with SGX and a trading account with a broker (I use SCB).​As for non-listed companies, you may negotiate with the owners themselves to see if they are willing to be a sleeping partner. Be sure to get a lawyer if you were to invest in such private deals.​​Back to your profile, it appears that you are new to investing. Instead of rushing in to make investments, perhaps it would be a good time for you to start reading up on investing and gain some knowledge first. Seedly has quite a couple of useful articles that can educate you on how to start your investment journey, so take some time to go through them. Instead of starting with individual stocks, perhaps you can start off with ETFs that suit your risk profile.​​​0 comments0"
