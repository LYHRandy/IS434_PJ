2,"Yeap Ming FengLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 19 May 2018Singaporeans are generally a big fan of property, given the fact that our property market has benefitted a lot of people who invested in one in the past.​With that mentality, investing in property overseas can seem like a pretty good idea. But here's the catch.​Different countries have different demographics and policies when it comes to this. While Singapore is in shortage of land, resulting in land being expensive, we can't say the same for other countries. ​If I'm not wrong, my latest finding is that Malaysia's property market is in a state of oversupply. This means that negotiating power of sellers and renters are dropping.​Next, while some of our condos are well maintained to keep the value high, we can't say the same for the property you might be investing overseas. Also, it will be a chore to constantly check on it.​It will be great to keep a close watch on possible policies revolving around the market and if there's any possible development plans in JB that can help fuel property prices there.​​0 comments0"
