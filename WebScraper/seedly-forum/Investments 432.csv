1,"JJefremy Level 3. WonderkidUpdated 3w agoThanks for bringing the information up. I just sent them a message. I've been burnt before in crypto investments, just cause there's so little information on these managed crypto funds. This platform looks like a scam. Let's take a look at what they offer.1) daily returns from ai algorithm cryptocurrency tradingOnly BTC is alive and well right now is alive, so there can be no other profitable predictable algorithm other than trading BTC2) anonymous accounts?why would you target Singaporeans for anonymous accounts, we don't pay capital gains tax nor personal income tax from crypto3) they never state what currency you receive your daily returns.no clarity on this part makes it a little fishyMy 2 cents, stay away. This looks like a Ponzi. Instead, study and look at nodes; how you can earn daily legitimately and know for sure its not a scam. Managed funds are only good if they are regulated.
Running nodes is not easy, but once you understand and get a hang of it, it can be a source of income.2 comments0"
