1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 09 Oct 2018Wow! Congratulations for your new Home! :)​​​On top of Kenneth's ROT, I can share a few more: ​Some other suggestions:​(1) Avoid roadshow deals! Exactly! Especially those at Expo! They claim today or this weekend only but in actual fact they take the same booths same or similar show and is always there all the time!!!​(2) Many of the ID tends to use the similar sales technique, gives you pressure telling you the special deal / offers is now only or these 2 day only! Don't believe them! Avoid those ID company at all cost! They are those hard up for sales and most of the time either over quote or in-experience.(3) Look at Renotalk to check out reliable reviews, can ask and do poll in FB to ask around.​(4) Make sure that you do not pay the full amount, but staggered based on completion progress. Ensure it is at least 5 to 6 phases of payment, define your own phase. Eg:i) Start work - 5% paymentii) Phase 1 complete (At least total 30% of the work) - 10% paymentiii) Phase 2 complete (At least total 50% of the work) - 25% paymentiv) Phase 3 complete (at least total 70% of the work - 30% paymentv) Final Phase(Balance 30% After all complete, ensure they fix all the major / minor defect you've checked and feedback)​* The Final phase is especially important because 30% is a sizable sum, this will ensure those who never complete their work properly will not run away but Guai Guai complete and fix all the defect.​(5) My friend shared with me her story whereby their ID/contractor run away because her father paid upfront 100% in the beginning and they just go MIA and disappear. So always negotiate about payment schedule with ID / Contractor upfront, ask them to modify their agreement when you want to use their services. Having this agreement contract modify to some of your terms is also to protect your interest such that it is not one sided. In case of dispute you can use the contract against the ID / contractor.​​​​0 comments2"
2,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 09 Oct 2018I think referrals work best really! Personally, we got a referral through my sister in law family and it worked really well. We got this company which was a 2-3 man show and they were fast, responsive and responsible.​Some rule of thumbs:Avoid roadshow deals, most of the time the scams come from over-promises and under deliveryLook at Renopedia or their facebook page and Qanvast to read reviews on their ID work so farJust do a simple google search to crawl through forum sites (eg HWZ) to determine if you can trust this company you may be consideringGet at least 3 companies to quote you to check line items to see if it makes sense or which one are over-charged.Make sure that you do not pay the full amount, but stagger based on completion progressFor the last cheque, also ensure that you do not pay upfront. Check if your home is in living condition and check for minor defects before asking for fixes. Only then do you hand over your cheque. Yup that's based on experience so far, like shared, I think the best kind are the ones where they detail out a clear plan, even giving you a calender on which day is doing what (eg lighting, carpentry etc) so you are also involved in the process.0 comments2"
3,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 09 Oct 2018Tips are aplenty, it rly depends on what you think is important. I just signed up with Renopedia and they sent me these 5 tips: 
1) Look for Interior Designers that can do
3D walkthrough of your home before the actual renovation 
2) Look for an interior designer that ensures after sales service
3) Check what kind of contractors the Interior Designer is working with, and how long they’ve been partnered for (hints at the ID's work ethic too)
4) Any interior designer that tells you that they can do all kinds of homes (HDB, condo, landed) is probably not really telling the truth. If you are staying in a HDB, look for an interior designer that is willing to admit that 
they are more experienced in HDBs.
5) A good interior designer will 
plan out the entire process for you on a day-by-day basis (for accountability)0 comments1"

Reviews by others on the quality of work from past projects.​SMRT Feedback by The Vigilanteh facebook group has a list of blacklisted renovation companies. You may wanna start from there and avoid those on this list0 comments0"
