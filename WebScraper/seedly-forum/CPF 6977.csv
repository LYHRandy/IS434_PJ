1,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019No straightforward answers here.I will advise to top up MA/SA to enjoy tax relief if the following are met (But not limited to):1) You will confirm + chop reach FRS at 55 years old, with the projected increment of the minimum sum.2) You enjoy a ""good"" tax rebate, meaning your income is on a higher tier tax bracket and not the 1st/2nd bracket for instance 3) You do not need the cash until you reach 55 years old (With assumption #1 is met). You should have reserve monies from other places.4) If liquid monies is important to you, can consider SRS. At least can withdraw at a penalty for early withdrawals subjected to 100% tax for that year.1 comment1"
