A quick Google search shows it has very little volume and is only trading on 2 exchanges: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/infireum/trading_exchanges#panelAlso, there's not much info, updates or announcements from the official channels of the team:https://infireum.com/https://medium.com/@infireumglobalhttps://twitter.com/infireumI can't find a whitepaper or description of the technology they use for their coin or blockchain.
