God of WisdomAnswered on 05 Apr 2019You need compounded growth over a long term to grow your wealth.Using high interest savings account, CPF, endowment plans are safe ways to find compounded growth with minimal risk. If you'd like to start investing, you should start by opening a managed global portfolio either set up by a Financial Advisor or a Robo Advisor.As long as you stay invested, your money will quickly compound and your 20k will start doubling every 10 years or so.0 comments0"
