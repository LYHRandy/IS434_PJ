1,"Kishor BhagwatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Mar 2019They are apples and oranges. TIPS will perform well when inflation goes up, which is exactly when Treasury bond prices go down. They complement each other in a portfolio. Please remember that the market is not the economy. Market prices reflect expectations, and they are wrong a lot of times.0 comments1"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 27 Mar 2019I wouldn't particularly say that U.S TIPS Bonds ETF are better than SG Bond ETFs per se. This is determined by your forecast of future inflation rates of US. If let's say for example, you expect inflation rates to be rising in the US, you would thus expect the price of TIPs to be increasing because there is greater demand for such US TIPs in order to hedge against the inflation. As for SG Gov Bond ETF, that would be determined by the performance of the Singapore economy, Singapore's interest rate fluctuations and general demand of the bonds.If you want to talk about raw data - US TIPS Bond ETFS have a general YTD of about ~3.14% currently - quite respectable given the dovish turn that the Fed has taken currently, holding onto the current fed fund rate. So, we may not be looking at any interest hikes in the near future, meaning inflation is not a concern for them currently. This may not bode well for future performances of TIPs in this case as investors may not choose to purchase TIPS but instead put money into pure Treasury bonds, reducing prices of the TIPS. The info I obtained is from ETFdb.com, at this link https://etfdb.com/etfdb-category/inflation-protected-bonds/If you are looking at SG bonds ETF, their performance is as expected - nothing too exciting, sitting at about 2.78% for the last 3 months (if we are to compared to the YTD performance of US TIPS ETFs, I took this Yield from the ABF bond fund performance https://www.nikkoam.com.sg/etf/abf ) But with the lack of excitment comes a favourable edge - predictability. With the current yield curve inversion scare we had recently, perhaps more people may be rotating into more traditional bonds soon. We may see a rise in demand for our SG bonds given it's safety and AAA ratings, and thus may give rise to higher prices and greater yields for the ETFs.I'm ill equipped to be a proper analyst of what is right or wrong to invest in now, but my opinion is defintely leaning more towards traditional gov bond funds now, not just SG gov bond ETFs. I don't think the yield for TIPs would be exploding given the rather cautious approach that the Fed of US is taking now regarding interest rates, meaning that perhaps the economy isn't exactly doing as good as it should to warrant one. Just my late night thought process at the moment, hope it helps in your own!0 comments1"
