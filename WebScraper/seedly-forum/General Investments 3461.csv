1,"Dwivid SharmaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 27 Aug 2018Hi there,​I am not sure that my opinion will help you. But I want to share my life experience with you.  Getting degree really worthful. Education help our mind to develop. If you want to develop your thinking power you need to get educate a lot. But It is also important, taht the education must be in same field in which you are willing to work in future.​If you don't know, what are your job responsibility regarding the work you want to do in future. Try to ask people who are doing same or try to do internship in it to learn about the job responsibility.​In short try to think your education decision as an investment. How much you are investing? How long it will take to get equivalent returns? What are other opnion for this type of investment.​​​​0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 26 Aug 2018How worthwhile a degree is in monetary terms is subjective and depends on your financial situation. How worthwhile a degree is in the intangible terms like overseas exchange, hall life, CCA experience is also subjective to how much you like stuff like that and how much work you want to put in to commit to these things on top of the regular curriculum. I don't think I'm using much of what i learnt in my uni curriculum at work now, but the truth is that if you have a degree you qualify for more jobs. My uni experience is valuable to me because of the soft skills i learnt while participating in a whole host of CCAs--students union, sports, overseas seminar, orientation activities, part-time student jobs etc. Your uni experience is truly what you make it to be, so if you want your money's worth I'm sure you'll be able to find a way. 0 comments1"

RookieAnswered on 24 Aug 2018Agree with Gabriel that it is more of a safety net, especially in Singapore i guess. ​But I think it's kind of difficult to measure its true ""worth""? I've enjoyed what i've learnt, and beyond earning the degree, i've got to experience hall life. To me, the whole uni experience was fun, interesting and enriching and it's the whole package that makes up its ""worth"" for me. That piece of paper did help me secure a job and determined my starting pay. But would I have been able to find a job without the qualification? I'm pretty sure it's possible. At the end of the day, passion, hard work, and motivation all comes into play. With or without a degree, one could do well as long as one is willing to put in the effort. 0 comments1"

You’ll really have to show how you are different.​It’s no longer about paper qualifications if you want to excel.​focus on:​Building reputationBuilding networksBuilding experience​The paper qualification is only really crucial if you are in large MNCs or government sectors.​Even so, without the 3 things above, your job is not secure. And also may be prone to suffering job cuts during recessions.​0 comments0"
