1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Dec 2018After going through most of this year with getting into icos and other crypto projects, I'll say stay out. A lot of these projects die off with your hard earned cash with it. Only projects you should consider are those that do not hold any of your crypto currencies or money, like those that provide trading signals trading btc and others. Smrt feedback group on Facebook did run a fully insured crypto fund last year but it also died off in a way; good thing it was capital guaranteed and we were able to direct the funds to their other fiat projects. 0 comments0"
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 01 Dec 2018You really need to read up and understand what is the underlying project about. You shouldn't listen to what people say which is 'good'. The due diligence required is much higher than other vehicles. All the crypto projects are in 'conception' phase, in other words, it will probably take another 5-10yrs for the projects to show if they can fulfil what they are intended to do. That said, u can take a look at Tronix, TRX. I find this project promising if it is able to fulfil its vision. For the pricing part (what price to enter), u have to decide for yourself. If u want to invest in whichever project, prepare to hold for the next 5-10yrs, even if the price falls another 50%. If u think such scenario will give u jitters or will think to exit, then 'investing' in crypto is not for u. 0 comments0"
