1,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Take the FRS out of the equation first, because regardless, you're still obligated to pay off the HDB loan.Then consider this:Although SA offers 4% interest rate as compared to the 2.6% interest accruing on your loan of OA may make it sound like a good choice to transfer OA to SA, it's not entirely true.Note that your 2.6% interest accruing on your outstanding loan of 170k would mean that it's a loan interest of $4420 annually.Even if you were to transfer all of your OA (70K) to SA, it will only give you an additional $2800 of interest annually.So ask yourself this, is $4420 of interest accruing on your loan annually more than $2800 of interest that you earn annually?Note that the OA to SA transfer is irreversible. You may end up having to fork out some cash to service your mortgage. Do you want to remain cash-rich or cash-poor? Still need a full understanding of your financial situation before giving a recommendation...4 comments2"
2,"See all 4 comments Yixiong Chang10 Nov 2018I'm not sure what u are talking about. If he chooses to use $70k to pay down the mortgage, he is effectively saving 2.6% on 70k for 16years or less. The loan gets reduced to 100k, and thus the interests on the mortgage applies to the remaining balance gets reduced.  
Whereas the $70k money in the SA will be able to compound for the rest of his life. Jim Ng10 Nov 2018That's right. So if he were to transfer $70k to his SA, effectively there is no money left in his OA right? So will he service his mortgage with cash? is he required to refinance the loan after 16 years with another financial institution? "
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yes, it is a good idea to transfer OA to SA. You will get a 1.4% positive roll on your money. CPF has its own calculator to tell u how much more interest u earn by transferring OA to SA. HDB loan is just 0.1% more so the estimation will not be too far off.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/OAToSATransfer/OAToSATransferBut if you value the peace of mind in paying down your loan faster, just go ahead and use your OA. Have you considered topping up your SA using cash? You will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%% interest yearly guaranteed. Tax relief through this way is capped at $7k. The monthly payout (CPF Life) will payout for the rest of your life. It will not be depleted. Add me on facebook if you would like to discuss further.1 comment0"
4,"Jim Ng10 Nov 2018Yes, there is a 1.4% roll on his money ONLY if the outstanding loan is equiavalent or less than the amount he transfers to his SA. Otherwise, since the interest accruing on the loan is greater than the interest obtained from transferring to SA, there isnâ€™t any real gain at all."
