God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Aug 2019To me, SSBs are an alternative to FDs, without the lock in of a FD, and with a comparable return to boot. Considering the alternative of leaving it in the bank with 0.05% interest, I would park my warchest for investing in several tranches of SSBs and liquidate them when market opportunities present themselves.0 comments3"

If you have DBS multiplier account, it would help to clock your investment component when you receive the interest payout.On a side note: SRS funds can be used to purchase SSB. (Not to yield the Multiplier benefits though)1 comment2"

ProdigyUpdated on 06 Aug 2019Hi there,SRS is for retirement buy SSB is for liquidity (anytime use). Many buy the Singapore Savings Bond for that reason only but at current rate of 1.6+% for the coming few years, it's not too ideal at current moment.If you would like to find out more on SSB, I've created this formula which is the WAG formula to help you understand it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDL88ewqSnM&0 comments1"
5,"Siow Nan, Electrical And Computer Engineering at NusLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Aug 2019Putting in srs is not useful if you are not putting it to other investments as the interest rates are the minimal bank rates at the moment.
So some uses the srs amount to purchase low risk products like ssb to also gain some interest revenue. Recently the rates are on the low side for ssb though but still some prefer it as a low risk bond portfolio0 comments1"

The idea is that if SSB GG then Singapore also GG.SRS can invest into SSB too.It's better than sittting in your 0.5% interest bank account.Do note that redemption takes about 1 month though, so don't pour all your emergency funds into it.0 comments0"
