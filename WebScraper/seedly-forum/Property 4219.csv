1,"Eric Ong CfaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Sep 2019I assume you are referring to Singapore PRs.There isn't a restriction for purchasing private properties.
However, if you are referring to HDB, then is either you are 35 years old or above, else must be a couple with another PR or Local.0 comments3"
2,"Meiling TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 4w agoThere's a pretty comprehensive guide on the kinds of property you can buy here (under ""If you're a Singapore PR""), but in short:As a single PR, you can't buy an HDB flat on your own. You can only do so with another family member who's also a PR (but you must both have been a PR for at least 3 years)Your best bet is private property (condos and such).You should have at least 25% of the condo's purchase price in cash savings/CPF OA. You'll need this for the downpayment since the bank will only loan you a max of 75% of the purchase price. But aim for more than this, since you'll also need to pay for renovations, furniture, lawyer fees, bank mortgage legal fees, buyer stamp duty, and so on.How much you should be earning depends on the cost of the property + how long a loan tenure you want. To be on the safe side, the general rule of thumb is that the mortgage payments should only take up 25% of your salary. (Most banks have home loan calculators so you can check what the monthly payments are in just a few minutes.)0 comments0"
