1,"Sandy ChamLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jun 2018A savings account should be rather different from a bond. Ie minimum sum, redemption wise, callability the feature of a coupon vs monthly interest rate. As for the 1 percent interest rate there are many high yield accounts that offer higher interest rates. 0 comments0"

But I would not compare it directly with a bond as this is more of an asset which is a higher-interest yielding 1% p.a savings account.​A bond would usually have the following characteristics: A debt security, under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity date. ​Your CPF would perform more like a bond where it matures at a certain age at a pretty high decent interest rate be it 2.5% or 4% p.a. with the OA and SA accordingly!0 comments0"
