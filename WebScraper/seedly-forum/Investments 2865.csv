Nowadays, it is trading around 23.460.If you really want to make a good profit by buying this share. I must recommend investing for 3-5 years. and If you want to make the profit by selling this stocks. Sell it now it may continue to fall for the next 15 days.0 comments0"

8,"Nicholas ChanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 16 Sep 2018If you believe DBS is good with further growth potential, then go ahead, prices have fallen quite abit from the peak earlier in the year. Otherwise buy the sti etf instead for diversification, I believe dbs is about 13% of the index. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Short answer is no ‚Äãplease do your own research instead of just listening to friends ‚Äãstock prices move up and down if the market crash are you ok with losing all your money ? ‚ÄãMaybe be at your age something more stable like STI is more stable‚Äãwhen you have a larger capital in the future that might be a better time to invest in more high risk stocks 0 comments0"
10,"Teresa WuLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Do not put all the eggs into 1 basket.
Do your research to see if the stock is overpriced at the moment and see if the stock is good fundamentally.
Good to get yourself covered with some insurances first before investing and go for some courses to learn more on how to plan your finances. All the best!0 comments0"
11,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Start small. I would rather you put your money into places with lesser returns first (such as the Singapore Savings Bond and Fixed Deposits) than blowing your money somewhere where you know nothing much about. Take the time to learn how to analyse stocks, learn some basic accounting, etc. Get as much information as you can first before putting your money in it. Don't regret!0 comments0"
12,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Not a good idea to put everything into one stock. If the market were to plunge, your stock hold will likely lose most of its value. Not something you'd want to face. Learn how to invest via the online materials available, or start with reading books like the intelligent investor to gain some knowledge on investing. And only invest what you can afford to loose, unless you know its gonna be a sure win then allocate more funds into it. Do feel free to ask if you need any more help. Cheers and all the best in your journey. 0 comments0"
13,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018DBS share price is not cheap now. Not the right time to go in.Everything in DBS means if is goes down you also lost 10k.  Theie fundamental and direction is right and good as most tech savvy bank at the moment. But it will gain value only in long term and also still subject to any market down turn since bank is the first level that gets hit hard. ‚ÄãSo why not read here at seedly more, ask more questions and learn more before doing anything ? üòÑüëç‚Äã‚Äã0 comments0"

15,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2018To be entirely honest, it sort of feels that you just heard something is good and decide to put all your eggs in one basket. This is no different from gambling, and hoping to make a quick buck. Before investing, you have to educate yourself, and you have to learn more about the different type of investments, companies, etc.‚ÄãBy investing everything in something, you already break a common principle of not diversifying your risk. Don't place blind bets on the market. Investing, very often, is not for quick wealth accumulation, but for small passive income. If you are unsure where to start, then read this!0 comments0"
16,Nicholes WongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2018Why DBS? Why not OCBC/UOB/REITS/SINGTEL/STI ETF? Learn and understand first before buying anything. Are you very sure you do not need the 10k and be good with losing some of it if stocks drops?0 comments0
