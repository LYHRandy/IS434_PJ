1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Aug 2019I've had a tenant (my first) who either didn't pay on time (he usually paid 1 month late), and in general was not contactable. That was a nightmare tenant.Thankfully, my second tenant(s) are a really nice couple!With regards to ease of getting tenants, it really depends on the area you are in. The key is in ensuring a high occupancy rate ie. don't leave the unit empty for too long.0 comments1"
