For benefit of doubts, 
You could lose more money for being ignorance. 
Ask yourself this question, how much or how far do you want to earn money from investment? Ascending orders (from 0)on how much energy or brain power to make a decision or action:
Option 1: savings - earning 0.05%interest (0 energy - because you already have one) 
Option 2: CPF (0-1 energy because garment help u unless you are freelancer) Option 3: RSS. Easiest to open dbs invest saver.(2options to choose). 3 other RSS ( Phillips, maybank, ocbc - not lazy enough to learn to choose counters) (energy varies based on difficulty of applications) Option   4 (if not lazy to open cdp accounts) - buy SSB ( 3-4 energy) Option 5:
Not lazy to sign up online for robo advisor?
Hmm choose which one??  (3-5 energy) Option 6:
Not lazy to talk to financial advisor? Endowment plans - earning 2-4% interest? Guaranteed principal + capital?? 
Wait, do you know how to differentiate between a ilps and endowment plan? 
(6-10 energy based on travelling time to meet one and how talkative or informative the advisor is) Choose 1.0 comments1"
2,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hello! i think you can opt for regualr savings plan that banks such as POSB offer where you only need to invest a regular amount monthly. Or you can also invest in cpf or SSB since these are safer forms of investments.However i think it is still important to know a little background of the investment you are doing before engaging in any investment!0 comments1

6,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 12 Mar 2019Go for investment courses, or learn about robo-advisors, Regular savings plans, Singapore Savings Bond, etc.Otherwise, try to be happy with the meagre amount of interest you get from banks. No such thing as making money if you are lazy.0 comments1"

If you are lazy, you probably should not think about investing at all.Failure to do your own due diligence may cause you to lose rather than earn money.Would suggest you read up about ETFs at the start.0 comments1"
