1,"Wilson Nid A BreakLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 04 Apr 2019Personally, given the info you had provided, I feel that you are in a great financial position to start off. There's no current need to fund your uni tuition fees, post graduation you are also student loan-free. In addition, you had the financial safety net of your parents being able to support themselves without the need on your side to contribute to family expenses. Lastly, you are only 19! You had the greatest asset for financial investing : Time.Hence, I am of the opinion you should start investing, instead of waiting post-graduation, thats a good 3-4 years of potential returns forgone and unable to chase back. As a personal suggestion, perharps keep $5k as a emergency fund and invest the rest of the $10k. To start off, I would recomend deploying a portion to REITS with a good sponsor such as Capitaland or Mapletree for example. The reason its becasue they provide consistent dividends payouts that steadily increase over time, and its stock fluctuations is not too violent for a beginner to stomach.I would strongly advise against STI as its growth potential pale in comparison to other established index suxh as S&P500, FTSE100 etc. Instead, go for ETFs such as Vanguard 500, buying thru a brokerage or Robo-Advisors with monthly/quarterly contributions.Meantime, continue to improve in your investment knowledge while in school & find new avenues to improve your take-home pay such as giving tuitions or part-time jobs/internships.  When you had a steady stream of active income to rely on to cover your daily expenses, any temporary price swings in your investments would be bearable & reduced your emotional risk of prematurely cutting losses. Lastly, if you wait till graduation to invest, it might take some time before you can get things on track as a huge portion of your time would be dedicated/pre-occupied to job interviews/networking/learning the ropes while on the job. While in uni,  you would had ample time to explore, experiment & mull over the pros & cons of various trading strategies/instruments.All e Best!0 comments6"

WonderkidUpdated on 07 Apr 2019Hi Anonymous!First thing first, i think you should be commended for your maturity and humility in thinking of and asking for help on personal finance.Like the phrase, personal finance is not just about math and logic but it is also PERSONAL. So it boils down to your plans, ask yourself these questions:Can i predict when i will get married?Can i predict when an emergency might hit my family or myself?Can i predict whether or not i will buy a luxury item?Now the bottom line is this, there are a few things in life you will never be able to predict, like qn 2 and to some extent qn 1 too.There are however decisions like qn 3 which are within our control. So what I'm saying is this:At your age, there are too many variables to do ""long term"" investment at a substantial amount, so start small and experiment. Use at most 10% to trade and learn more about the financial markets. Education is more important than results at this moment.Keep a prudent emergency fund, even if your parents are supporting you financially. #adultingLearn, learn and learn. Continue to ask great questions like this one and continue to learn. I'm sure you will do just fine financially üòäüëç0 comments3"

5,"Thanh DatLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 06 Apr 2019Hi members, At your age to have this amounts of moneys in hand is so good. Having scholarship to support your uni is wonderful. Is your scholarship able to support you for your basic need, foods, transportation. Since you plan not to collect monthly allowance from your parent. A $10k in uob savings fetch you only $0.38 a month. Is good for you to think about investing your money's. Maybe you can consider Stashaway as you can set the risk level. Deposit a smaller amounts first to monitor. Trade will be weekdays but they will place the trade according to your risk settings and amounts of funds. Same time if you really need the money for emergency. You can withdraw it.(I'm also in Stashaway investment) But if you target stocks, better be careful, are you a value investor who will hold long term if you buy STI. If you plan to buy stocks be ready to have the concept of lossing before winning. Is all investment. Do it small, don't be greedy. After all you are still young. Gain experience do part time like tuition, invest bit by bit. Of course every brokerage will love you when you buy big.0 comments1"
6,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019If you need to use the money in less than 10 years time, it is not recommended to put into stocks as they are volatile. If you need the money during a market recession, your returns will be affected significantly. You can consider putting the money into Singapore Saving Bonds first and start learning about investment through google and books. There are all sorts of investment method such as value, growth, dividends, index investing and there is no one size fit all method. You need to find the method that is the most suitable for you. It would be better to start the more risky investments once you have a regular income, emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses and insurance ready.You have to ask yourself why you want to invest in STI or other company stocks, lump sum investing or DCA. Once again, there is no one size fit all. You have to find out what is the best for yourself.0 comments1"
