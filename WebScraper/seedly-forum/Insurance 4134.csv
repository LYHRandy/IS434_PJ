If satisfied with lower class wards then probably no need for it. But if you want comfort in A class wards, then yes you probably need ISP 0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 03 Sep 2018My mom had a vision problem and it took less than 2 months from discovery to check up and operation to settle everything with minimal pain.My aunt had something similar and it took something like 2 years as a class c subsidized patient with a much longer post operative recovery period.End of the day, both were treated. It depends on how you weigh affordability against time/suffering.0 comments0"

4,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Sep 2018It's always about affordability.If you can afford to upgrade to Standard Plan under the insurers, please consider.Medishield Life can only account for 90% of all hospital (subsidised bills) for hospitalisation.The Standard Plan upgrade will cover up to 99% of all bills. And it's quite affordable. Medisave will cover the deductible and co-insurance.If you are looking at better healthcare, non-subsidised, then it will cost a lot more.0 comments0"
