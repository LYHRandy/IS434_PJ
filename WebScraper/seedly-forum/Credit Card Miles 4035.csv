1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Aug 2019Are you team miles or team cashback?Team miles would be DBS WMMV (4mpd, capped at 2K) or DBS Altitude Card (3mpd, capped at 5K using their dedicated link)Team cashback would be the one with the highest as long as you hit the card minimum spent.2 comments1"

I think Airbnb don't have to go through their DBS link though! As long as you spent using DBS Altitude, 3mpd will be given. Correct me if I'm wrong!Aik Kai13 Aug 2019Ah yes! You are right. No need to go through the dedicated link now. haha"
