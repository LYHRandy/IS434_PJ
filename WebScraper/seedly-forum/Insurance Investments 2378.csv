question,Insurance Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 05 Mar 2019Surrender my ILP?Hi all. I have a ILP which I paid premium of about $300/month. SA is $50k. I paid for about 2.5 years and have gone on ‘premium holiday’ for awhile now. Cessation year is 2089 which means I have to pay all the way till then? I didn’t do my due diligence on the plan after reading articles here and just trust my friend/FA back then cos I don’t quite uds investment at all. So the wise decision now is to surrender the plan? What are the qns I should ask my FA?2 answersAnswerBump0

God of WisdomAnswered on 05 Mar 2019You should look at the performance of the funds you're invested in and how active of a role has your advisor been to do rebalancing and fund monitoring. The good thing is that ILPs are quite flexible. Instead of surrendering, you can see if you can reduce the premium or sum assured.But you also have to ask yourself, if you stop this, what else are you going to do with 300 a month. And is it worth sinking 9k as opportunity cost. It's never ideal to cancel any insurance product. So do check your options.0 comments1"

RookieAnswered on 08 Mar 2019ILPs usually have charges involved so before you make any decision, go through your policy again. I believe surrendering your ILP now would probably mean a lost to all the premiums you have paid so far. Is the current $300/mth premium to taxing? ILPs like what Hariz mentioned are flexible. Reducing premium/sum assured are options you should also consider. You may want to ask your friend to explain to you on:charges involved from the investmenthow has the premium holiday affected your valueis their an option to stop the premium and yet have the value growis there a year where surrender the ILP do not incur any charges0 comments0"
