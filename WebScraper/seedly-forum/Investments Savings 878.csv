God of WisdomAnswered on 24 Jun 2019You can start by gaining some knowledge on investments and asset classes.Knowing how to invest may not mean that you choose to DIY your investment. It just means at least you know what sounds right and what sounds wrong. After that, if you choose to DIY, you can start purchasing stocks and funds by yourself. If you choose to get someone else to invest for you, you can work with a Financial Advisor either through digital platforms with the Robo Advisors or with a traditional advisor like myself.Either way, you should be investing or creating a globally diversified portfolio, across asset classes, geographies, and industries.Stay invested, and invest for the long term.0 comments4"
2,"Gavin TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 Jun 2019Hey there!! No investment knowledge is okay, because everyone starts with zero knowledge as well! The few things you may need to consider would be :How long are you gonna keep these investments for? (short term = 2-3years) or (long term = 5-10years)What is your risk appetite? Are you willing to risk more to obtain more or do you want something that gives maybe 2-3% returns a year?How much work are you willing to put in? or should I say how much time do you have that you can commit to this?Firstly to start off, if you want short term gains, maybe Endowment plans like what most banks are doing rn could be suitable for you since they are short plans, 2-3 years with decent returns.If you are going for the long term, then you can invest in many things, such as REITs or Blue Chips, that provide dividends. But before going into that, you need to do your own research, and make sure you're not putting money into a sinking ship! Personally I don't think you need to commit a lot of time, just a few hours a day just to do your research, and then you can just let your investments sit. Maybe check every quarter to see if the companies changed their business models, or are incurring tons of debt and have no means of dealing with it, etc.I personally adopt a dividend growth investing strategy, where I invest in companies that are not only providing dividends but also increasing the amount they give out every year. Some examples would be ComfortDelGro, and some REITs such as MIT and MCT.Another long term investment you can do is SSB, which is safer, meaning the returns are also lower than what you can get from investing in stocks. All in all, the decision is up to you, whether or not you have a higher risk appetite or just wanna play safe. Good luck in your investing journey Anon!0 comments1"
3,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 24 Jun 2019Hi there, if you have zero investment experience, wants something easy to do (""requires minimal attention""), the next question you should ask is if you're willing to outsource the investment to someone to do it for you. Blue chips is ok, but you'll need about an hour a week to do research and make decisions based on your own judgement. Can go for value investing strategies that focus on long term capital growth and regular dividend payout.$20k is quite a lot of money to start. You may want to diversify into 2 areas, half on blue chips where you DIY on investments and half on other investments where you outsource the process, e.g. unit trusts and robo advisors.What you choose depends on your risk appetite and what you like to achieve on your investments. Never forget your investment goals.0 comments1"

And if you are not too sure on what to start off with, you can always go through ETF, Robo or Funds that already help you to diversify in the first place.
And in this current market situation, you might want to consider investing through regular monthly investment instead of a lump sum.0 comments0"
