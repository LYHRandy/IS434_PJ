1,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 02 Nov 2018You should consider placing your money in SSB now.Even though the interest rates are increasing each month, you can choose to place your money in SSB then withdraw and reposit it the following month. It only costs a transaction fee of $2.SSB prorates your interest for the month if you choose to withdraw early, so if the interest rate increases each month, you can choose to withdraw your SSB early and redeposit them again.However, this requires some active management on your end. You also run into the risk of being unable to be allotted as there is a maximum subscription for SSB each month.For 1 Nov 2018, the maximum amount offered was $300,000,000.Read more about the allotments here: http://www.sgs.gov.sg/~/media/SGS/SGS%20Announcements%20pdf/SSB%20PDF/2018/GX18110Z%20Result.pdf0 comments2"
