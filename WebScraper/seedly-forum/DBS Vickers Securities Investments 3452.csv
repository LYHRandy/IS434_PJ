1,"Prakash KumaraswamiLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 04 Sep 2018CDP account is required only if you trade on SGX. However, I recommend you to have a CDP account - Its free, allows you to buy ETFs of different markets (listed in SGX)0 comments0"
2,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Investing in foreign stocks do not require CDP because foreign stocks will be held in custodian with your bank or brokerage.​CDP only holds local SG products.​You probably need to take note of the custodian charges and fees, as well as any taxation, when investing in foreign stocks.1 comment0"
