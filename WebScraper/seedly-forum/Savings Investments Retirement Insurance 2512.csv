question,Savings Investments Retirement Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Mar 2019Should I terminate a insurance plan that i initially though would be part of my retirement fund?Got the great wealth multiplier from ge as a secondary retirement/potential children education fund. (I think it a mix of Savings + a bit of ilp)Rationale of buying then: forced savings plan and let it roll until I surrender policy + I didn't know a lot about investment.Now: taking necessary steps to learn abt investment and want to use that sum to invest instead.Any advice on how to proceed? Cause I'm weighing the opp cost of continuing the plan vs doing diy investing.1 answerAnswerBump0

too much of the premium would already be sunk.
you would only be taking back less that a fraction of what you paid up.
so might as well enjoy what protection your past self has purchased.0 comments0"
