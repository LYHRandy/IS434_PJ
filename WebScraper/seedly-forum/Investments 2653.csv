1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Feb 2019Since debt to capital measures a company's leverage, you can also consider looking at coverage measures as well. Leverage ratios measures how much capital is from debt. This is a good way to measure whether the company can pay off its debts. There metrics that are debt related as well. Coverage ratios should also be used. They refer to how is a gauge of the number of times an earnings measure covers an expense measure. One exmaple is EBITDA divided by interest expense. Other metrics that might wanna look at are liqudity and solvency ratios. Liquidty ratios measure the ability of an organization to pay off its short-term obligations, while solvency ratios looks at measure the ability of a company to meet its long term debts. 0 comments0"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019Hello, besides looking at the debt to capital ratio, the debt to equity ratio can also be used as an alternative measure to evaluate a company's debt situation. You can also look at the profitability ratios such as the return on equity ratio as well as the return on assets ratio. Always look at a variety of measurements and not rely just on one aspect in order to get a better picture of the company's financial health and performance. Hope this helps! 0 comments0"
