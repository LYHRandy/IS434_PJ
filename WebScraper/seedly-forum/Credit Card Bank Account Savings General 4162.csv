1,"Huang Yixuan, Industrial Design at National University Of SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Hey there! The greyed out transactions are basically ""ignored"" transactions. For example, after you sync your account on Seedly, the expenses of your credit card is tracked, let's say total $1000. When you make payment for that credit card, the transaction of credit card payment shows as an expense of $1000. That would double count your transactions, which would make it inaccurate. Hence when you toggle to ""ignore"" for the transaction, your total expenses would be accurate.0 comments0"
