1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019Hi there! It's easy to get confused with a REIT and a Business Trust as both are listed on the SGX as ""trusts"". Despite both a REIT and a Business Trust owning the same type of asset, there are multiple differences. The main difference between the two is that a REIT is involved in real etate whereas a Business Trust is not restricted to real estate and can operate in any field. Some other differences include management structure, gearing limitand dividend distribution. In terms of management structure, a REIT involves two separate entities (manager who runs operation, and trustee who owns the asset) while a business trust is managed by the same entity that owns the assets and manages them. The management structure comes into importance when unitholders request for a change in management. In a REIT, unitholders can remove the manager of the REIT with more than 50% of ""yes"" vote however, a business trust require a 75% ""yes"" vote. The gearing ratio for REIT is limited to 35% but a business trust does not have a borrowing limit. This ratio is an indicator of the level of leverage of the REIT or business trust hence, business trusts may be riskier as there is no hard limits on how much they can borrow. Lastly, REITs and business trusts differ in the policies regarding the level of dividends. REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income through dividends annually. This ensures a regular stream of income for REITs investors. Conversely, business trusts do not have to adhere to a minimum level of payout. A possible follow-up question would be ""which of the two should I invest in?""The first step to choosing between a REIT and a business trust would be to determine your investment objectives. For a passive income, investing in REITs would be appropriate. Whereas if you're looking to be engaged in the business operations, a business trust could potentially provide defensive returns through regular income distributions and high payout ratios.0 comments3"

MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019Hello!The main difference between REITs and a Business trust is that REITs needs to be involved in real estate while such a restriction does not apply to Business Trusts. Here are some other differences between REITs and a Business Trust1) Legal structure For the case of business trusts, it is the same entity which owns and manages the assets on behalf of the unitholders of the busniess trust. While a REIT would need to hold the assets and a separate manager to manage the assets for unitholders. The trustee for a REIT must be a licensed entity approved by the authorities. 2) Differences in leverageA REIT is only allowed a gearing ratio of up to 35%, but it will be able to boost its gearing ratio to 60% should it be able to obtain a credit rating from rating agencies. While a business trust do not need to subject themselves to any borrowing limit. 3) Level of distributionsA business trust does not need to distribute any of its income while a REIT must pay out 90%  of its “distributable income” under the Income Tax Act.0 comments1"
