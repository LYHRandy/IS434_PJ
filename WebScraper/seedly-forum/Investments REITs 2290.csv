MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hi there! you can judge a REIT by comparing the Price/NAV of the REIT against comparable REITs (in the same geography from a competing property developer) to determine if its overvalued. In general, price of REITs trade in tandem so it is not often to find bargins in REITs. Another value to look for the capitalisation rate. A lower cap rate translates to higher valuation for the property and vice cersa. You can compare this to the indicative cap rates for the specific markets for instance, the indicative cap rate for singapore is 4-5%.0 comments1"
