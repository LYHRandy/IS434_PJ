question,"CPF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Jun 2019How does CPF Life payout work?If I have the maximum 264k in my CPF RA at the age of 55, the amount of payout I will get at age 65 is $2110? If I only have maximum 265k in my CPF RA at the age of 65, the amount of payout I will get at age 65 is $1960? Based on the simple calculation (non-interest bearing), the ""breakeven"" point $1960 for is ~135 months of payout. Hence, If I live pass ~72 years old, I would have ""obtained"" back the 265k placed in my CPF RA? Is the above calculation correct?2 answersAnswerBump0"

So it's 11 years to break even from the 55 yr old figure and 16 years from the 65 yr old figure.Anything after that is ""profit"".
But note that the bequest drops down to 0 after 16 years on the standard plan, so you're just literally paying yourself till that age and only ""earn"" if you live longer than that.2 comments3"
2,"Question Poster28 Jun 2019Thank you. How do you derive the figures of 16 years from the 65 yr old figure? Isn't it 264k/1.96 = ~134 months = 11 years? Understand that the above figures does not include interest, which will slightly increase the ""breakeven"" years.

Does the bequest drop to 0 after 16 years means that I should have been able to ""breakeven"" principal + interest by the 16th year? Anything after that is ""profit""?Hariz Arthur Maloy28 Jun 2019From 65 then you definitely need to calculate the interest. CPF Life pays you your RA for life. But depletes it in 16 years. You can double check with the CPF Life calculator provided by CPF. So from 65 to 81, you're just getting back your RA. After that if you still live on, you'll be earning a profit from the interest on the pooled life fund for those that died earlier than you."

GeniusUpdated on 13 Sep 2019What you must understand is that CPF Life is a public annunity that is compulsory in nature whose payout is based on premiums that you contribute into the Lifelong Income Fund, and the plan you choose: Basic/Standard/Escalating.For  the basic plan, 10% of your RA is deducted at age 55. The rest – about  90 per cent – of the Retirement Account savings is untouched and can  continue to grow and compound with interest. Near 65, two months before your birthday, there will be a second deduction. This time, it will be approximately 10 per cent of the new money that has built up between  your 55th and 65th birthday. The rest of your Retirement Account savings  will stay put until your payout eligibility age.In comparison, for the standard and escalating plan, for those who join this plan at  age 55, there will be two installments deducted as annuity premiums just  at 55 and near 65, just like the basic Plan – but the percentage of  deductions differs.
Members who join this plan at age 55 will  have the Retirement Account deducted for their CPF Life annuity premiums  in two installments – at age 55 and near 65. The first deduction is up  to the current Basic Retirement Sum of $80,500. The premium goes into  the Lifelong Income Fund.
Two months before you reach 65, the  balance Retirement Account savings will be deducted as the second  installment of your annuity premium and channeled into the Lifelong  Income Fund. This will include any new money, including interest earned  or refunds from sale of property or investments that you have built up  between your 55th birthday and 65.
For members who join the  Standard or Escalating Plan on their payout eligibility age or after,  there will be only one annuity premium deduction, which is all the sum  in their Retirement Account, made at the time of joining.
CPF Life is structured such that 3 out of 4 people will only “obtained"" what that has been put into the amount.1 comment0"
