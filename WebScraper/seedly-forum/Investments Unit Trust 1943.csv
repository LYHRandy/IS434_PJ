1,Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Mar 2019A unit trust fund pools money from investors to meet a specific financial objective. The manager of the fund then takes the money and invest it in various shares or bond. A mutual fund is similar to a unit trust however differing factor is the legal structure. A mutual fund issues redeemable shares while a unit trust can only issue units as it is not an investment company.0 comments2
