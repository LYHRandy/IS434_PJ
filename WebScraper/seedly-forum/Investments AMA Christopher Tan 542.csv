If you can wait till March when MoneyOwl launch our investment service, you will be able to gain access to Dimensional funds. If you can't and must invest now, you can invest via Endowus.The difference between Endowus and MoneyOwl is this: Endowus uses PIMCO for the bonds allocation of their portfolios. PIMCO is an active bond manager. Also, Endowus is a roboadviser.For MoneyOwl, for both the equities and bonds portion of our portfolios, we only use Dimensional, which is an evidenced-based fund manager who does not time the market. In addition, MoneyOwl is a bionic adviser -meaning you can use our roboadviser to get advice but at the same time, you have access to our salaried-based adviser to get a second opinion overlayed with human wisdom.Do check out www.moneyowl.com.sg when we roll out our investment service.0 comments3"
