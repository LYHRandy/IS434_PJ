1,"Zin HtooLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019No, it is not against the law as the Financial Services Consultant is an intermediary that is licensed to advise you based on your financial needs. Upon which after your policy is incepted, it is between you and the company. However, the consultants as an action of good faith, assist their clients in the claims and further financial health reviews. The norm is that the company will inform you that there will now be a new agent appointed to help to manage your profile. However, it is not against the law if they do not so.
