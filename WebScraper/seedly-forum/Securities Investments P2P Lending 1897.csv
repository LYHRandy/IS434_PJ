question,"Securities Investments P2P Lending Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Mar 2019Can anyone help me with my P2P questions? I am new to and interested in the P2P platforms. Currently looking at CoAssets but I have got some questions even after reading the recent article in Seedly. (Pardon me if they sound noob)For most of the platforms that mentions of a minimum $1K investment, is this a one-time thing, or a monthly thing?I'm not so sure for this, but for the $1K, do one have to invest all the amount into a single campaign, or can I invest eg. $500 into campaignA and the other $500 into campaignB etc?2 answersAnswerBump0"
