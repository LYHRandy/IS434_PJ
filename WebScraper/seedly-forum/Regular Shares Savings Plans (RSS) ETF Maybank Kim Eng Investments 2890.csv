MasterAnswered on 17 Jan 2019I'm personally using this platform to dca into Mapletree commercial every month to build my income floor portfolio. Changing to logistics trust soon as I feel that commercial is already fairly priced. I like that the platform offers reits as a choice, especially strong ones like Mapletree. Reasonable divs and some capital appreciation, not to mention strong sponsor parents, are my basic criteria. Though it also offers counters from overseas, I feel it's not worth it especially for the US counters. There are better ways to obtain stock at a lower cost, and getting paid to wait through the use of options for example. 0 comments1"
