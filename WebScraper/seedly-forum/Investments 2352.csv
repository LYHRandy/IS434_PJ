1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019I believe anyone would tell you to be critical of their teachings- especially since some might have hidden agendas eg. monetise their ""secret trading community"". What worked for them in their investment style might not work for you- and their so called ""track record"" of supposed good buys does not mean you should idolise them.That being said- I think Warrior Investing youtube channel has pretty interesting content for interested day traders out there.0 comments0"
