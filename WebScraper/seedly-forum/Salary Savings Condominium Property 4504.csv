If youâ€™re a Singaporean, then I would advise you to save for your house!â€‹Of course, if there are other reasons that you choose to rent a house, rent is quite affordable now. So it wouldnâ€™t be a wrong time to rent as well! 0 comments2"

3,"ZongzongLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 01 Oct 2018Thereâ€™s some ratio I think, anything more than 1/3 of your take-home pay is too much. Try to keep it within 1/4 and below of your take-home pay.â€‹but I understand your needs for a one-br, hang in there for a few more years to get BTO. Or share a HDB unit with a few other friends.0 comments1"
4,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Oct 2018I don't think is a good idea. Rental of condo is much more expensive than a HDB. If you require the facilities, there are cheaper options for gym and pool.0 comments1"
5,Choon Yuan ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Sep 2018Not advisable to rent a one bedder condo with your take home pay of 2600. Firstly rental will be close to 1k and you have to pay your own utilities. Use the extra money to accumulate wealth and buy a flat at the later stage of your life. (assuming you are Singaporean) 0 comments1
6,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 29 Sep 2018One bedroom condo unit  would have cost at least 1.4k to rent. That means you're left with 1.2k to live. Assuming that you only take public transport and some grab/taxi  $200, hawker meals & restaurant $600. Self grooming : $100. Entertainment: $150. Shopping : $150. â€‹Means you have nothing left. No saving so any emergency you're without help Cannot stop working as no emergency fund for back up. â€‹No investment so no future. â€‹That sounds like a pretty bad decision for me. â€‹Maybe consider a quiet nice HDB room  from a landlord. . With aircond would have cost about $750 to $900 even near city. Reduce other cost would have been effect a better life.

7,"Nicholas ChanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 01 Oct 2018What's the price of that? If its almost the same as a hdb room, why not? 0 comments0"
8,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 01 Oct 2018Not advisable, after deduction of the rental which generally  $1K, there isn't much left for personal expenses and savings nor spare money to invest.0 comments0"
9,Tina Sharon LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 01 Oct 2018Nope unless you are getting a huge discount and the rent is nominal say 500 pm. Or you plan to start a home business or sublet or do some short term accommodation.  Otherwise not a good idea in Sg.0 comments0
10,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Sep 2018With that amount of take home, I'd suggest looking towards rental of a hdb room instead. Depends on location and how you negotiate with the landlord it'll be much lower than your idea of renting a one bedder condo. This will free up your cash flow for other things in life like planning for big ticket items and retirement. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 30 Sep 20182.6k is not a lot to work with after you minus all the fixed expenses like travel, food, bills, insurance, mobile etcâ€‹It will be a stretch to rent a condo unit and I think you should go with a HDB room.â€‹The savings can be used for investments which will reap you more benefits.â€‹you can upgrade to a more comfortable place later when your income increases.However it would be most ideal to save that money for your own place ultimately 0 comments0"
12,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Sep 2018how much is the rent? why do you need to stay in a condo? How about saving for retirement?These are questions to ask yourself. If there is no need to stay in a condo, you can use your spare money to invest.0 comments0"
