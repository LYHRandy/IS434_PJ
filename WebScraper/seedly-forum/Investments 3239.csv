1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 02 May 2018Hi there! This is a good question and to have around $60k saved up before entering university is a pretty good way to start. There are a few layers which I would think is best to address this query or situation you have.​Key Considerations:​1) What is your time frame 2) What is your risk appitite3) Do you believe in lump sum or dollar cost averaging​From the above 3 questions, you can identify which investment or savings strategy you would have.For example, I would recommend the following:​Total amount: $60kLess: Rainy day funds: $6k (6 months of comitted expenses, if you spend $1k a month)Balance: $54k​If you are more risk taking, you can invest the bulk of it (eg 70%) into blue-chip dividend paying stocks (eg banks or REITs) which potentially yield 4-6% p.a​If you are less risk taking, you can actually put the bulk of it (eg 70%) into savings account which are high yield (eg 1% p.a like a CIMB account) the remainder 30% you can put it into a REIT or ETF like the STI ETF (Which tracks the singapore index, comprising of 30 of Singapore's top companies)0 comments3"

3,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Sep 2018Suggest going for safer options since you might need it for your University studies. Consider putting it in CIMB Fastsaver to get 1% interest or CIMB's Fixed Deposit account for 1.84% interest for 12 months (promo till end of September). Alternatively, you can buy Singapore Savings Bond too as your capital is guaranteed and is liquid as well0 comments0"

6,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 30 Jul 2018So admirable. On your question whether you need emergency funds, I guess will depend on whether your family may need you as a safety net (in case monetary contribution is needed).To grow your savings, I suggest to open either 
1. CIMB Fast Saver for fuss free 1% per annum interest up to $50k. Pro is it offers you flexibility when you need the money in future.
2. Or can consider Citibank Maxigain for interest from 1.2% which will step up to 2.4% after a year (monthly increase by 0.1%). Pro is higher interest but if you withdraw, your counter will drop which means your interest rate will drop. 0 comments0"
7,"James YeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Jul 2018Risk profile low - buy singapore savings bond, or high yield savings account like maybank etc.Risk profile medium - buy blue chip stocks, reits or index. Capitmalltrust give you 5% yield and dbs around 4% yield. Thats annual passive income of $3k or $2.4kRisk profile high - go for small-mid cap stocks or p2p lending. Since u got long term horizon in front of you.Cheers!0 comments0"
8,"Pascal SamsoonLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 16 May 2018Best way to increase your savings? ​There are a few usual suspects here:Savings account (CIMB FastSaver seems like a good one since you are not working)Singapore Savings Bond (Incremental interest rate, maturity in 10 years time, and should be redeemed  approx 1 month before you need the cash)But you could also...and here we are moving out of the realm of savings...Try P2P Lending (you will be taxed on the income received in the form of 'interest') - ReviewsInvesting as per what other people have suggestedUse the $60,000 to angel invest in 6 early-stage ideas while in universityOn my last point: University is where you will find future startup entrepreneurs (Link, Link)  Seedly's own Kenneth Lou was from NUS and some of my former bosses at Ninja Van were from SMU. (Polytechnics also have entrepreneurs!)​Investing in early-stage ideas is highly risky with (potentially) high reward. Being in school for +3 years will the opportunity for you to find the rare gems before they are snatched away by other angel investors, venture capitalist and grants. ​Hope it helps​Pascal 0 comments0"
