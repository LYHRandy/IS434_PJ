WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi Douglas here. 2nd Key note speaker.Yeah, recently there had been ads advertising for Tokyo properties.Overseas properties are always tricky. Many Singaporea investors have been burnt as they buy into properties where it was stopped half way in construction, or worse never built.One way to mitigate the risk is to buy only completed properties, so u don't have the risk of buying a non-finished product. Buying is easy. But disposal is tricky as u have to get their local agency or local agents to transact for u. And it's not easy to manage your property from afar.I generally won't recommend overseas properties unless the risks are well ring-fenced and minimised. You also have to contend with exchange rate fluctuation, overseas with-holding taxes, management fees etc etc But at the end of the day, it's matter of individual risk appetite.​​​
