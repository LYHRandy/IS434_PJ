1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 12 Apr 20191,000,000 adjusted with inflation or just 1,000,000 will do?If you want just 1,000,000 (not adjusted for inflation), its very easy to achieve that with a balanced and properly managed portfolio of about 4.4% annual returns yearly for about 35 years. And you can do that through various financial instruments.But by then 1,000,000 will be worth probably around 300,000 only.So if you want 1,000,000 in todayâ€™s value, as a young early 20s adult. It is important to decide your portfolio strategy and constantly have it reviewed. 
It is also important to keep it protected.Think about the portfolio (Capital gains, Income generation, Property, businesses, Etc) you want and constantly review it and change it to adapt your life stages and expectations.0 comments8"

To you right now $1,000 seems like it's the acceptable amount that you can achieve in your savings goal. But if you are like many singaporeans who have a degree, most of them if not spenders could easily save more than $1,000 a month.In fact many Singaporeans can achieve a networth of $1,000,000 in their lifetime, so it's not a big feat actually, especially when we have one of the highest concentration of millionaires in the world in our country.Why would you want to have 1mil when you're 60 when it is possible for you to achieve that when you're 40 or 45 and enjoy more of the rest of your life while you still have energy to do so?My tip is to aim bigger. Even if you fall short of your goal, it's still something you're happy with.1 comment5"

God of WisdomUpdated on 30 Jul 2019If you're 25 now, you just need to have your 1k per month compound at 4.6% annually to achieve 1m in 35 years.You can do this easily with a balanced globally diversified portfolio of funds.You can set this up with a FA or a Robo Advisor or of course DIY.2 comments5"
5,"Linda Tan01 Apr 2019Any tips on where to invest this?Hariz Arthur Maloy01 Apr 2019I can set up a globally diversified portfolio for you, or you can go through a robo advisor. If you prefer robo, there are platforms I distribute and partner with as well. Some of them have minimum amounts to enter though."
6,"Alvyn KianLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 01 Jul 2019Invest in DBS stock. share price is escalating annually and dividends are also growing. At the current dividend you are getting $0.30 for each quarter (3months) which u hold the stock. It means a yield of 4.6% annually. Each $100,000 u hold in the stock will pay u almost $1150 a quarter for life. if u check the dividend payout the dividends are also increasing annually as the bank grows. They have branches all over Asia from Singapore to China.
I invested $50,000 in this stock back In 1999 and now in 2019 the value of my holdings has balloon to $250,000. Back then I was only getting $600 a quarter in dividends. Now I am getting almost $2700 each quarter.dividends are great....they reward u in cash for saving and investing. U can use the money each quarter to buy more stock or simply give yourself a treat Like a staycation or a new handphone. Each year I get around $11000 in dividends and I use the money to travel1 comment2"

8,"Luke Ho, Kick-Ass Financial Services Consultant at Trillion Financial PlannersLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 30 Jul 2019Here's an idea, since Clarence already pointed out the very conservative approach you can do. I wrote this article for this kind of scenario.
https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/post/why-you-should-invest-aggressively-now-and-how-you-still-can-have-peace-of-mind
Take an aggressive approach. Statistically, any portfolio that has a 20 year horizon or above, with Dollar-Cost-Averaging like yours ($1000/mth or $12000 a year) can afford to go 100% equities.
You have a couple of options (non-inflation adjusted)1) Take riskier, concentrated positions and go for 13% or higher annualized - you'll have about $1mil in less than 20 years.
2) Take a diversified global portfolio option but with 100% equities. With rebalancing that I offer on my end, you could try for a decent 8% net of fees easily. So again, you could get $1mil in about 20 years, letting it roll for 7 more years for considerable less risk. I would recommend this option if you don't have a lot of investment experience.In any case, you can see from both cases that you can retire well before 60. To cope with inflation, we can turn your lump sum into a variable annuity - meaning that we'll strategically calculate how much money should be withdrawn along with your dividend to match inflation and you'll be dead before the entire sum is used up. We'll also adjust your portfolio as you get older to make this end result more favorable.
Go big, since you're already starting so young and investing an amount that's pretty high for your age. For illustration, here's a successful recipient of example number 1 - his capital was $12,000 in December 2018, and it's this much now.

ProdigyUpdated on 30 Jul 2019Hi Linda,To get to this $1m in 30years plus with $1,000 seems doable based on some of the math done already for you. A diversified investment portfolio will do 4-6%pa and match that objective perfectively.I'd focus the answer instead on ""what should you do""And it starts with reframing the approach $1,000/m for next 30years.For the next 30years, the journey is not going to be linear. Your income will likely increase at some stage and decrease at some stage.For the next 30years there will be major purchases made such as house and major changes such as a child or a sick parent.Hence, will the $1,000/m to reach $1m become a pure mathematical projection?What should you do?1) Save more when you earn more. Spend your effort to upgrade and earn more. And then actively increase your invested amounts2) Track your progress and plan to hit ahead of time because things happen. A prudent businessman checks his accounts at least every month if not every week.3) Find out what really motivates you to hit the $1m mark and what you'd do to stay satisfied once you it that. Pin that up onto your cupboard or your desktop.I've an article that you may find interesting and it's on financial independence. I wish you all the best. https://www.theastuteparent.com/2019/04/financial-independence-fatfire/0 comments1"

11,"Allan Lee, Financial Planner at Axa SingaporeLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 09 Apr 2019With a savings of $1,000/month, you're considered healthy in this sense. Perhaps you can look into AXA's AXA Wealth Treasure to grow your money there, a guaranteed 100% start up bonus might bring you to $1,000,000 before you turn 60. You also get to invest in stuffs which are not accessible to the retail investors. Hit me up if you've any burning questions.0 comments1"
12,"Wang WeiduoLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would like to recommend moderately conservative to balanced portofolio for AXA Wealth treasure. By that portofolio, you will be able to achieve a million in 25-30 years time. Investments will be of mutual funds offered by AXA  and numerous financial institutions. You can look up on the official website or have a discussion with me.1 comment2"

14,"Andrew Fong, Associate Partner at St. James's Place Wealth ManagementLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you save $1,000 a month for 30 years, you will be able to achieve that target sum of $1,000,000 but only if you place the money in a financial instrument that will give you returns of approxiamately 6% per annum.Key point: you will have to invest the $1,000 a month as the bank interest alone (based on current rates) will not be enough.3 comments1"

17,"See all 3 comments Jonathan Chia Guangrong01 Apr 2019Hi Linda. As I mentioned, it will be best if you find a mentor to guide you on how to manage an option portfolio due to the amount of risk involved. You can find a list of mentors/trainers here: https://www.eventbrite.sg/d/singapore--singapore/option-trading/?page=1 go attend the free previews and find one that you believe is the best person to guide you to your financial/investment goals.
