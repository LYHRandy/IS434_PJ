WonderkidAnswered on 11 Aug 2018Hi Jay!​I've personally used a blended learning approach:Chosen languages that I know I will be exposed to oftenLanguage-learning partners/communities (this one requires fairly high commitment)Online resources (""Easy Languages"" on Youtube is great and they cover a LOT of languages)Libraries​For Korean, I've really liked http://talktomeinkorean.com/ (videos with subtitles, podcasts, transcripts of conversations, helpful community). They sell textbooks and supplementary lesson materials now but a lot of the stuff remains free. I use Duolingo occasionally so I don't forget things so quickly now that I'm not really using the language.​For French, Duolingo helps with regular practice & vocab building after you've grasped the basics, though I've found that the web version is better at explaining grammar (there are moderators that answer common questions). Alliance Francaise has a library with kids' books that you can visit for free (the membership is for borrowing the books). I'm also a fan of an app called Frantastique because it adjusts to your ability and the contest delivery is just very entertaining - however it's only free for 1 month, after which you can choose to pay a subscription (it's worth it if you're serious).​0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018When I did my 6 months internship in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I used Hellotalk to learn some basic Vietnamese so that I get around easily and interact with the locals. It's free and you can get to make new local friends as well as teach each other. 0 comments0"

6,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I tried Duolingo and others but i find not helping as they are not that interactive but trying to teach me to see the words and pronouce them. ​I managed to learn cantonese last time watching all the shows / movie and try to find some to practise it. ​Key: Go watch youtube show of the language daily , movies , songs.If you can find someone to speak that language best , go make some friends of that native speaker and speak that daily if possible or not weekly with him/her. ​It's only practise frequently that will help master the conversation of the new language. 0 comments0"
7,"Steph Yeo, Auntie Uncle Whisperer at Agency for Integrated CareLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 28 Aug 2018I feel that languages are best learnt through practice, so if you're learning a language to speak it (rather than just to write or read), you should find opportunities to speak to people in that language. Hence online may not be the most effective. But if cost is an issue, maybe consider using your skillsfuture credits?0 comments0"
8,"Pascal Samsoon, MBA Candidate at Singapore Management UniversityLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 Aug 2018If you take MRT or bus on a frequenty basis, one of the best things to do is to learn a new language. ​Duolingo is one of the best native mobile app for learning a new language. You could even learn High Valyrian on it. ​I am fluent in 3 languages, and can survive in 2 more. I am now on my 3rd language for survival mode. ​Cheers,Pascal from Time to first byte0 comments0"
9,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I did try Duolingo for awhile but gave up halfway. Ended up trying online free Podcasts, where they converse with you while you take the train or mrt, did 2 lessons for Bahasa Indonesia. Then gave up halfway.​I also did go to try and learn French level 1 for 3 months at the French Toast (some language school in Thompson area) but also not very ideal cos I forgot everything already. ​I think the best way to learn a new language is to actually go and live in that country where you are planning to be based at. And you will learn it by hook or by crook. :) All the best!1 comment0"
