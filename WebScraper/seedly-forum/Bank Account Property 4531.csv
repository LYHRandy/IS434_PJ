WonderkidAnswered on 20 Aug 2018Your mother need to write a will to transfer the HDB to you, else it will need to be Administered when she passes on without a will, and will cost more money to transfer. Since you already have a HDB, you will then be required to sell your mom's HDB, since you can't own 2 under HDB rules.0 comments0"
