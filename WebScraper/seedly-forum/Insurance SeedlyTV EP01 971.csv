1,"Cherie Julianne Tan, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019AIA plans are not the cheapest plans in the market. However, I do feel that AIA Vitality is the dealbreaker for me. For $8/month, I can earn up to $10 vouchers ($5 + $5) on Grab, Cold Storage or Starbucks. Effectively, that is $32 ($40-$8) earned just by keeping fit.Do check with your trusted financial advisor if signing up for AIA Vitality has premium discounts for your PA or hospitalisation plans. Look through the benefit table if the plans covers your needs as well. Hope this helps!1 comment2"

FreshieAnswered on 24 Apr 2019Hey there, I would advise you to check with an independant advisor and compare a couple of prices for personal accident and hospitalization plans first before committing to AIA because the premiums for AIA are indeed not necessarily the cheapest. Personally for me, I used to have AIA vitality but I cancelled it because they increased the conditions (ie. the number of daily steps you have to hit daily, plus everyone in your group needs to hit their targets) to get the $5 + $5. It got ridiculously high to hit and I didn't have the time to walk around to get the steps required. Hope this helps.0 comments0"
