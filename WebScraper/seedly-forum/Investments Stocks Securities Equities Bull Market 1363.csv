1,"Hao Yu, Advisory Specialist at MoneyOwlLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 09 May 2019Normally when you purchase a share, you would have done certain valuations to determine your target price/take profit price. Be discipline and stick to your plan. (Siimilar to the previous 2 answes by Gabriel and Billy, itâ€™s about sticking to your game plan.) If you do not have a game plan, that is when you have this issue of whether to sell when prices are high.0 comments1"
2,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 09 May 2019Echoing what Gabriel mentioned, how would you define high?52 week high? Weekly high? 10% above your entry priceGreed is what kills us, set a reasonable take-profit price - based on price movements and fundamentals of the company (and vice versa, a stop-loss price), be disciplined about it and let it go when time comes. In behavioural finance, there's a theory whereby humans feel more negativity losing $1 rather than the joy from gaining that same $1. Fun fact :)0 comments1"
3,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 09 May 2019What is your game plan?If your plan is to take profit from a position, do it.If you just want to sell because you see the prices at all time high, then what will you do with the cash? The key is know why you are selling and what is the game plan. We have no crystal ball to tell us when is the absolute high.0 comments1"
