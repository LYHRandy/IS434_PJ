1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019You can consider if you know what to do with CFDs and if you are 100% certain about the direction of the underlying counter. Remember, it is a double edged sword so your position can go against you as well and it'll be harder to climb back up.0 comments0"
2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Mar 2019CFD is a complex vehicle for investment, mainly speculation. While there are high possible returns, the risk is non-neglectable. To grow by another 10k in 9 months, you're expecting more than 100% profit per annum. To give you a sense on how much that is, Peter Lynch, regarded as on of the world's best investors, scored about 29.2% annualised rate of return. That is to say you're looking to beat the one of the world's best by 3x.The other possible way with less risk is to have a side job. The pay only needs to be 1k per month which is more feasible.0 comments0"
