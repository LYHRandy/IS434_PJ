1,"Luke Ho, Venture Capitalist at CFXLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Aug 2018This is going to be hard for me to answer neutrally, but since I'm on vacation and in a really good mood...‚ÄãFirst of all, asking you very personal, possibly jarring questions about your financial status is very normal. Personally, to me anyway - the more jarring, the better. My model has always been the fella who wastes no time exposing both the strengths and flaws in your financial portfolio. Your time is money - the less time you spend on it and the more time someone else does, the more you benefit.‚ÄãOf course, thats theoretical. So it has to be a combination of four things:   1) Sincerity   2) Knowledge   3) Effort   4) Feel ‚Äã1) You already mentioned he seems sincere. I think one of the best ways to gauge sincerity is that the planner is extremely upfront with his/her limitations. Maybe hes new. Maybe he's not the best dresser. Maybe the question you asked him is actually too hard for him. Whatever it is, you get a clear picture of someone who is very honest and not a poseur who wants to inspire a false sense of confidence in you - but someone who just wants to help you to his best ability. That's why it has to be balanced with -‚Äã2) There has to be a limit to how little you know. If you ask 10 questions and the FA can't answer 8 off the bat or at least something that sounds logical, you kind of know this may not be the FA for you. As a general rule, I never sell something I can't answer eventually or something that the client may potentially be better than me at - which is not that all uncommon today. But at the same time, ‚Äã3) You want to gauge more on the effort of the FA rather than his present knowledge. This is ESPECIALLY important if you're getting from someone who is a) around your age  b) a friend.  If the person can't answer a question, does he get back to you promptly with the answer after finding someone or a resource that does? ‚ÄãThis is actually a very common occurrence when it comes to buying CI policies, Term or Life, because while the insurers have to follow LIA guidelines, their definitions for claiming can be very different. ILPs with ECI have started to emerge recently - where they cover an even greater range of CIs than most policies and it makes balancing investments, insurance, coverage range and budget exceedingly complicated. Even a veteran FA in the industry can't be expected to answer questions related straight away, but do they show you they value you by addressing your issue promptly? ‚Äã4) And lastly, the feels. ‚ÄãTrust me, the feels go a long way. And it's not just one way, it's on the FA side as well. ‚ÄãFor you, an FA can be perfect but if you don't FEEL like having a long term relationship with this infuriating character, it just might not be the right fit. ‚ÄãPersonally, I've experienced this and have tried not to take it personally the older I get in this industry. I've spent 3 hours with an auntie harping over the same issue before trying to explain that I'm not cursing her son every time I talk about insurance. Could she tell I was sincere? Sure. Did she think I was knowledgeable and putting in a lot of effort for her? Certainly. Did she think that we were going to get  along in the long term? Most definitely not. ‚ÄãSo on your end, that (4) can overwhelm the rest, and it's unfortunately worth considering as well.‚ÄãChoose an FA who you think will go an extra mile for you, even when they're on holiday. (heh)‚ÄãI usually leave an avenue to contact me, but how about you give your FA a second chance now that you've read this? :) ‚ÄãLuke ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã0 comments5"

Being a blogger in this realm, I met many good acquaintance who should be above average when it comes to being financial advisors. For myself, my luck have not been good. I think that sometimes we need luck to find a financial advisor that will be a good partner with you.But you can help yourself by elminating areas where you will come across advisors that are less competent, do not have good heart.Firstly, you must know to a certain extent what u need, why you need protection, what is out there. If you do not, most of advisors will try their luck to fleece you.This is regardless of whether they are tied or not. Most have an economic incentive to push their luck with you.You can try talking to those older and experience advisors but some of them will let their experience speak and overwhelmed you to trusting them with everything. I would be careful there.The opposite spectrum will be those that show you the hard numbers, how these numbers and plans help you.It's good to have mixture of the two above.I have 2 advisors leaving me and my first one uses his experience to overwhelm me without the numbers.What saved me was that I know to an extend the fundamentally right things to do. So I did  alright.If you were to choose, the ifa nowadays have a wider range of investments recommendation at their disposal. If the range is limited, no matter how great the agent is, she can only recommend inferior products. Let me know if I havent answered well.0 comments4"

7,"Colin LimLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 09 Oct 2018rarely advisors do proper fact finding, they recommend product straight away either by asking u simple questions like; u got what types of insurance or doing reviews and recommending products you might be lacking.
sometimes prospect as the above will be wtf when i do fact finding on all his or her finances. today i do financia planning, i need to know all the details so that i can see what value i can add on.my early years as an advisors; most common objection is my friends are in the insurance line. i let them know the pros and cons of buying from friends. i can tell u, normally u buy from a friend, you are buying what they recommend or you buy to support their biz.
alot of agencies leaders always ask the new advisors to sell to their warm market, reason is its easy, secondly which in the mind frame is when these new agent leave, all their clients will be with the company and the leader will always get the commission.whether u choose FA or tied agents or not, depend on you.0 comments0"

I decided to go with a multichannel advisor (or what we layman called IFA but I think there ain't really any independent FA around in SG so..) ‚ÄãMy friend recommended a AIA agent to me and this guy was pushing me to take up ILP while my point is to take up PA for vitality üòÇ.‚ÄãMet him, asked for his credentials; time pass by with him keep pushing ILP to me and me signing on the PA with him on the spot. Message him next day not to submit the details because good thing I spoke to my multi channel advisor first... There's a lot of clauses guy didn't mention and I felt weird even though he was sincere. CSI-ed him and found out he lied about his credentials as well.‚ÄãI'm not going to report him but I have already told him why frankly since he asked and should I see him in trouble some day I won't hesitate to add on evidences.. so I think apart from all the points that you all have mentioned, have to CSI your agent too! üòù4 comments0"
9,"See all 4 comments Charmaine Ng24 Aug 2018Thanks Low! I'll check in with you if I need help! üòâCharmaine Ng24 Aug 2018Yeah Alan, I actually print screen what I CSIed and send to my friend. Ask her double check all the claims the agent made. Lucky for her is she didn't actually need him to recommend or to manage as she already knows what she needs.. but the agent did send a msg to her to try and salvage the boat. Lol. Turns out this agent was recommended to her by another friend who apparently bought quite a few so now they're double checking all the policies to see whether it really meet their needs or just for the agent's commission."
10,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Aug 2018If you belong to the high networth, you definitely should expect only the best to serve you. To be very honest, any FAs will make sure to understand your situation fully since any plans you buy likely would give them enough ""meat"" (aka commission), hence they will do it for you without question.‚ÄãIf you do not belong to the high networth, do also do yourself a favour by letting them know your finance status. This is because time is money to FAs. If you are an FA, do you want to spend 2 hours doing a comprehensive review, but not adding value because the infomation given to you is not accurate and unable to provide value to the client at the same time? What if you are the client? Would you want a half-baked recommendation because there is nothing much for the FA to know to provide you with a solution?‚ÄãFor older agents, generally they have a lot more clients to service. Would that be a concern to you? Because they have less time to answer your queries. For younger agents, they may not be as experienced to handle your questions. They definitely would not be more efficient than older agents in terms of recommendations and claim experience. (so your the one that is giving them the chance to hone their skills).‚ÄãTo answer your questions on selection, this is what i have done for myself1) Are their knowledge much better than me?2) Can they answer my questions?3) Do they ask questions to uncover my needs too?4) Do they ask comprehensively?5) Do they check out exclusions, medical history etc etc?https://www.facebook.com/themotleyfool/videos/10157362093662796/?hc_ref=ARSy8bR47-pteX_c42GXFltTLsXwSUKJRHUEMRtsVGnjmisWiIVU9l0dM9WvrqeF3Yc&fref=gs&dti=1758792264412132&hc_location=group&xts%5B0%5D=68.ARA9l5NhZyeP3WSP_mbhQwzdKsUHmbp2mfdmi_tdzi0jzG6S6mRqy-n8TRGtmKZkKn4QDD7U5VflsNB7TaHr2iKNU_9AN4lSbjKnLsXz9SyHffwiVJiW8DI7FzES_hJ26_ue7czhYp2o&tn=FC-R‚ÄãFor Tied FAs and Independent FAs, do cover this question instead. https://seedly.sg/questions/is-an-independent-financial-advisor-better-than-one-working-with-an-insurance-company-say-prudential-do-they-have-vested-interests‚ÄãAlso this article https://dollarsandsense.sg/insurance-agent-vs-independent-financial-advisor-vs-personal-banker-difference/0 comments0"
