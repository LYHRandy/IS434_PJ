ProdigyUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Ezrewards for the win! :DSure, SimplyGo is easier to consolidate bills to one credit card but I enjoy the fun of collecting points from my rides on my Ezrewards app and score deals for Lazada, Food Republic, Starbucks...to name a few.All it takes is a little bit of your time but the reward is SO WORTH IT, try it out!Hope the above helps a little :)2 comments3"

3,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Jun 2019I would prefer simplygo. The amount of points required to redeem even one free old chang kee curry puff is alot.I take bus and mrt everyday, redeem 1 curry puff a month for 800 points, does not seem worth to me.I rather collect cashback and with the current simplygo promos, can earn back more than 1 curry puff worth.0 comments2"
4,"PatLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 24 Jun 2019If you are using a concession card, aka the orange one that has your uni on it, simplygo as ezrewards is not applicable for concession cards. Now, assuming you are on board with the various debit/credit cards available for students, maximise what you can get from each bank's Visa promotions. For me this is the easier option because you are not adding money to a ""prepaid"" card, you are spending as you go (+ can check transactions on the app and in the future the expenditure goes towards min. spending for bonus interest rates if you are on a multiplier acc).-Just use the concession card whenever you want to buy those concession passes for bus/train/hybrid! However, during this period of promotions, I like to think that simplygo is a good option to reap all the cashbacks and free rides :)If you are using a normal ezlink card, and you like to score deals, go for ezrewards~0 comments1"
5,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 24 Jun 2019Hi Vanessa!EZ-Rewards is more of a points/rewards system. After accumulating the points from your rides, you can use them to redeem various types of rewards. Check out this Seedly article for more info on the rewards you can redeem!SimplyGo makes traveling less troublesome as payment is directly credited to your credit/debit card. Therefore, there won't be a need for manual top-ups anymore. Check out this Seedly article about SimplyGo and the rewards you can get during the current promotion period!As a university student, I'm assuming you are using concession to travel. Between the rewards during the SimplyGo promotion period VS the cheaper fare rides from concession, I would say stick with concession and not switch to SimplyGo. There's only this much you can save from the cashback/rewards from the promotion period, afterwhich you would have to continue paying adult fare for your rides. Therefore, staying with your concession is best! But bear in mind that concessions do not qualify for EZ-rewards! It's a tradeoff between cheaper student fare, EZ-rewards & the ease from SimplyGo.Hope this was helpful! Happy traveling :-)0 comments1"

I am leaning more towards simplygo due to the convenience of not having to do topup at the topup machine. In terms of rewards wise, you will need to look at what rewards do you prefer.
If you prefer rewards that are seamless and automatic, then do switch to Simplygo as they are usually given as cashback, points, miles or rebates.
If you prefer the rewards from Ezrewards such as lazada, starbucks or food republic, then do use Ezlink for your transport instead. Wrote an article about Ezrewards benefits here too.  http://justbeingernest.blogspot.com/2018/02/ez-link-mobile-app.html0 comments0"
