2,"HC TangLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 May 2019If you have the time and love to DIY= Go for class to learn how to DIY self pick equity, the learning and practice  journey would also takes few years. If you have no time weekly to self study , learn to invest and do much of it and learn about all the nature , pros and cons. = Go with other invest tools such as ETF , Robo advisor with monthly contribution to achieve DCA ( Dollat Cost Savings). These requires beginning research only for a shorter time frame as week few months at most. Either way both need to learn to invest. Its a journey. All the best ! Happy Investmenting! ðŸ˜ƒ0 comments0"
