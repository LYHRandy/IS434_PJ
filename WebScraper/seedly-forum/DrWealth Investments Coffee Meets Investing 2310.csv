1,"Chris ChinLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 11 Mar 2019Really depends on your position size or investment into that particular underlying stock and your investment target (short term, medium term or long term). 
Buy below Valuation. 
Can set a target at 3 years and sell as planned,regardless of profit or loss. 
Valuation details - please attend the paid class to find out. Otherwise, why would my friends pay to find out when they can get it free from seedly...  ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£0 comments0"
2,"Bang HongLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 20 Jul 2018No idea on Dr Wealth buy or sell formula, personally I depends on TA and news (FA) to make a decision on purchase.â€‹When to cut loss? When it cross your boundaries, some set the cut loss at 15% of purchase price, some actually average out. Personally I am against ""average out"" unless you have high confidence and certain that the stock will go up. (Take for example Singtel at 3.0x at one point in time recently, this is a stock that people will buy)0 comments0"
