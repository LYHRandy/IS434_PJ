Look at list of items that has tariffs on them. Besides that, also consider how big an impact it is to China and whether other SE Asia countries stand to gain from this.Having said so, US stocks has been soaring for the past couple of months but at the expense of other countries. Main thing is to try to uncover undervalued stocks that suffered from this trade war, and if you see potential in them recovering in the long term, place your bets.0 comments0"
