question,"SeedlyTV EP03 Family Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 Apr 2019How to talk to my boyfriend about finances without stressing him out?My boyfriend just started working a few months ago, and he knows that it's important to plan and save, but he has not looked into his finances, or plan his saving goals or done any budgeting. Whenever I try to talk about this with him or show him how I do track my finances, he will say that I'm pressurising him. How can I get him to be more receptive? Or how long should I give him to be ""ready"" to adult?8 answersAnswerBump2"

1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 22 Apr 2019It‚Äôs often a scary step for many to start talking about their finances and do something about it. Many of my clients are similar. Try to understand your boyfriend fears and support him to take actions. 
You may want to understand why he finds it pressurising (as everyone has different reason)For example, many may find it pressurising because it is such a big, technical and complicated topic. Hence it is important to help them KISS it (keep it simple and Stupid)Eventually, one has to face the fact to be in charge of their financial future after all.P.S. I wrote a Marie Kondo inspired article on Finance, perhaps it can help your boyfriendhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marie-kondo-might-able-help-tidy-up-your-finances-clarence-chua0 comments4"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Apr 2019At least he knows it is important to plan and save!With all things, he probably needs to come around to it himself. And besides, I guess you want to avoid him thinking you are nagging, and shut off once you mention money. That said, you can tell him straight up: you know it's important to save. What are your financial goals ie. How much do you want in your bank and investment portfolio, and by what date?That will set him thinking. The other way is to talk about finances for yourself for eg. How you are saving more by cooking more often, cutting down on restaurants etc. Then the focus is not so much on him, but you will pique his interest since he is already looking to plan and save.0 comments2"
3,"Tee Hon EngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 22 Apr 2019You may wish to approach it using a bigger picture.What you would like to achieve financially? For example, housing or retirement.Do you and your boyfriend have intention to achieve that common goal together?If so, set a minimum standard for him. (You need to have minimum portfolio of $XXXk by age XX)Express that you have no intention to compromise. (E.g. you will not sponsor more than XX% of your common goal)Find out what is comfortable for both of you.If both of you is willing to work towards that common goal, that's good. He can work out how to achieve his part on his own, try to ease on macro-managing the money.You can proceed to casually interest him in opportunities. (E.g. Investment, Savings, Lifestyle) ""You can earn interest of $XX/ save $XX by switching to this savings account/ household choice, do you think it is worth it?""0 comments2"
4,"SWShaun Wq LimLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 26 Apr 2019It‚Äôs an emotional thing. Let him know that you will break up with him after 6 months if he doesn‚Äôt get his stuff together. Until he feels it and put it in perspective, he will not take action.During the 6 months, you will offer your all to help him achieve it. And if after 6 months, he doesn‚Äôt do anything. He wasn‚Äôt worth your time.(Speaking from my own personal and painful experience)0 comments1"
5,"Cherie Tan, üèÖFinancial Consultant at Prudential Assurance SingaporeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 05 Jun 2019Hi there! It's perfectly common when partners share that they feel pressured whenever the other partner talks about finances.I found that empathizing with your partner is the first step to helping him open up about finances. He could be feeling intimidated, or inferior, compared to you, either because you're earning more or simply because you look like you're being the responsible one that he may not feel adequate yet to step into.You could start with empathizing with him, sharing with him how you first begun, your initial worries about finances and savings. Perhaps you too, felt inadequate, unprepared, or doubtful at some point. By relating yourself and putting yourself in his shoes, it tells him that you care very much about him.Bridge the conversation into talking about the bigger, common goals you dream of working towards together with him. By taking the initiative and talking about common goals and dreams, it helps your partner feel more comfortable and at ease as well, especially if he does intend to spend the next phase of his life with you.Sometimes, having a third person in this conversation can help. A good financial planner is also highly experienced in handling such conversations, to help both parties feel at ease while steering the conversation into fruitful outcomes for you and your partner.Please feel free to contact me via https://cherietan.typeform.com/to/wdlOfu or at LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/cherietanjy!0 comments0"
6,"Cindy TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 16 May 2019I think its a good start that he knows it's important to plan and save. If he is already doing that, and is not receptive to your words. I think you should let him be, he probably will come around when he is ready. Afterall, he only started working for a few months, give him some time.0 comments0"

9,"SOSj Oh24 Apr 2019Start opening a high interest savings account , and show him the power of compounding ! And explain to him that the little interest can cover some expenses in life.

Attend free events by sgx first and slowly learn together. Ensure that the journey in personal finances is together not, with a single person facing as one"
