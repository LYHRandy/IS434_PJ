1,"JeanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 02 Mar 2019Hello! I do believe that we need CI coverage on top of hospital plan because, should you stop working, your income will drop while your expenses will undeniably rise (not referring to treatment expenses). These are just some considerations: 
In order to recover, how long will you stop working for? 
Who is going to fund for these expenses? Savings? Family? 
Will the quality of your lifestyle drop because you have insufficient funds?0 comments0"
