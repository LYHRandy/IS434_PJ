1,"Eugene WeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 21 Feb 2019I think the articles written on Seedly well explains the purpose of having an ETF in your portfolio compared to picking individual stocks. Assuming you're only selecting ETFs, having this in your portfolio will be useful should you choose to retire in SG. Unless you're willing to devote a lot of your time picking stocks and chasing gains, a fuss free method of ""playing the market"" will be ETfs. My current allocation will be 110-my age for percentage in stocks and the remaining for bonds. With the percentage set for stocks, I've diversifited it half into SG markets and half into World markets. Hope it helps!0 comments1"
