Seems pretty accurate, I didn't really scrutinize it.But I'm sure you can find a better loan than 2.88% p.a. That's way too high. Try again with a conservative 2.1% p.a mortgage rate.But even then, such a high quantum for a non guaranteed 15% markup over 3 years? What's the point? And as you can see you're right, after levies and fees to the agent to help sell the property, it makes barely any sense.There are 3-year endowment plans giving 2.3+% p.a guaranteed for 3 years.3 comments1"
