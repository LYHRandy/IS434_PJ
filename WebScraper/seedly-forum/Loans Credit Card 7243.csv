1,"Tee-Ming ChewLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Jun 2018Don't really have experience with this but here is what I found:​Debt Consolidation Plan (DCP)Mr Anthony Seow, head of cards and unsecured loans at DBS Bank, said: ""In most scenarios, you would also have a lower monthly instalment amount to repay compared to managing different accounts individually. For example, someone without DCP would likely be paying around 3 per cent of their total outstanding on a monthly basis at an effective interest rate in excess of 20 per cent per annum. ""With DCP, the monthly repayment would be around 2 per cent of their total outstanding and at an effective interest rate in excess of 10 per cent a year onwards.""​Source: https://www.straitstimes.com/business/deep-in-debt-theres-help​Hope that helps!0 comments0"
