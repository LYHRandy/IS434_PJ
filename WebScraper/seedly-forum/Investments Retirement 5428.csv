1,"Victor Lye, Founder & CEO at SquirrelSaveLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Sep 2019Investing requires you setting your risk appetite and your time horizon. Once you set these, just invest. There is no good or bad time. The best is to start as early as possible in your life so that you maximise the ability to ride the ups and downs of markets. Get emotions out of investing.0 comments3"

God of WisdomAnswered on 18 Sep 2019If you're intending to invest money every month without fail, then it doesn't matter when you start. Just keep investing and stay invested. Because if markets do pull back and there's a recession, it's a sale and you should be investing even more.So you can always start anytime as long as you are not trying to time the market and you have a long enough investment horizon (5 years).0 comments2"
