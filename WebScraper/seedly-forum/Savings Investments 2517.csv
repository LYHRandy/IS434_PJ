1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 May 2019It really depends on the DCA fees. Also there are some considerations.assuming your investment can make 6% p.a, while fees take up 1%, you gain overall 5%.compare to you need 1 year to lump sum, but the fees are 0.25%. Though you may miss out on some down period. Your gains may be 5.5%. In this way, you are not gaining much too.most people who opt for DCA try to keep to a certain percentage of fees (or minimum transaction sum), hence it make sense as Long as the fees are not over 1% (roughly double of lump sum)0 comments0"
2,"Benny TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 04 Mar 2019That's a valid consideration. DCA is a strategy and makes no consideration as to the costs of investment, and as such it's important if one follows it to find the cheapest way to do so. A variant is for someone to buy in at longer intervals which 'match' the minimum cost of investing.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019If you dont have lump sum straight away and invest part of monthly salary, thats what most people do. If you hold the money for too long to accumulate it to become a lump sum, it just sits there and do hardly anything. You could lose out on the potential gains. If you have a lump sum straight off the bat to invest, by all means do lump sum.0 comments0"
