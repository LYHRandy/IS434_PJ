1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 16 Jun 2019This is indeed one of the biggest 'hacks' and 'recommendations in today's working adult world to contribute and top up your CPF SA for higher interest rates. TL;DR: It‚Äôs all about 2.5% vs 4.0%Essentially this act of topping up the SA account is about your retirement funds and allowing it to compound at a faster rate of 4% to 5% p.a risk-free rate.By doing this action:It locks up your money with the CPF Special Account till age 55You are unable to use this money for property, education or CPF approved investments (normally from your OA)WARNING: You cannot reverse this action and take out the funds!Thus by going by the above illustration, the people who should do that are people who:Are willing to lock up their funds till 55 years oldAre likely single and plan to stay single (with no kids for education)Do not plan to buy any property using your CPF OA (housing)Hope this helps :)You can read more about this topic in a blog post I wrote some time back also: https://blog.seedly.sg/should-you-transfer-cpf-oa-to-sa/1 comment10"

3,"Vivien Lee FengLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 15 Jun 2019This is good for those who do not intend to use CPF to pay housing loan, insurance premiums, children‚Äôs education and investment. In my opinion, if you ultimately decided to transfer, it would be good to leave some money in OA for emergency use. eg in case you have cash flow problem and need to use cpf to pay for housing loan.0 comments6"
4,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 19 Jun 2019Transferring from OA to SA is irreversible. Only do this if you are comfortable to lock up OA funds till age 55 because you cannot use funds in SA for any purpose at the moment other than some investments. So only if you do not intend to use OA monies for a property, investment, education, and want that extra 1.5% interest, sure go ahead.If not, keep it in OA.1 comment6"
5,"Eleanor Ng Lai Hong19 Jun 2019You can only do voluntary top up to SA n MS subject to cap. Contribution to OA can only be done via employmt or voluntary contribution (eg if you are self employed) and this contribution will be allocated to all 3 accts ie OS, SA n  MS. The % allocatn is age dependent."
6,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Jun 2019If I remember correctly, the transfer is non reversible. If you think you will be using the money in your OA, just leave it there.SA is mainly for retirement. This option will not be relevant to you, since you are still young. You should consider it after you‚Äôve gotten your commitments in place and know if you can afford to not use your CPF for any future purchases.A better option will be to top up your OA account, especially if you are planning to buy a place in future. This allows some tax relieve, though the amount might not be critical if you belong to the lower tax tier.0 comments5"

8,"Ryan PhamLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 18 Jun 2019In my own opinion, I wouldnt transfer the money to SA unless you have settled the basics.
So whats the basics?
1. Buy a house (Dont need to buy condo or too big a place but at least buy one as a Singaporean, thats the best way to utilize our CPF money.) Have 6-12 months liquidity in your OA to cover your mortgage just in case you get out of job. Look at CPFIS equity counters, there are alot of bluechips or Reits that return good dividends above 4% as well. Granted that the price is not guaranteed but I would buy GIC linked companies with good economic moats.  https://api2.sgx.com/sites/default/files/2019-01/Stocks%20Under%20CPF%20Investment%20Scheme_1.pdf Singapore Government Bonds - There are some that is  returning 3.x% see if that can be used by CPF.
Once you covered those, then I think it make sense to put money in the SA.
I dont advocate putting all your eggs into one basket and also having such a long time before you can take your money.0 comments3"
9,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 15 Jun 2019For your situation, I will not recommend doing so. Because you have not bought your first property, you should set aside funds in your OA so that you will be able to utilize them in your first property purchase. And every transfer is irrerversible. I believe the only time you should do the transfer is when you bought your first home, and your mortgage monthly installment is able to cover fully by your CPF OA. Hence, if you have any excess out of it, transfer those that you want into SA to build your retirement funds.0 comments3"
10,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 12 Jun 2019Sadly, OA to SA is a one way trip.One must make sure that there is no other need for the OA before moving it.4% interest in SA is very attractive but you cannot touch it till at least 55 years old.Property and HDB will need your OA unless you can pay the deposits and loan by cash.0 comments3"
11,"Germaine ChongLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 15 Jun 2019You can consider transferring if you do not intend to use your OA.OA can be used for ‚Äãhousing, insurance,¬†investment and education. Note that this action cannot be reversed. Hope it helps.1 comment2"

13,"Ernest Yeam Wee LeongLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 19 Jun 2019I do it every month and the amount i transfer from OA to SA is basically the amount that is below the hundreds of my OA.eg. if my OA is $18,532, i transfer $32 from my OA to SA so that my OA looks nicer as $18,500.Cause i am looking to get a house in the near future and having money in the OA is crucial.1 comment1"
14,"Eleanor Ng Lai Hong19 Jun 2019If it is risk free 4% which cpfsa is currently getting which appeals to you  i would do  cash top up. This way, i benefit from additional tax relief or i would top up my MS. Once MS is max to current cap $57.2k, contribution due to MS will then be pour over to my SA. All these are assuming you do hv the liquidity at hand."
15,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 26 Jun 2019OA can be used for education and housing. On the other hand, SA is solely meant for retirement. The transfer is one-way and cannot be revoked. As such, funds in OA are more liquid compared to SA. A good rule of thumb would be to ask yourself if you need the liquidity?I am also in a situation similar to yours, and I opted to transfer about 10k from my OA to SA so as to take advantage of the bonus interest(4+1%) :)0 comments0"

No.Not enough inform from you to give a more accurate sharing.Here is my sharing if I got the money.In 2006 I have spare cash of $108,000 about 20% of $535,000 price of a 2 bedroom condo in D7.Calculate how much will I get now if I put the $108,000 into SA now.My condo now can sell for $1,550,000. with a rent income of $4,000.1 comment0"

19,"Beng Kuan SohLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 19 Jun 2019If you think enough for future in OA based on monthly contribution projection, suggest putting at SA to fulfill FRS. You cannot top up more in SA as the amount is restricted to only the FRS level advised for the current year, which is projected to be increased at $5000 yearly. That means if current year FRS is at $170,000, you can only top up till that amount. Once FRS reached, you no longer have to top up anymore as with the interest (4%) is already self sustaining to cover the increment of $5000 per year unless Govt policy for FRS changes.3 comments0"
20,"See all 3 comments Hariz Arthur Maloy19 Jun 2019You mean FRS not BRS. From the 170k you mentioned, I know you mean FRS. Just got the terms mixed up.Beng Kuan Soh19 Jun 2019Thanks all for pointing the mistake. Yeah, mixed up the terms. Have corrected them. Cheers."
21,"Wilfred HOLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 17 Jun 2019No, money from OA to SA is one way. But I still did it. Every year, I would move 50% of my OA to SA. No trouble paying for my housing loan with the remaining 50% left in my OA.0 comments0"
22,"Low Yong HanLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 17 Jun 2019I‚Äôll recommend topping up in small amounts of about SGD 500 per year or more based on a % of your annual CPF OA contributions i.e. 3%. I‚Äôm doing the former.
Assuming you are below 35 years old, your CPF contribution is 37% of your income (20% from your own salary and additional 17% from your employer).
Breaking it down further:23% of your monthly pay goes into OA6% to SA8% to medisaveThis will ensure that there‚Äôs a balanced approach to achieving both the benefits of higher interest in your SA and accumulating funds in your OA for your housing and education needs.0 comments0"
23,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Jun 2019On the flip side I would recommend not doing the transfer. The cost of housing is long up and the lump sum down payment can be huge. If you transfer the money you might not have enough to pay for the initial down payment.
This is especially so so if you are single and plan to buy a condo
If you are living with parents and housing is not an issue, you might consider transfering0 comments0"
24,"Ronald SzieLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 17 Jun 2019I will think rather than transferring a large sum to SA, transferring the rounding amount (e.g. $12345 to $12000) to SA regularly can help to achieve higher interest. Will not impact your funds for future home purchases but set aside some amount to retirement. Also the earlier you start the higher interest you will earn too.0 comments0"
