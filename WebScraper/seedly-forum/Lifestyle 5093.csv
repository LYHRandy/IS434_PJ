1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Used to pay for Spotify's monthly subscription at $9.90 per month to skip the annoying advertisements and play the songs that I want to hear, especially when I travel overseas so that I can download the songs and listen offline while I'm on the plane. Now, I'm back to using the free version and will only pay for Premium again when I'm going to travel overseas. 1 comment2"
