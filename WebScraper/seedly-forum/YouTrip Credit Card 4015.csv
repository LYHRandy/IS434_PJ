GeniusAnswered on 28 Jul 2019Most local banks would exclude such transactions (Prepaid / Stored Value cards) for Miles or Cashback; maybe you can consider using OCBC Cashflo for Free 3/6 months installment?0 comments4"
2,"NNNicholas NbxLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 23 Aug 2019So far I saw YouTrip is specifically excluded from Citibank and UOB card. But it worked for Standard Chartered Unlimited Cashback. I've tried and gotten 1.5% cashback on all my YouTrip top-ups with that card, at least at the of time of this post. Hope it helps!0 comments1"
3,"Chin Guo QiangLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 09 Jun 2019I personally use DBS SAFRA Credit Card as with $500 credit card spending comes a basic 3% cashback rebates, in the form of SAFRA$. Which can be used to offset credit card bill payments or redeem for Singapore Airlines (SQ) KrisFlyer Miles (not a good ratio though).Hope this helps. :)1 comment0"
