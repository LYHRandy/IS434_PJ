1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 18 May 2019Aside from reading, think about how to apply lessons that you have observed in leaders you admire. Ultimately, you would develop your own style. Like many things, being a good leader takes practice. Look at listening to your team. Identify the best traits in each team member, and build out the team accordingly. Lead by example. The team would look at how you look to resolve conflict and solve problems. It's one thing to be well-liked because you're friendly with your team, and another to make hard decisions that might make you unpopular. 0 comments0"
