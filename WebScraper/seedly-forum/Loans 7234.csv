1,"Png Cheng Xi DamienLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Aug 20182 things to consider - size of loan and EIR on the loan.​If you have a small loan which you can pay off immediately, clear that first. Your credit score will be affected by how many oustanding loan accounts you have. The psychological effect of having one less loan to service may help you alleviate some stress.​Also, try to clear the high EIR ones asap. This is after paying the min. each month for every loan (late fees will almost always be higher than interests unless the amount is very high).0 comments0"
2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Aug 2018There are many methods to repay your loan. Notably the 2 most commonly use are the Debt Avalanche (highest interest rate paid off first, and minimum for the rest) vs Debt snowball (paying off the smallest debt first).​Mathematically speaking however, repay the loan with the highest Effective Interest Rate first. (The one that charges you a lot more interest than others). > aka Debt avalanche method.​So based on General interest rates, the order should be something along the lines of ​1) Credit Card debts. 20-26% p.a. Craziest debts of all. People may wish to take a personal loan instead to settle this ASAP.​2) Unsecured Loans (Like personal loans and other lower amounts of interest rates... around 8-14%)​3) Secured Loans (housing loans, student loans etc)​However, please have the disciple, or look for http://www.ccs.org.sg/need-help/page/frequently-asked-questions Credit Counselling Singapore to help you resolve your debts.0 comments0"
3,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 May 2018Great question! If you exclude key factors like the deadline of the debts, you should prioritise them base on the interest rate. The reason is because the higher the interest rate of the debt, the more interest amount you have to pay in the end.​Hope this helps!0 comments0"
