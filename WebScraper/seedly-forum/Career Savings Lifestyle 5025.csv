3,"Devanshi Singh, Investment Planner, Writer, Adviser  at Financial Advisory ServicesLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 12 Dec 2018My mother saves money in every way possible but her motive is not to just save money but to have a mind and ways ''how to earn money''. She says anyone can take your money from you but if you learn the method how you can earn money(and of course in legitimate ways) nobody can take it from you unless you give them willingly.She struggled all life because she got married to not that rich family (though she belonged to a rich family, my father is amazing).She never asked for money from her parents and she learned ways to make money and save money.Now she has two houses,  3 vehicles including one car and much more.Another one I  love is from Mr. Warren BuffetRule No. 1 Never lose money Rule no. 2 Remember rule no. 10 comments0"
