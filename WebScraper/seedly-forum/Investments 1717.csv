1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Strictly comparing these 2 asset classes, I'd go for the HYB. REITs are as sensitive to interest rates but property is an illiquid holding. A REIT manager can't just decide to sell of some buildings or lower their gearing as and when.HYB funds do better at active management to respond to interest rates, also bonds are much more liquid and the entire bond market even eclipses the entire equity market. Plus HYB funds are usually cheaper than REITs as well. To start investing in a high yield bond fund, you'll need a minimum of 1k however.2 comments2"
2,"Benjamin Seah06 Apr 2019I see.. Does that mean that my portfolio as of now would fully consist of HYB funds? Are there any other types of investment strategies that you would recommend?Hariz Arthur Maloy06 Apr 2019Well I hope not. They're a good component of an overall portfolio but should never be the highlight. I'll limit HYB or property to about 10-15% of my overall portfolio or half of my entire fixed income allocation. If this is your first investment, I suggest setting up a global diversified portfolio through an FA or a Robo Advisor."
3,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Apr 2019High yield bonds are better because they have lower volatility for around the same yield. The answer given below by Zann also applies more to individual bonds, not bond funds and especially not bond funds. Bond values are not fixed - especially with active management, the duration can be managed effectively so that you always get a higher compounded return. To be fair, what can happen is that some High Yield Bond Funds 'cheat' by holding some REITs anyway. So you may want to just invest in high yield bond funds. You can see an example listed above, which gives between 7 - 8% dividends.0 comments0"
4,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019Hello!I would personally prefer to invest in REITs.This is because inflation is likely to reduce the bond owner's buuing power. Since the bond investment is fixed at the value at which it is purchased, inflation is likely to eat away your return. While for REITs, inflation driving up the price of housing may move more people into the rental market. This increasing demand may raise rents and profits.Another reason would be that bond values are fixed while REITs shares can incerase. REITs that are operating efficiently can increase their profits through good management or increased rents with higher demand.0 comments0"
