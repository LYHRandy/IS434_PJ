WonderkidAnswered on 22 Mar 20191) Get your salary credited to one of the many higher interest savings accounts available.2) Consider placing some of your emergency savings into the Singapore Savings Bond3) If you are planning to return to your home country/to another country at some stage (& that is a higher tax jurisdication than Singapore), look at what tax advantage options are available which you could benefit from by being offshore.4) Start saving for your retirement as most companies in Singapore do not have a pension plan for their expat employees, so the onus is on you to do that.0 comments0"
