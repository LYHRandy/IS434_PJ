I will start with a simple one:​Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)An ETF is a passively managed investment fund which is traded on the stock marketPassively managed because it just tracks the index (for example, buys the top 30 companies based on a certain allocation) hence lower feesTraded on stock market indicates that it has high liquidity of buyers and sellers, which is a good thing for investorsYou can actually read more about one of the more common ETFs bought in Singapore the STI ETF: Singapore's leading index fund.​Here: https://blog.seedly.sg/how-to-sti-etf-a-simple-way-to-invest-in-singapores-top-30-companies/0 comments1"
