question,"Salary Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Jun 2019How can I approach my manager to discuss with them about salary matters?I'm earning 2.8k/mth after working for 2.5 years, this would be my 1st job. I had an interview and was offered (but they didn't mention salary). My asking is 3.8k and they said it was too high. I've a 2.7 mths guranteed bonus on my current job. Average my current pay would be around 3.37k including bonus. So my next job should be more than 3.3k. How do i approach this, to let them know that cause my bonus is good, the salary given should not be based on my current salary?5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 30 Jun 2019Always negotiate your salary with annual pay. When they rejected your 3.8k, did they counter offer you? If they did work from there too.The Industry, the company and the position you are applying for matters too. MNCs are normally able to offer more too, you want to apply for them if you want0 comments3"

God of WisdomUpdated on 29 Jun 2019Tell them your annual pay instead.We should negotiate like the americans and ask an annual pay instead of a monthly one because that would include bonuses.0 comments2"
3,"SShieleenLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 29 Jun 2019Perhaps you can ask what’s the best offer, or benchmark against market rate.It’s curious imo why a $1k jump is justifiable/reasonable in your opinion? Highlight strong examples of achievement why you’re worth that price tag after just 2.5 years in your 1st job. Companies could package compensation and benefits differently, is there no other factor(s) to consider as well? The company could offer an amount and then increase it after probation, annual increment etc.0 comments0"
4,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 28 Jun 2019Just a suggestion here, you should let them know how much you're getting currently including the guaranteed bonus. And help them by justifying why you deserve a better pay (I.e. minimum $3.5k in your case) - is it the network that you're bringing to the company or your portfolio and experience?Affordability and returns are key drive factors to salary negotiation (from the employer's point of view).0 comments0"
5,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 28 Jun 2019Always negotiate around annual compensation - that way to take the end of year bonus into account.
Also if you have been offered already, then there should be some space for negotiation. So do give them a counter-offer, but this time stating annual compensation.0 comments0"
