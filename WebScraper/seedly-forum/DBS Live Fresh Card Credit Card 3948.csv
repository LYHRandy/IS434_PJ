God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoAlthough I don't hold any DBS cards, you can waive the fee online via  https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/card-waive-credit-card-cashline-charges.html  If that doesn't work, calling in and asking for a waiver will usually work. Banks are usually quite generous in waiving the fee, provided that you have been paying off your bills in full.0 comments5"
