ProdigyAnswered on 17 Dec 2018If I am you, I will follow my boss and try to defer.Work comes first unless my country is on a crisis or it is a particular important training that missing it will have an impact (i.e. joining other company for training and not with my fellow friends).Always try to align with your boss as long term basis you will have a happier life in the workforce. Some will say right/wrong, morale stuff, etc. It is your choice.Personal recommendation: Try to align with your boss if possible unless something ""major"".0 comments0"

Have a word with hr if there is such a policy available. If not, I'd suggest the same Tat Tian - walk away. No point having such an environment in the work place and let this conflict affect your own performance 0 comments0"
