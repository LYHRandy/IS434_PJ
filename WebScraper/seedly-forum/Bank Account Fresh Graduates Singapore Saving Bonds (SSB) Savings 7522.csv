question,"Bank Account Fresh Graduates Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Nov 2018Quick survey: How much do you set aside for your emergency fund (including discretionary spending)?Trying to get a gauge here.I'm a fresh grad with around $15,000 savings currently, earning $2k/mth. I spend around $900-$1100 per mth, excluding holidays.Was initially aiming to grow my emergency fund to $25,000 (kept in SSB & DBS Multiplier). Not sure if this emergency fund target is a bit too kiasu for my age? I.e. I'm better off investing a larger portion, instead of prioritising this savings goal.Don't expect any big ticket expenses coming up, except maybe 1 x $2k holiday each year.1 answerAnswerBump0"
