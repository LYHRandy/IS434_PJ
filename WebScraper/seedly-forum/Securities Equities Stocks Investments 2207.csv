WizardAnswered on 14 Mar 2019I suppose for a start, you could find out why the stock is undervalued in the first place.For example, during a recession or market correction, the negative sentiment could cause investors to lose sentiment in the market, which can cause them perceive stocks as cheaper than they really are. This phenomenon could also occur in industries that are cyclical, such as the semi-conductor industry. Investors may believe that the stocks are overvalued, when in essence the stocks are just going through a cycle. This gives value investors a good chance to take advantage when the industry moves into another phase of the cycle.Another way to identify undervalued stocks is to compare certain ratios or multiples with a company's peers. For example, you could look at a company's P/E ratio and compare that with its peers to see if it is trading lower than the industry's averages. Lastly, another way is to identify certain trends or growth opportunities that you believe that the market has not taken note of.0 comments0"
