Grand MasterUpdated on 18 Sep 2019How much have you spent on your laptop/desktop?How much time do you use your laptop/desktop?It's normal to spend abt $1.5k to $2k (even $3k for those who need a fast laptop) on a proper laptop for studies or work.You probably spend more time on your phone than on a laptop (or tablet).Going by usage by hours in your life, are you sure that item is expensive?I just want to spend as little time as I could in charging/ maintaining/repair/downtime and please please no lag on a phone I spend hours on it for work and leisure.I stopped telco's contracts years ago, opting for a basic plan, and buying my phones directly, hence saving money by cutting off telco tied plans. And a great ""expensive"" phone usually last me 4-5 years. I was using my wife's old phone (because she decided her android phone battery life is ridiculous and she switched to iPhone) for extra 1-2 more years before I too switched to a newer phone.Whatever you spend, think of how long it can last you, I think it would be reasonable if you plan to use it for a longer time than a cheap phone that gets replaced earlierPS: its more environmentally friendly to use a phone for as long as you can too!1 comment5"

WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2019One could argue that it's because of the latest functionalities but TBH, phone technology improvements have been marginally incremental.The real reason: it gives a signal of wealth and status simply because they're expensive. Additionally, if you want to show off, you want to be the first to get your hands on it. When everyone else on the street has the same phone, then it's not as cool anymore.
And the phone companies know it. Which is why they want to entice consumers to change their phones more frequently than they really need to.0 comments4"

ProdigyUpdated on 17 Sep 2019Sometimes I feel that it's just a status symbol now since there's nothing spectacular between releases.But to be honest, Apple's ecosystem is really pretty solid, it is super easy to transfer any information between your iPhone and whichever Mac you're using. I don't have one myself, but I've also heard that the Apple Watch is one of the best, so it supports a seamless lifestyle. It helps that the products are really intuitive and user-friendly, at least for me.Like Cedric mentioned, Apple products can last quite a while. Even though I've recently switched to the Google Pixel 'cus I couldn't stomach the crazy iPhone prizes, I'm definitely waiting to see how well my Pixel can serve me in the long run.Another thing I realised is that iPhone's resale prices are generally higher than other brands, which might be a factor for some people?0 comments3"
5,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2019It's quite hard to compare iPhone and Macbook in my opinion. My personal take is that they serve different use case and will definitely invest the money on both since I spend most of my time (work and personal) on both the devices.I will instead compare - iPhone vs Android phones (personal view):iOS apps are generally better built and companies usually focus more on iOS than Android (at least in Singapore)iPhone has better resale value than most of the Android phones. Largely because of the demand for itApple products tend to last longer from my personal experienceComfortable and being part of the Apple eco-system. Seamless integration with Apple Watch, Macbook will make your life easier!0 comments2"
6,"Ronald SzieLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 4w agoIt is a symbol of wealth to use an iPhone since celebrities and billionaires use them too. It's the closest you can get to look rich.Ironically it's the cheapest among the other types of symbols of wealth, comparing to Ferraris, LV, Gucci or Rolex. Imagine paying $1.6K to be in the ranks of celebrities, it's a steal. And you have the bragging rights until the next iPhone launch too.0 comments0"
7,Kelly TrinhLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 Sep 2019The same reason why people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on sports cars for the core functionality (getting from A to B). It is the same as a cheap car but the key part would be showing-off-your-income status symbolism!0 comments0

Still using the iPhone 7 I got at a lucky draw 2 years back, even though it has a crack across the screen.Bought a laptop last year for $1200 and regretting it now. Should have bought a surface pro instead. Itâ€™s more practical for work.0 comments0"

WizardUpdated on 19 Sep 2019Not necessary spending 1.6k, some stuck with old telco contract plan so slightly cheaper overall vs no contract sim only plan + buy at carousell / retailer at 1.6k or slightly lessor.The main reason:Apple internal doc shows their phone lasts 4 years. My friend had a few models used more than 4 years, or an iPhone 4 still working quite alright now compare to any android phone that is more than 8 years ago.Apple app store has better quality and build, the whole OS is more stable and consistently design, most of all the OS and app store lock user in for its seamless connections for data/information flow among all the apple products.The more that is in the Tech sector in tech design will know:IOS is more secure than Android (not without bugs/loophole). Face ID is way ahead and secure than any Android facial recognitions hardware on the smartphone.Its battery capacity degrades slower after 2 years of use than Android which is about 1 year.Indeed many android manufacturer provides better hardware than Apple, better features. However, Apple is a consistent design from hardware to software, everything control tightlight and works tightly, with it's A series process that is actually 2 to 3 generations ahead of all Android processor, more power-efficient and usage of less RAM (where android always need to bundle now with at least above 4GB RAm to work smoothly while Apple due to better OS memory handlings, requires less than 4GB RAM to work smooths and every generations faster than any similar range Android hardware that has even better hardware). I can go on and on and I'm not Apple fanatics, I have many complains about Apple but in general, Apple still produces a better overall product, for many years since day 1 where they invented touch screen smartphone with app store that actually works for users from 2-year-old kid to 90 years old man. So I guess we're stuck...lol0 comments0"

11,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 20191) There are bundle offers from telcos that allow the user to recontract yearly to get the newest iPhone at a discount
2) Sell off the older iPhones earlier retails greater value than using it for two years
with a combination of point 1 and 2, you see iPhones switching hands yearly0 comments0"

I am actually stuck now in the whole Apple eco-system also.I have quite a few of their products which work really well together and it's optimised around productivity and User experience :)iPhone 8 plusMacbook ProAirPodsThe seamlessness between the macbook and the iPhone really works wonders when it comes to file sharing (airDrop) and also iCloud, backups (Time machine) etc.0 comments0"
