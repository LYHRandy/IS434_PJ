For example, UOB Lady‚Äôs, UOB Visa Signature, UOB Preferred Platinum Visa, UOB PRVI. On a side note, Citibank points/miles do not pool! If you have Citi PM and Citi Rewards, you need to pay twice $25 for miles redemption and each min redemption is 10k miles.For offline shopping, UOB Lady‚Äôs Card offers 4 mpd (cap at $1k spending) provided it is chosen as one of the 7 categories. UOB Preferred Platinum Visa also offers 4 mpd (cap at $1k spending) using PayWave if the store accepts this payment method.For online shopping, UOB Preferred Platinum Visa also offers 4 mpd (cap at $1k spending) when you shop at Lazada, Shopee, Taobao, and etc‚Ä¶For travel, if you have UOB Lady‚Äôs Card you can also change the chosen category once every quarter to the ‚ÄúTravel‚Äù category to earn 4 mpd on hotel and flight bookings. Note that the same cap $1k spend applies. UOB PRVI can also net you 6 mpd on hotel and flight bookings if you book through their portal ‚ÄúUOB Travel‚Äù. For general expenditure, UOB PRVI offers a respectable 1.4 mpd (local) / 2.4 (overseas), second-best in the market. You also need to note that UOB awards points/miles in blocks of $5. Meaning if you spend $4.99, no points for you. These are all my personal suggestions since you mentioned you hope to pool points together. Hope you find them useful! üòä0 comments1"
