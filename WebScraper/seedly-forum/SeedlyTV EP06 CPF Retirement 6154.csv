1,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Jun 2019According to CPF website, you will see minimum sum increasing by $5k per year base on track record. If you are 30 this year and when you reach 55, the amount of $176,000 will balloon to $301,000 for FRS. https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-scheme0 comments1"

WizardUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Yeah likewise from what we observe.I actually did a simple calculation of how much we would likely need by the time we grow up (for a 27 year old individual) today.It will definitely rise, due to:InflationIncreasing cost of livingPeople living older (life expectancy)TL;DR: For A 27 year old, you will probably need around $316k in your CPF before you can withdraw the excessSingaporeans will need to know that the basic retirement sum will DEFINITELY INCREASE over the yearsFor example, at age 55, if you have $400k in your CPF, you will only be able to take out $84k (400-316) based on the above estimate of $316k for retirement sumIf you don’t have this amount, you will continue contributing to your CPF till age 65 or 70 where your payouts will beginFor most people who factor CPF into your retirement nest egg, your basic amount in that account will be higher over the yearsThis is due to inflation and increasing costs of living (very legit reasons) so the earlier in life you know this, the better (Period. If not You Not be LIT AF when you are 55)You should probably take a more pro-active step to managing your money (outside CPF) to counter this in later years (particularly if you are like me and have made your first huge HDB purchase) You can read the full article here: https://blog.seedly.sg/retirement-cpf-minimum-sum-maximum/1 comment0"
3,Charles Koh11 Jun 2019Think the concern should be on newborn or child not yet born in Singapore. The FRS will just keep increasing but a child from age 0 to probably 20 will not have any employment contribution. Their gap will be so big that it will be challenging for them to catch up or is it possible to catch up??
