question,"CPF Retirement Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) Asked by AnonymousAsked 4w agoComparing SRS contribution and CPF contribution, which is better?SRS is mostly for tax reduction, and the bank account only gives 0.5%. So if one wants to beat inflation, then they need to invest in stocks or bonds. CPF is for both tax reductions and higher interest. Cap at 7k for tax relief and other caps like full retirement sum. Which should I use first?3 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered 4w agoIf you have not opened an SRS account yet, can do so now with at least 1 dollar to lock in the retirement age for withdrawal (one of the retirement hacks)After which, if your CPF is below FRS, then a safe and almost risk-free approach is to TOP up your CPF to FRS and let the interests compound. Note TOP ups to special account are irreversible until retirement age. If to all 3 accounts, the ordinary portion can be utilised for your home mortgage.If you are in the higher income bracket and putting in srs can help you in your tax savings, and you have the spare cash flow to do so, then feel free to TOP it up. Just remember also to use the srs to invest in safe stocks/unit trusts/regular savings plan/SSB/robo-advisors etc to achieve at least a better yield than the savings account yield.  There will be some risks here but you can minimise it for sure.  In any case, if you can consider srs and if it helps you to significantly reduce your taxes, then most likely you can consider BOTH topping up CPF and SRS as an approach.0 comments0"
2,"Lu XinLevel 2. RookieUpdated 4w agoSRS gives you upfront tax savings. Any subsequent returns will depend on your risk-taking.On the other hand, CPF earns you an annual and ongoing stream of interest (almost) guaranteed by the government. It is now at least 2.5% p.a. based on the lowest tier returns. It is extremely rare in this low-interest rate worldIf your marginal (i.e. highest) income tax bracket is below 11%, there is not really much benefit to putting into SRS as CPF alone can replicate the upfront returns in 4 years and the guaranteed cumulative returns will exceed SRS thereafter.Nonetheless, if your marginal tax bracket is higher than 11%. There is a likelihood that your CPF contribution already exceeds the annual limit (with your bonus). Hence, SRS may become the only choice. If you still have the choice between SRS and CPF, do consider the time to your retirement age to assess which one makes better sense.
The above is purely based on mathematical comparison and assumes you have faith in both schemes.2 comments0"
3,"ADAwk D4w agoHaha. The last sentence I like. You need to have faith in both schemes. 
For example, if you are in the middle of the 11% tax range, I think the step should be always top up cpf cap first. Then consider srs.Lu Xin4w agoYup, generally yes. While ppl always mention the liquidity issue of CPF, technically most of those who are contemplating between these two seldom face such issues."

Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoMoney in SRS does not need to stay in the bank account for 0.5%,You can use it for stocks, unit trusts etc.For this extra flexibility and the flexibility that money in SRS can be withdrawn for uses (with penalty), while CPF you cannot withdraw no matter what, I will say SRS is a better tool with more flexibility in the long run.I prefer SRS.2 comments0"
5,"ADAwk D4w agoI consider the 5% penalty is quite high. Plus also need to pay the tax. Of course, if something happens to life then srs gives more flexibility.Cedric Jamie Soh4w agoYup. the 5% is indeed high. But in crisis, even if you are willing to fork out 50% for CPF board, you can't withdraw a single cent... :("
