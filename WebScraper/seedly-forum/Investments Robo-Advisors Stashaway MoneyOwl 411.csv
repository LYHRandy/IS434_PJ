question,Investments Robo-Advisors Stashaway MoneyOwl Asked by AnonymousAsked on 05 Aug 2019StashAway or MoneyOwl for someone new to investing?I'm pretty new to investing and have done some research. I've concluded that I would like to start with STI-ETFs and a Robo-Advisor. I'm thinking between StashAway and MoneyOwl. Seems like StashAway is doing pretty well but MoneyOwl seems reliable too. My priorities are returns & fees. What do you guys think? Which one is better for a beginner like me?1 answerAnswerBump1

God of WisdomUpdated on 06 Aug 2019They both have quite differing approaches to the market. If you can't decide between either, just try both for 3 to 5 years and see the difference.2 comments2"
2,"Question Poster06 Aug 2019Don't think i have enough capital to invest in both of them and the sti etf. Which would you recommend more?Hariz Arthur Maloy06 Aug 2019Wouldn't recommend a digital advisor because I provide a similar solution, but nonetheless, I'd skip investing in the STI in total. Go straight for a global portfolio."
