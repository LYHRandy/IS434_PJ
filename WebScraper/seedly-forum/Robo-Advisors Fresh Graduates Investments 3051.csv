question,"Robo-Advisors Fresh Graduates Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Nov 2018Is it opportunity or risky to buy US ETFs now?Hi! Just read the morning stock analysis on the Trump trade war.Given the news of the trade war and the falling prices of tech giants etc, would it still be a good idea to buy into the US ETF now on a monthly basis? I'm deciding if I should get started on using Robo-advisors to buy into US and hold the shares for a 5-10 year horizon. Would it be a risky / opportune time to do that now, given the falling market prices?2 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 14 Nov 2018If you're planning to use the Dollar Cost Averaging approach which is to buy US ETFs every month, then it doesn't matter when you enter the market since time in the market is better than timing the market. https://seedly.sg/questions/do-you-guys-think-that-dca-or-lsi-in-an-etf-is-a-better-strategy-for-the-market-climate-now0 comments0"
