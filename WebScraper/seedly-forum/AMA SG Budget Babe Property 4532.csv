1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018Location (needs to be near our parents and accessible to MRT cos I take public transport mostly)Number of rooms (to house everyone we're living with)Price Number of years left (if resale)​I consider future value but not too much because no one can predict the future. As long as I get a good deal now, then it should still be a good deal and profitable hopefully in the future :)​honestly, when it comes to housing, my husband is the expert so I defer to him for that! but we will discuss together :)0 comments1"
2,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Aug 2018This depends on your ultimate goal on what kind of house you want to stay in during your retirement years.​For me, its BTO for my first home since the prices for BTO tend to be slightly below market value (likely to make money from it after MOP). I was lucky to be able to secure a BTO at bedok with my first try.​The other consideration I had was affordability and whether both me and my gf would be able to comfortably pay off the monthly instalments.​Lastly, the potential value of the house if my goal is to sell it off after the MOP.​As for the roadmap i planned for myself, I would go for 2 BTOs (since all SGreans are entitled to 2 BTO chances), subsequently make a downpayment for 2 condos (individually owned, 1 name per property) with the proceeds. One condo will be rented out while one will be for my personal use. If all goes well financially, and no new cooling measures are implemented, I may consider getting a 3rd condo (considered as 2nd property) or commerical property for rental income.​Eventually, i hope to be able to sell off all 3 properties to own a landed freehold home eventually for my future generation.0 comments1"
