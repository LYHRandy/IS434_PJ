1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Are you referring to the great wealth multiplier and lured by the potential 10x returns? This comprises of guaranteed and non guaranteed components, and it's over a 55 year period of accumulation as per the brochure. Not really attractive and really uninspiring returns, as its about 4.35% give or take a year, assuming the participation fund performs well every year. Not really something I can swallow but it may suit those who are not savvy about investing or not confident about investing on their own.0 comments1"
