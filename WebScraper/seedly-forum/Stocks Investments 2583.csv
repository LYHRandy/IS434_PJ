1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 01 Mar 2019If you followed Oscars closely, its not merely just headline news about NFLX winning awards for Alfonso Cuaron's Roma.NFLX's overall win comes- because it validates their ability to continuously generate original content for its suscribers, in an age where rivals: Disney, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal and others are snatching back their own content to help feed potential audiences for their own competing streaming services.NFLX made a huge bet on a small pool of A-list directors and although missing out on the most contended- Best Picture, NFLX's acheivements considering its status as the new kid on the block, putting existing movie giants to shame.NFLX has proven its ability from previous successes to produce mainstream media. Now, this success paves the way for future artistic firm producers to aspire listing their shows on NFLX's platform for its unparalled audience reach. The movie and entertainment industry is just beginning to change, and I believe NFLX is positioned at the forefront. So while this news might not change Fundamentals per-se, its validates shareholders who see long term value and growth in NFLX.0 comments0"

3,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 28 Feb 2019I don't think this would affect the fundamentals of netflix, like the others mentioned, perception of netflix would be different. I think this shows that netflix is doing the right thing and is producing great quality content that can compete firmly with the rest of hollywood. Maybe investors thought that netflix couldn't match up to the rest. I think the surge in share prices could also signal in part to investors that netflix presents an edge over its other competitors.0 comments0"
