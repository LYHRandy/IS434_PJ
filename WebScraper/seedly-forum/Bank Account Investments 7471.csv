WonderkidAnswered on 25 Feb 2019A summary of OCBC results by Moltey Fools as linked - https://www.fool.sg/2019/02/22/oversea-chinese-banking-corp-limiteds-full-year-2018-earnings-weak-fourth-quarter-but-higher-final-dividend/But in my opinion, the increased in dividend will have caused investor to be more ""relaxed"". It is in the mind of SG investors that dividend is better.Nevertheless, if you looked ahead and depending on what price one enters on OCBC, the impact seems short term. A long term investor will just ride out these volatility.0 comments1"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Apparently the fall in earnings is due to lowered contribution from Great Eastern's contribution. Their net profit contribution wnet down 70 per cent YOY because of unrealised mark-to-market losses in its investment portfolio. The prior year also included substantially higher realised gains from the divestment of investment securities.DBS still maintaing a ""buy"" call on OCBC though.
