1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Apr 2019Depends what kind of returns you want. Mutual funds can offer you either market beating returns or returns that have a better return-risk ratio than the market. Otherwise, don't invest in them.ETFs will give you market returns minus tax, transactional fees or reinvestment fees.0 comments0"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019Etfs will be a better choice, fees wise. Mutual funds suck out a lot of profits via fees over the long run. Not to mention that there's bound to be periods with negative returns yet fees still need to be paid.Etfs are also more liquid, as they are listed on stock exchanges and you can transact during market hours. Mutual funds need to transact via the fund house and sometimes this may take days.Consider building an all weather Etf portfolio if you are interested in the Etf route. This is to prevent significant drops in value during market downturns. Hope this helps0 comments0"
