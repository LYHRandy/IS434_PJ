question,"ETF Investments AMA The Fifth Person Asked by AnonymousAsked on 17 Feb 2019Is it possible to gain global and asset diversification exposure in my portfolio just by buying ETFs only?Currently doing RSP with Nikko AM STI ETF and want to include (1) ETF with global exposure and (2) ETF with asset diversification in their porfolio(Stocks, Bonds, REITs in a single ETF, not asset specific ETF). I know that there are Vanguard and FSMone that addresses (1), but is unsure if there are any ETFs that have asset diversifications in it. Side question, should I replace Nikko with SPDR STI (Reason: Lower expense ratio) and could i buy other local ETFs without brokerage ( DBS vickers)?3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Hi, You can gain global exposure by investing in ETF only. When it comes to ETF investing I only refer to Index ETF. When choosing an Index ETF, I usually go to the lowest cost ETF because over a long period of time the lowest cost player tend to outperform. If I am at your situation, I will probably keep the Nikko STI ETF but when I buy ETF in the future, I will focus on the SPDR STI ETF.To my understanding, you need a local brokerage to purchase ETF as for whether to purchase without broker, I am not sure about it.0 comments0"
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You should go for SPDR when possible its slightly better than Nikko. Number 1 you can go for IWDA or VWRD etf for global exposure on stocks. Number 2 im not too sure. There are not much good ETFs in Singapore, even the STI ETF is not that good because they only have 30 companies and they have very high weightage on the banking industries like DBS, OCBC and UOB. Its not really diversified. You need a broker to buy stocks or ETFs. US have more varieties in term of ETFs so dont limit youself to local etfs only because they are not good. You can use Interactive broker or Standard chartered to buy overseas ETFs. I would recommend buying from london stock exchange the ireland-domiciled etf. Because if you were to buy US etfs, it will have 30% withholding tax on your dividends. But if you buy the ireland-domiciled ones, it will be reduced to 15%.3 comments0"

You can do DCA on any stocks or ETFs but DCA usually small amount so you have to take into consideration of the fees because a lot minimum $10. So if manually DCA $500 a month meaning you go into the brokerage website and buy yourself monthly, your fees are 2% because minimum $10 which is pretty high. You can also consider DCA with robo advisors although you can only choose the aggressiveness not the specific ETF. There is also R...

3. Depends on how you see it. Im not too sure about the tax but if you are confident with US market even if they charge you 30% withholding, it will still be good to invest in US. Fees and taxes are important to take into consideration but ultimately its your choice to see if you think HK will do well. If HK dont do well, no tax or not doesnt really matter."
4,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Yes, you can. However, returns from ETFs will be limited as compared to directly purchasing the equity directly. As you have stated, management fees will accumuate more so when your entire portfolio is ETFs.You should look at the tracking error of both SPDR STI and Nikko AM and management fee first. If SPDR STI is lower for both, you can consider switching. Iit takes some time to switch as ETFs relies on DCA and you should not lump sum transfer your ETF.Yes you can buy other local SG ETFs from DBS Vickers. Do note that there's also charges for storing your units.2 comments0"
5,"Question Poster17 Feb 2019I forgot to consider about the management & transaction fees will accumulate, thanks for the reminder. So I guess it would be better to diversify the portfolio through direct purchase of stocks. 
And if i would like to purchase foreign ETFs, i should purchase via Vanguard etc, yes?Lok Yang Teng17 Feb 2019That would be ideal if you have the sufficient funds to do so. Meanwhile you can stick with ETFs for the time being."
