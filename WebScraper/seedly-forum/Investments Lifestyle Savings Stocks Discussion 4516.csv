1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Aug 2019Unfortunately, the REIT market has rallied quite a bit since the beginning of the year, especially the good ones.Each person may have a preference for a specific sector. Not sure what is yours. You may want to find a sector then look at the list of REITs that focus on this. Look at each REIT's model and past performance. Are dividends stable or increasing? Or is it taking a beating due to management decisions? Look at oue as a case in point. Once you find a REIT then look at each REIT's nav and current price. Find a point where the current price is below the nav ideally. If not possible find the point where the spread between nav and price is at lowest and enter at this point.Hope this helps!0 comments1"
