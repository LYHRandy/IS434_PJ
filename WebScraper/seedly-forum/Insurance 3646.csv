question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 Apr 2019Should I surrender AXA pulsar?Hi guys. I have two AXA pulsar 30-year policies which i started in 2014 and 2016. I am considering to surrender them because of the high fees. But I will lose first 18 months premium that I contributed which is alot. Currently, the return of the funds is flat, net of fees. Should I surrender them or continue paying the high charges? Hope to receive some advice4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Li Yu, Financial Services Consultant at Manulife Financial AdvisorsLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 13 Jun 2019I was an AXA agent before (now with another insurance company). Truth be told, when I was in AXA I never really recommended pulsar to any of my clients/friends becos the fees are really quite high. Pulsar is attractive becos it gives very high start-up bonus. Other ILPs in the market do not have such high start-up bonuses, but also charge much lower fees. So if you are looking at long-term capital growth, Pulsar should not be the plan to go to. Pulsar is only competitive if flexibility (in terms of withdrawal) is of great importance to you. An alternative to surrendering the plan might be to use your account value to sustain itself. By that, I mean to withdraw money from your pulsar account (cos partial withdrawal is free of charge) and put back as premium, so you don't have to take out additional money from your pocket. For that to work, you have to have sufficient fund in your account. The policy started in 2014 might be able to do so. For the 2016 plan, you still need to continue paying new premium for at least 2-3 years.Meanwhile, try to do a portfolio review with your AXA consultant or any other trusted consultant. If the return of your funds are only beating the fees, then they are not really performing well. You should consider switching to other funds.3 comments2"

I'm not too sure if you can do your own fund switch though... Maybe you want to call their customer hotline (it's 6880 4888) to check? If you know other consultants from AXA or an IFA that can represent AXA products, you can change your servicing agent this other person too so he/she can help you with your investment from then onwards.Eric Chia13 Jun 2019Hi Li Yu, I've seen a client's AXA Pulsar recently and the policy value is really high due to the start up bonus. Not sure what you meant by high fees, it's close to 100% allocation rate from the start right? Pulsar isn't the kind which the allocation rates start from 20 or 30% in the first few years ya?"

4,"Alan HoLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 30 Aug 2019I brought two plans for my daughter too. I am very upset with this plan cos the charges are really high. Worst off, I recently found out that the dividends can be defaulted or delayed. Checked with them through my agent, they claimed it was due to system errors.
Though we received the dividends after complaining, the situation remain resolved. Was very tired, need to closely monitor the account.Suggest close monitoring your account to avoid the issue or else this policy will continue depicting.1 comment0"

MasterAnswered on 29 Apr 2019Okay let's look at the facts.1) Fees erode your returns. 2) Surrendering your policy is going to erode them even more.Instead of doing that, you can get your asset allocation reviewed and see if you're going to make much higher returns with the resources available to you. That's why AXA keeps touting it's Accredited Investor Funds, for example.On my end, ILPs have naturally higher costs than ETFs. Even MoneyOwl has considerably higher fees than ETFs (not as much as an ILP obviously, but). With Pulsar you have the potential to outperform the market by a vast margin. So don't surrender it just because of that reason - look at your current performance now. It's very likely with funds available on AXA that you're outperforming most people here net of fees. Straight off - I am not an AXA agent. I will not have the ability to 'take over' your portfolio or manage it. But I can tell you whether it's doing well and whether it has the potential to do well, so you can actually drop me a message  if you'd like.  https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.54  https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/ilps-as-a-retirement-solution0 comments0"
