question,"Bank Account Savings Asked by AnonymousAsked on 05 Apr 2019Which other bank accounts should I use after maxing out my Multiplier account?I'm risk-averse and do not have much time to learn about investing, so I've only put money into SSBs so far. My monthly CC spend hovers around $400-$600ish, no loans. I'm hitting the max 50k for my DBS Multiplier account soon, so I was wondering what are some other banks I can consider? Close it and move to UOB? Put more into SSBs (but their recent interest rates not that great..)? Would appreciate any advice, thank you!1 answerAnswerBump0"

But minimum 15k to earn the step up bonus and 70k to earn the SIBOR interest. Currently you can earn 2.48% after 12 months of step up bonus and minimum 70k.0 comments0"
