WizardAnswered on 12 Mar 2019You are assuming the price can move that fast in less than 3 days.And don't forget there are still commission charges for buy/sell 2 ways. If you do 100 shares, the profit might not cover the commissions.Worst case to happen: Stock trading is halted by sgx. You have to cover the losses.0 comments1"
