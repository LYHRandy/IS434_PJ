I like what some of the answers here advises, try a progressive take over of bill paying first, starting with your phone bill, followed by other stuff around the house. I think it's also great to have a sit down and talk with them, explain how you feel that it's time that you start helping around with the finances for the household. I'm sure they'll understand(and feel proud too at that)!0 comments3"

Start small and I’m sure u can settle the rest. If lodging payment, can give monthly sum of money to your parent for eg. $100-$2000 comments3"
3,"Caelyn LimLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 28 Nov 2018I believe the first step into adulthood is paying for own phone bill. It helps you get more involved into your own personal finance status. It's very nice of your parents to want to continue paying and I understand it takes time for some to grasp the idea of their child has grown up. If they still insist, I suggest returning the bill amount along with monthly allowance for them through auto transfer to their bank accounts. Occasionally treat them to meals and take charge of paying for groceries whenever you can. Thats what I am doing now (: 0 comments2"

It's time to give back instead of taking from them!First thing you can do is start paying your own bills. It's not hard, as most bills, if not all, can be paid online now. you can also auto-transfer money from your bank account to your parents monthly. it's easy to figure out how to, and just takes a few minutes of your time to set it up.0 comments2"
5,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 27 Nov 2018Since you just started working, you can start paying your bills first, e.g., phone bills.  Work out your monthly expenses and plan on how much you can save and give your parents as allowance in return for the lodging. You can increase your allowance to your parents as your salary increased or give more during bonus / AWS time. 0 comments1"
6,"Xinyi Lum, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 Nov 2018This question resonates so much with me, and I am blessed to have my parents pay certain daily living costs for me. Meals are a given and I live in the house for free - think we tend to overlook that as kids. In return, (since my parents refuse to stop paying for me), I sometimes get groceries without ""claiming"" from them or buy them meals without expecting them to return me the money. If something runs out around the house, offer to top it up if it's within your means,It's small acts but I hope it also makes them feel like there's a two-way giving in this.0 comments1"

8,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Nov 2018It is great that you want to take responsibility for your own finances. That would help you become a more responsible person.Why not progressively start paying for your own bills? Perhaps you can take over the phone bills first this month. Then subsequently lodging next month. Then other bills the following month, so on and so forth.With such a gradual transition, I am sure your parents will be more comfortable that their child has grown up and has matured.Cheers. Wishing you all the best!0 comments0"
