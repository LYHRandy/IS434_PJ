God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoMy understanding is that 134,089,000 units were issued as part of a placement exercise late in 2018. Also, the REIT managers may have taken some of their fees in units. When calculating EPS, the REIT would not include these units since their impact on the calculation is not for the full year EPS, as they were only issued late in the year.3 comments4"
