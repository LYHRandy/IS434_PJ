2,"Arron TanLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Tough one! That depends. Is your current diploma related to what you want to do in future? If so, I highly suggest you start working. Starting work as soon as possible also just means that you will be earning money as soon as possible. Think about it, if you pursued a degree, there is literally a 100% chance that your peers will be fighting for the same jobs you will be applying for upon graduating. Why compete when you can get a head start?Therein lies the dilemma. What if I do not have the knowledge to do a good job? Chances are, even if you furthered your studies, it would not mean that you have the skill sets to excel in your future job anyway. University courses do not necessarily teach you the practical skills needed to succeed in the industry you are heading towards, and I can almost guarantee that you will probably need to undergo some form of primary training in your future employment anyway. My take on this is that, if you can start earning money as soon as possible; why not start as soon as you can. Nevertheless, this is just my two cents worth, and I do hope you think it through. It definitely is a tough choice, but whichever choice you choose to make, please make sure it is one you will not regret. I hope I helped!0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 23 Sep 2018I suggest: ​Work for a few years, get some good understanding of the actual work, pros and cons, what do you like to do or not like to do etc. ​With that experience in mind, you will be able to decide better what suits you in the degree choices, and directions that you wish to go. ​This is like , if you never try the food , how do you know it is nice or not nice  by just looking at the menu or picture. Even if is recommended by food blogger, it is still your own personal preferences that matters to you. ​If you had tried the food, you then can decide to order more, and if to continue to come to this place to eat. This way you will save much more time, effort and a great deal of pain.​Apply Lean Principle (or read ""The lead startup"") and you will be able help decides life's matter better :) 0 comments0"

9,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Aug 2018My personal 2 cents to you! I would decide to study first. It's a better flow...​Reason is like that: when you go to NS, your brain kinda rots alot in that 2 years. Because you hardly take exams and study.​Thereafter, I think it makes alot of sense to study again as you should be able to ramp up in that first few months. Then go out to work after that 4 years. ​Because in that 4 years, you'll be 100% focused on studying and doing projects, internships etc. If you were to have worked outside and started earning money, the disruption to your work will be a tough one. Because suddenly you lose an income source and instead have to commit to full time studies. So in the end, many people choose not to go back to study.​Again, all these above is when I reference the idea that you actually can survive without earning income for the next 4 years when you are studying :) or can do some part time gigs on the side while studying.0 comments0"
