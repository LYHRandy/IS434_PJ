1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Business ProfileSource: Next Insight  Sino Grandness is an integrated manufacturer and distributor of own-branded juices as well as canned fruits and vegetables in China. They produce loquat fruit juice in China as well as export canned asparagus, long beans and mushrooms. The Groupâ€™s products are distributed globally across Europe, North America and in Asia, in renowned supermarkets, discount stores and convenience stores including as Lidl, Rewe, Carrefour, Walmart, Harpenden, Coles, Jusco and Metro.The production plants in China are strategically located in four provinces. Interestingly, the production bases straddle different climatic regions so that production activities can be carried throughout the year.Source: The Straits Times Forecasts and EstimatesI forecasted that Sino Grandness will enjoy high growth in earnings over the next few years. This is supported by higher than industry average ROC historically but lowered to reflect more intense competition over the years. I grant that Sino Grandees will continue to have to some leeway in growing its revenue over the next few years as it had strong revenue growth previously. However as the company matures and the industry becomes more saturated, Sino Grandness will probably find it much tougher to retain customers and its competitive advantage. Leading to pricing pressures and high expenses. During the stable growth period, I project that Sino Grandness will reflect the growth of 1% revenue per year. I believe that this industry will continue to grow and expand, as the global population increases and the need for such staples increase. Sino Grandness just has to ensure that it grows with the industry. However, during the stable growth period, I predict that newer entrants into the market will erode ROC such that the ROC would equal the COC. I don't believe that Sino Grandness has a  firm competitive advantage that helps to stave off competition, and thus their advantage over competitors might decrease over time. Hence, growth would not add value to the company's investors through time. The COC is on the lower end due to low cost of debt and high leverage. Cost of Equity is higher however due to the high levered Beta and risk premium from operating in China. ValuationBased on this simple DCF, it seems that the shares of the firm could be undervalued. This stock was also singled out by Motley Fool as one of the top few stocks to buy in June based on the Magic Formula.1 comment4"
