1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Well better late than never.... it really depends how much you and your wife have in your SA / MA. If  both of you already hit the Full Retirement Sum, then there is nothing you need to do but to let it compound.   you target might need to be more realistic then: e.g. S$1M by 70 or $600/800K by 65 etc. Still good money. If you have not max the SA/MA accounts, you might want to seriously consider doing it to increase your retirement wealth.   What are the risk?Foreseeable Risk: a. Policy changesb. PAP collapsed and a new govt comes in and spend away our CPF, or cave in to popular cries for ""return our CPF"".c. Missing out a nice condo / apartment purchased. early death. For me, such risk are managable. I dont think politically the risks are high. Never believed in Property investment anyway. 1 comment5"
