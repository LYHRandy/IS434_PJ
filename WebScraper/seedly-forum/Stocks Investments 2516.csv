1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019You can set your take profit or cut loss triggers and go to sleep like what Gabriel has mentioned. Personally I'm involved in the US market as well with my options portfolio. As I sell options I don't really need to stay awake till closing bell and am usually done by 1am or so on Fridays when contracts expire. Otherwise, on weekdays I don't even need to monitor much. You can consider managing options as an alternative to stocks as the returns are much better and you don't need constant monitoring. Hope this helps0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Are you trading US or are you more of a long term investor in US stocks?If you are trading US short term, and losing sleep, maybe you can consider trading on a longer time frame, daily or weekly timeframes vs hourly or 4 hourly charts.If you trade on daily/weekly timeframe or long term investor, you just need to check prices in SG time, set your orders, stop loss before the US market opens then go sleep.0 comments0"
