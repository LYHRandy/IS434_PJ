WizardAnswered on 30 May 2018This is a pretty broad topic, will prefer if you could give us more context to understanding your lifestyle needs, and dependancies, life stages etc :) ​But as a whole, there is a saying, diversity should not be there just for the sake of it. You have to undertstand why you need to diversify. Do you want to do it across industries, sectors, asset classes? :) Many ways to diversify.​The other option is to buy into funds which are already theoretically diversified or ETFs (exchange traded funds) which follows indexes.0 comments0"
