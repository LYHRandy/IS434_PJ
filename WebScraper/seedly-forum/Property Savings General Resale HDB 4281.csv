1,"Jennifer GohLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 13 Jun 2019Costs of resale HDB resale flats can vary _significantly _based on factors such as location, amenities and condition. These are just an estimate of the costs for resale flats in 2019:Three-room: S$350,000 to S$380,000Four-room: S$420,000 to S$550,000Five-room: S$520,000 to S$700,000You will probably use both cash and CPF savings for your flat purchase. Your financial planning should therefore cover:How much cash is requiredAmounts that can be paid using CPF savingsCash are used for the following payments:Deposit to seller (a maximum of $5,000, paid in 2 stages: the option fee, and the deposit)Part of the initial payment (if you take a bank loan, or have insufficient CPF savings)Amount not covered by CPF savings and eligible housing loan amountCash proceeds from disposing the last flat if you are taking a second HDB loanCPF can be used for:Initial payment in whole or in part (depending on whether an HDB or bank housing loan is used)Partial or full payment for the flat purchaseMonthly mortgageÂ instalmentsHope this helps a little! :) Sources:https://www.homeanddecor.com.sg/articles/91183-property-step-step-guide-buying-resale-flat https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/finplan https://learn.moneysmart.sg/property/how-much-will-your-first-home-cost/ https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/costs-of-bto-flat-resale-flat-ec-and-condo-in-singapore0 comments4"

I presume that you are a first timer since you are getting a flat next year. In any case, please check your eligibility for the various housing grants on offer, it will help you cover a significant amount of the housing costs if planned right.
You might also want to consider an upcoming EC in punggol for your new home if your finances and eligibility allows.
