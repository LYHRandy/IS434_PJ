question,"Fresh Graduates Savings Bank Account Credit Card General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Oct 2018What's the advantage of getting a credit card? Fresh grad who is new to personal finance here?Hi guys. I'm a fresh grad, drawing less than $2000 take-home salary each month and spend $900-$1000 a month (including giving my family allowance). Frankly I've never considered getting a credit card, but am now thinking of getting a DBS/POSB one to hit the DBS Multiplier criteria. 1) Saw that the annual fee is ~$192/year which is quite a big sum for me. Why do everyone get credit cards then? 2) Given my low salary, are there any DBS / POSB cards you know that may suit me?7 answersAnswerBump1"

Just worried that the DBS staff would give me a flat no if I call in.Kang Soon Ang16 Oct 2018you can try to call in right now, there is an option for credit card fee waiver without even speaking to customer service. however, am unsure on the conditions where waiver is rejected."
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Oct 2018Honestly, you may not qualify for a credit card at the moment based on your current salary range. Minimum to qualify is S$30,000 annual income, or S$2.5k a month gross, or S$2k take home, which is above the amount you mentioned. No harm trying to apply for one though. For annual fees, these can typically be waived, and I do that for all my cards. Unless you took up DBS Altitude card, which gives you 10k miles if you pay the annual membership fee. I do the same for my Citibank Premiermiles. As per the type of card that may be suitable for you, it'll depend on what you are using the card to accumulate for - miles or cashback. DBS Altitude for miles, and perhaps POSB Everyday card if you prefer cashback. You can put your telco and utility bills on this card, and it offers some good cashback at Watsons and Sheng Siong. 0 comments0"

5,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 16 Oct 2018Credit cards are useful for getting cashback, rebates, deals, rewards etc., depending on which credit card you're using. However, it is truly useful only if you can control your spending and pay your bills on time. Otherwise, you might end up with a credit card debt which has high interest and late payment fees. Most credit cards require a minimum annual income of $30,000. So maybe you can consider the CIMB AWSM Credit Card and change to another card as you progress in your career in the future.It has no annual fees and gives you 1% cashback on Dining & Entertainment, Telecommunications (Starhub/M1/Singtel/Circles.Life) and Online Shopping. If you sign up before 31 December, you can get a free Wave House Sentosa 1 hour FlowRider (worth S$40) and $30 credit if you spend at least $100 within 2 months from the date of your card activation. Check out the CIMB Awesome (AWSM) Credit Card here - https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/en/personal/products/cards/credit-cards/cimb-awsm-card.htmlIn any case, I believe that it's possible to ask for waiver of the annual fees0 comments0"
6,"Gerard Ong, Tax consultant  at Ernst & Young Level 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Apart from cashback and/ or miles, another benefit is that you only have to pay for your purchases about 1+ month after the actual expenditure. This means that the money that would have been spent gets to sit in your bank account for that one extra month. And earn interest! For free!Credit cards usually have their first 1-2 years of annual fees automatically waived. After which, you can call in for case-by-case waiver. As long as you can pay your credit card bills on time, there are no costs to using one, but plenty of benefits. 4 comments0"
7,"See all 4 comments Gerard Ong16 Oct 2018Hi QP, from my experience for case-by-case waivers, you can just call in to the credit cards hotline to simply request for a fee waiver. For DBS, they usually grant it outright without any questions asked. OCBC cards tend to be stricter.Gerard Ong16 Oct 2018The income requirement is a strict rule, yes. If you are unable to meet the $30k minimum, you can consider applying for student credit cards / debit cards instead. See https://blog.seedly.sg/best-credit-cards-for-students/ for more details. Unfortunately, DBS student credit card has a strict requirement that the applicant must be an undergraduate student at the point of application, so that option is ruled out for you."
8,"Daniel LingLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 16 Oct 2018Spending cash has zero benefits unless the sales has additional tax on non cash payments.
E.g.: sim lim Square.However most cash else modes have benefits including credit cards.
POSB everyday has simple cash back rebates which you can off set credit card bills.
The amount may be tiny but it is still a flat discount.Food for thought if you now need to spend more.This card is just an example, you have to do your own research.Tldr: cash has zero benefits, usually.
Non cash usually have benefits.
Just do not get a benefit that does not suit you, e.g.: miles but you do not fly.0 comments0"
