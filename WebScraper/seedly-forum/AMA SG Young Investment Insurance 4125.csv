question,"AMA SG Young Investment Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Sep 2018What type of life insurance with what conditions will be most suitable, and how much should I be insured for?Generally from advice I've seen, insurance premiums are the lowest when bought at a younger age due to less medical problems etc. I do not have any dependents and future expected salary will be a big question mark due to still being in NS. These conditions will change quite drastically in the future.1 answerAnswerBump0"

The premiums are generally not expensive and can be paid by medisave. Do take note to check if you have enough medisave in your CPF to last till you start working. When you join the workforce, you can then consider term insurance which will insure for death, critical illness and total permanent disability. Term insurance typically can cover up to $1M which cost around $1200/year if you buy in your 20s. A good website to compare and find out about insurance is DIY insurance: https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/home/â€‹I would personally avoid investment link policy as it is too complicated. My strategy for insurance is simply to buy term insurance and invest the rest of my money myself. Generally, I will not to spend more than 10% of my  income for insurance. 0 comments0"
