question,"Property AMA SG Budget Babe Asked by AnonymousAsked on 11 Aug 2018How do you plan to get a home and how much are you planning to set aside for that?I think saving 100k before the age of 30 is impressive given that you don't come from a privileged background! I understand that you have yet to buy your own home, was that a deliberate financial decision?1 answerAnswerBump0"

You can do it too with determination and perserverence (and a few lifestyle changes) I believe! :)â€‹Yes, we initially planned to buy our own home this year but then we found out I was pregnant, haha! As we have limited funds, it would be too much of a stretch to pay for both a newborn AND a house AND renovations at the same time, so we're putting our house plans on hold until baby is a little older!0 comments0"
