God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoHi Anon, my view is that it would be better to have part of your rainy-day funds in more liquid assets like cash, as it takes up to one month to liquidate an SSB. In an emergency, you would want to have immediate liquidity.Although I do not know what REITS you have bought, but having $800 across 5 REITs would have incurred quite a significant brokerage cost for you, even if you are just dipping your fingers. You will need to account for the cost of investment when you invest as it can significantly eat into your returns, especially when your capital outlay is low. Usually, for shares, I would not advise purchasing them unless you have significant capital to deploy (we're talking mid-4 figures and above)If you have $1.2K/month to invest, I would recommend dividing your cashflow into various buckets to go into the various asset classes. You can allocate some to UTs, some to ETFs such as Stashaway, some to a warchest to prepare to buy shares when opportunities present themselves, and some to an annuity to hedge your investment risk. The allocation will depend on various factors such as your preferences and risk appetite.You may want to consider talking to an independent advisor who will be able to provide you with greater insight and help you craft a strategy to implement that will suit you. I am only able to advise you based on the information you have currently provided; any further advice would require a deeper understanding of your situation. Feel free to reach out to me if you require.0 comments8"

WonderkidAnswered 3w agoI think your SSB is great as a rainy day fund, so you can keep your cash on hand lower than most people's emergency funds.Still, you need a bit of cash in banks, keep them in high-interest saving accounts such as DBS Multiplier, UOB One account or OCBC 360 Account :D0 comments2"

I personally do not insist on my friends and family on having an extremely fluid emergency fund if they are comfortable with that. However, do you know that it takes minimally one month for you to withdraw from SSB?
Are you confident that you can survive 1/2 month(s) (in emergency scenarios like loss of job upon an accident) before you get your rainy-day funds from SSB?With regards to your REITs investment, putting all of your investments into REITs may not be the most efficient form of investment. We first have to find out why are you investing in REITs, your purpose and what you want to achieve in your investment journey3 comments1"

This is a rule of thumb and a very rough estimate as we do not have enough information to make a detailed analysis. If you are uncomfortable sharing online, you can reach me via a DMNNinja1w agoYou can contact me ah, not financial advisor but can recommend you some books. First of all, just look at your monthly expenses and multiply the average by six and that should prepare you for six months"
