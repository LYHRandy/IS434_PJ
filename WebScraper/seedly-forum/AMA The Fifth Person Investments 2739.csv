When deciding whether you want to invest a small sum monthly or large sum at one go, you will need to know the key differences between the two methods. Investing a small sum of monthly each month is essentially engaging in dollar cost averaging , where you reduce the effect that market timing may have on your investment. you are reducing the potential effect that market timing may have on your investment. Doing so will help you to reduce the effect of entering the market at the wrong time. The amount you pay is now an average price. While investing a large sum of money at one go you will need to ensure that you enter the market at the correct time. Entering the market at the wrong time may result in you investing your money when the market prices are high. However, it also means that you will also be able to enter when the market price is at the lowest.If you are more experienced, investing a large sum at one go may be better while for beginners, investing a monthly sum maybe better.0 comments0"

Cost per unit will average out over time. For the more seasoned invesor/technical anaylst, large sum at one go will be better.0 comments0"
