Typically custodian will offer lower cost. Also if u want to trade overseas stocks, u will have to use them anyway. The con is that technically u are not a shareholder, u cannot attend agm, vote etc. But if u are a buy and forget type, CDP will be better. Especially if u want to hold it for long term dividends etc. You will directly receive notification of any corporate actions taken by the company. You dont have to remember your password to your trading account. Easier to account for all your assests. And in future if u intend to leave them as part of your legacy.0 comments0"
