1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 11 May 2019The best investment strategy is to have a portfolio tailored for your desired outcome and diversified among the 6 major asset classes. A strategy that is tailored just for you. And as Yi xiong has mentioned, investment in your own learning and growth can reap great rewards. Highly recommend you to check out some courses or books as an investment. üëçüèª0 comments2"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 May 2019There is no one best investment strategy for all. Everyone is different, be it in their risk profiles or personality when it comes to money and investments. I may like the use of options and am comfortable with this. But to others they may shy away as they are not comfortable with the use of margin or potentially unlimited liability.Perhaps you can look into what Yixiong has mentioned - invest in yourself. Invest in your family and those who are important to you. They will be your bedrock. Build on it, then build on yourself with more knowledge in finance / investment and experience. Explore and find an investment instrument you are comfortable with and stick with it. Master it. That will be the best investment strategy for you.0 comments0"

4,"Adrian Goh Jun Wei, Product at NodeflairLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 May 2019Unfortunately, there is no one size fits all strategy when it comes to investment. It is highly dependent of the situation and needs of an individuals.A fresh grad with debt will require a different strategies from a retiree or a mum in her 30's.Even for 2 individuals with background and income that are exactly identical, their difference in investment goals and risk appetite will affect their investment strategies.0 comments0"
