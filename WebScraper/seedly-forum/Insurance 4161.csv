question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Jul 2018Which insurer covers cruise insurance?My family is planning on a cruise trip (3 days, with 1 day stop over in KL), but I can't seem to find more articles relating to cruise insurance. Does anyone from the community has experience on this or where/which insurer covers cruise insurance? (p.s. the cruise package we signed up for, did not include insurance.)1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 20 Jul 2018Travel insurance would be your best bet after all you are still travelling out of Singapore. ​Another alternative would be getting your own Personal Accident insurance (that covers TCM, food poisoning, dengue etc.) if you feel travel insurance covers more than what you need like flight delay etc.​You can find the best travel insurance through this comparison here.​0 comments1"
