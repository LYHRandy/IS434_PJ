1,"Harvey TanLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 04 Sep 2019For pure-play on the China market, you can consider 2801.HK listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The TER is reasonable considering you are investing in the China market. The fund size is pretty big so fund closure risk is pretty low.

2,"See all 3 comments Harvey Tan04 Sep 2019Before i settled on 2801, I actually did come across 3169 as well. However as 3169 is relatively new and hence the fund size is pretty small. The fund closure risk is much higher especially if the fund did not managed to gather enough assets over time. Fund issuers are known for closing down ETFs when they did not managed to gather enough assets to justify the cost of managing it. Both 2801 and 3169 pays out dividend so you have reinvested it back yourself. In terms of expense ratio, 2801is lower. In terms of the preferred ETF, I believe it boils down to preference. Both follow different benchmarks and therefore have slightly difference top holdings. For me, the main factor why I go with 2801 is because it is more ""established"". However, if 3169 has the same track record as  2801, I would have go with 3169 because the benchmark for 3169 actually contain a wider securities universe if i am not wrong.Harvey Tan04 Sep 2019Thanks for the question. This question gave me an idea for a new article."
