Grand MasterAnswered on 30 May 2019If income is the only consideration then, I say as high as possible. Don’t put a ceiling for yourself.That being said, it is important to balance out the work and relationships too. No point being a multi millionaire and having nothing or no one to spend on.We can’t bring our wealth to the grave with us after all.0 comments4"
2,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 30 May 2019As high as you can get.That said, don't just chase the amount, but look at the learning opportunities and expansion that it provides.Additionally, don't be blinded by greed. When someone offers you a high compensation, think about why that would be the case. But that said, at the end of the day, cash is a much more flexible resource than time. To put it into context, we can always check how much we have left in the bank, but we can't know for sure how much time we have left. Time is our most valuable resource - choose what you spend your time on wisely.0 comments3"

If you're talking about salary expectations, it really is about your field of study and what employers are willing to pay for the position you're applying for. But you should still pursue side hustles and increase your income.0 comments2"
