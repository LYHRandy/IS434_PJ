question,"Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Nov 2018What should you do if your expenses are higher than your income every month?Actually I'm in between jobs now, and I'm doing some ad hoc jobs. I've already cancelled most of my luxuries (eg. gym membership, not to take Grab so much etc). I still have savings, but I'm trying to make sure I don't eat too much into them while I'm still looking for the job.3 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Nov 2018Cut down on your expenses if you can't increase your income. See what you do not need. Instead of taking grab, why not take public transport/cycle/walk? Cut down on drinks, eat more cheaply, etc. It all adds up!0 comments0"
2,Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Nov 2018Of course the easiest way is to cut down on your expenditure. The other being increasing your income. Write down in a list of what you spend for the month. Decide on what's really important and see how you can cut it down from there. Rough guide you can follow is the 70-20-10 rule.0 comments0

It is good that you have savings and i assume no debts yet and also conscious not to fall into any debt trap. Income can be increased and expenses can also be reduced. It is all up to you own choices and willpower to determine eventually how you gonna make your income higher then your expenses every month. Try to identify your key expenditures and further reduce and good luck to getting a stable job with good income. 0 comments0
