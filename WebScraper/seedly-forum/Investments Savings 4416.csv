If you are low risk or your investment horizon is pretty short, then you can't ask for high returns.If you're high risk, and have a long investment horizon, expecting double-digit returns is possible. And your portfolio has to match the risk you're expected to take to achieve double-digit returns.A minimum no matter, if you're high or low risk, is to just beat inflation.
