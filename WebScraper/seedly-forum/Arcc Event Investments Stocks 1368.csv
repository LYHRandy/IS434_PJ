1,"Chin Guo QiangLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 May 2019I would say investments to be made 24 by 7 while on the go, with a smartphone and a mobile app (if the company does make one)No longer you need to consult real people agents for investment topics, over a weekend session with coffee or tea.It allows technically inclined people, especially millennials to use this as an mobile idea for real-time or quick investments.As the old saying goes, good opportunities do not wait for long when they come knocking on the door. Mobile applications allow this very same idea to be realized !0 comments1"
