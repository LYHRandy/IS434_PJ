1,"Dexter TiahLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jun 2019Hi, there is actually an answer to your specific question and similar questions like these. Basically, you can key in the merchant ""Grabpay"" in the search field in www.whatcard.sg. In that site, you can see the rewards offered by the various credit cards, to optimize your cashback/rewards! I did this for your question, and the result is: Amex Ascend has the best miles reward (3.2mpd), and HSBC Advance has the best cashback (2.5%, subject to you hitting S$2k spending that month) for Grabpay.0 comments1"
