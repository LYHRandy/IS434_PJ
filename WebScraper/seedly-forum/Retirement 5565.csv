question,"Retirement Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Dec 2018Where would be the better place to live after retirement?I just bought a new flat and was happily selecting the cleaning appliances when it struck me that I wouldnâ€™t be physically or even monetarily able to maintain this flat after retirement. After that, I began to think about the feasibility of maintaining the flat vs staying in an elderly home where cleaning and meals could be settled. For second option, then I need to really consider when to sell the flat to get a good price and money for elderly home.1 answerAnswerBump0"

You get to spend time with them, watch your grandkids grow up, help them save costs by looking after themIf this isn't an option, and you are tied up financially, then going to an elderly care would make the most sense- basiacally there are trained professionals there, you can also make friends etc. The main downside is that you have to adhere to their schedules and rules and timetable.If you can afford it on the other hand, you can always stay in the flat and hire a personal helper for yourself. Expensive, but more personalised at least.0 comments2"
