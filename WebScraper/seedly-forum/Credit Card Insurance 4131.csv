1,"HC TangLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 08 Aug 2018Answer: Yes it is cheaper to pay annually as insurance company gives some discount for lump sum yearly payment.​However, income only accept 1st payment via credit card, subsequent all has to be in the form of bank transfer / cheque. (Source: https://www.income.com.sg/contact-us/premium-payment-methods) ​So your policy is with the rest of the company and they allow credit card payment, it does have the benefits as you've said to:charge to credit card via monthly payment to be counted towards minimum spend and with the right card (cashback/miles), you can reap your rewards (like what  Jin Shun Chia said below is a good strategy). ​0 comments2"

3,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 08 Aug 2018It's about opportunity costs! Let me give an example.​Say if I am using OCBC 360 for my savings and to clock extra 0.5%p.a. interest on my existing savings, I need to spend $500 monthly on my credit card. ​My insurance premiums happen to be $500/month so when I swipe the card I get the interest! But if I pay year I actually save 2%, i.e. $120 a year.​Then again, I've like $30,000 in my OCBC 360 and if I swipe card I don't need to spend money on other stuff to get the 0.5%p.a. interest ya? So I'll get $150.​In this case, I'll just leave the premiums in monthly mode, no need to change to annual mode.0 comments1"
