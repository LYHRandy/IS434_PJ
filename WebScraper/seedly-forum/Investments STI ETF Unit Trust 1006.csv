1,"Darren ChewLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Jun 2019Why don't you consider buying bank shares instead? As the 3 banks have around 40% to 50% weightage in STI. It indirectly means that when the bank stock move, STI is expected to move in the same direction as them.
Next is that STI currently is still below 2008 high, but all the 3 bank stocks had already crossed their 2008 peak. Furthermore, bank stocks give better dividend than STI ETF. One of the reasons why STI underperform banks stock could be that STI comprise of several non-performance stock that drag down its performance.
Thus if you would to look at risk and return perspective, bank shares may be a better option than STI in the longer term.0 comments9"

GeniusAnswered on 11 Jun 2019It depends on which angle you are looking at.. both are similar in being a diversified portfolio on singapore bluechip.If your capital is small, buying a unit trust on poems will be better as it is zero commission, zero platform fee. So imagine if you put $1000, the whole $1000 will be invested. For STI etf you still have to pay commission like any other stocksHowever if the UT performance is bad (underperform the index).. then no choice go for the ETF0 comments8"

However personally, I would instead go into roboadvisors for a more diversified portfolio and easier managing of risk profile suited for yourself.Both STI ETF and Aberdeen Singapore Equity Fund both have significant weightage on financial companies. Both funds are rather defensive and there's limited potential for growth. For instance STI ETF weighs the basket of blue chip companies via market capitalisation which may inadvertently over allocate for the over-valued companies and neglect the undervalued (through no fault of its own).0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 11 Jun 2019Since you are just starting out your investment journey, any particular reasons why you would like to put your money into STI or Singapore Equity UT?I would say that both aren't very optimal choices except for the fact that it is denominated in SGD and you have little or no FX risk when investing into such investments.There are other options out there such as S&P500, NASDAQ, QQQ that may yield better returns with similar risk. Moreover, both options which you suggested have limited upside potential, and over weightage on a single geographical region and Industry (Financials).Perhaps you should speak to a trusted financial advisor, or your close friends who have been investing in the markets to get a better idea of the various options that you have!If you would like to, you may always reach out to me via my facebook at  https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chen0 comments0"
