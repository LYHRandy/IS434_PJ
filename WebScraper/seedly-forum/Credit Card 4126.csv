1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 May 2019OCBC Plus! Visa is not a cashback card, hence there is no cap, or ""maximum"" cash back. You earn rebates in the form of cash rebates and LinkPoints by shopping at NTUC. Note that there is a minumum spend of $500 in places outside NTUC before the full range of rebates and LinkPoints can be unlocked.0 comments0"
