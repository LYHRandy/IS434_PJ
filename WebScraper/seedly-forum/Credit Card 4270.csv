question,"Credit Card Asked by ZongzongAsked on 24 Oct 2018What's the best credit card for foreign currency spends? I do quite a bit of online shopping but mostly are not SGD currency. (Or, maybe debit cards are still the best?)When asking this question, I'm also curious about all the admin charges when you charge foreign currencies to your credit cards. It's about 2-3% on your purchase, which is a lot and that will eat up all your cashback and miles.So maybe, a multi-currency account debit card is still the best choice?2 answersAnswerBump1"
