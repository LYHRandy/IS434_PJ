1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018I carry a mix of cashback and miles credit cards - 80% cashback cards, 20% miles cards. Not gonna reveal them here, cos I've done so at a previous Seedly event already :P and also because I don't want people to just copy the cards I have thinking that they're the best just because Budget Babe carries them! One should always find the best credit card for their own lifestyle and spending habits.that's because I'm more of Camp Cashback! I use my miles card only occasionally where the promotions are worth it.have written about it here:http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2018/01/the-ultimate-guidebook-to-best-cashback.html​Yes I'm always on the lookout for promotions but very few cards convince me to switch. Often, they might be great but just not suitable for my lifestyle. Eg. BOC Family Card is great, but can you meet the minimum spend? =/​You can also download my free Cashback credit card app which I developed with a reader for users to find out which will be the best card for you! http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2018/03/the-sgbb-cashback-app.html0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I go to card will be DBS Live Fresh card as it gives me 10% cashback (min $600 spend) - applied it during a promotion. ​I constantly leverage on the new customers promotion from the banks and cancel my card if I don't use them (easier for me to hit the new customer criteria in future) 0 comments0
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I just carry the DBS Altitude. As I just graduated recently, I find it hard to hit the minimum spending that some credit cards require. Thus, I got one that does not require any minimum spendings, and with benefits that suit my needs!0 comments0"
