question,"Insurance Asked by Lucas OngAsked on 11 Dec 2018Is it more advisable to increase coverage of an existing plan or purchase an additional one?From my understanding, it's important to not over-pay in life insurance premiums and only cover what is necessary, especially if one doesn't have the income to keep up with the payments. However, when we reach a new life stage, adjustment is needed. Which of the above choices is more feasible (easier execution, cost-efficient, etc.)?3 answersAnswerBump1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 11 Dec 2018Most policies will not allow you to increase coverage after 6 months. If your policy has that option, I would suggest you take it, because it may come without additional underwriting.If your policy doesn't allow for it, your only choice is to get another plan.0 comments1"

But in terms of cost, they are essentially similar. It will still be based on your current age. Honestly, I do not see any material difference that should be of your concern. What is more important will be to find a plan more suited to what u require. You might want to seek a competitively priced Term insurance for your needs. The mindef group term is one, and other is direct insurance products. 0 comments0"

But the premiums are not gauranteed to be the same as what you are already covered.The term plans really depend on your age. If you are below 30s, a Whole Life and Term plan may not differ much in terms of ROI (return of investment). But if you are older, consider term life since it will most likely be cheaper to invest difference.You may also consider decreasing term life insurance (where the first 5 years is a significant cheaper as compared to level term life insurance). if you only require 5-10 years of insurance coverage.
