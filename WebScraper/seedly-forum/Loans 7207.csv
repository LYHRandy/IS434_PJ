question,"Loans Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 Nov 2018Anyone tried partial repayment of DBS tuition loan before?I am currently about $30k in debt for tuition loan, in my final year now. Will end school around Apr 2019. I have some cash on hand, probably about half to pay off the student loan. I'm wondering will the interest rate still be applicable for the first half of the payment that I've made? Or just the remaining payment?I'm thinking what are the odds of me being able to pay off the debt, interest free. I currently have a side income of about 1k a month. Any advice will be appreciated, thank you!3 answersAnswerBump0"

3,"Question Poster09 Nov 2018TS here, i'm just wondering for now till my repayment next year, is there anything I can do with the lump sump of 15k? can i yield some interest at least if i put into a saver account like CIMB fast saver?Jim Ng09 Nov 2018Given your scenario, I suggest you place it in Singapore Savings Bonds. It's returns are higher than any savings accounts out there.
The returns are guaranteed and it is fully backed by the government.
It is also fully liquid.

MasterAnswered on 10 Nov 2018Yes you can pay off the first half without incurring interest so long as you have not graduated yet since the interest only kicks in upon you graduate. In fact, try to clear off your student loan as soon as possible especially upon graduation so as to reduce the amount of interest payable.0 comments0"
