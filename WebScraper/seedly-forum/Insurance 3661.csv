question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Sep 2019What should I do with my Investment-Linked Plan policy that I bought from my friend who is working with AIA?Last year, there wasn't Seedly and I don't have anyone around me to help me with my financial planning. So I bought ILP because I thought it would benefit me in some way. However, today I read the article on seedly that we shouldn't buy ILP. What should I do now? Please help.3 answersAnswerBump1"

God of WisdomUpdated on 03 Sep 2019Maybe you might want to go back to your AIA agent and ask why she recommended the policy to you.Now that you understand a little bit more about insurance, you can ask her better questions and ask why didn't she recommend the alternatives.ILP doesn't automatically mean bad. And there are honestly many types of ILPs.A few things to note would be how much of your premiums go to the cost of insurance and how much gets invested, and what does it get invested in.What would the plan be when you turn 60 and above when Cost Of Insurance get quite expensive, what kind of returns can I expect from my investment and the investment strategy to reach there.If you don't have access to your previous agent, you may want to speak to an Independent Financial Advisor to understand what your options could be.0 comments3"

MasterAnswered on 17 Sep 2019Firstly, it's always about suitability.ILPs are merely one of the many tools or investment solutions that one can take up!If one prefers passive investments, No doubt that ILPs may have higher charges or cost. However, the net returns that you eventually achieve (if managed properly) could actually be much higher than that of other options such as Robo-advisors, Index Funds etc. Most importantly is whether your adviser is able to manage your portfolio and conduct regular reviews to ensure that your portfolio is aligned with your goals/objective!At the end of the day, what matters more is the advisor's abilities to manage your portfolio! Should you decide the cancel, it is highly probable that you may lose the bulk of initial investment! The second question you should ask yourself is should you decide to cancel, will the alternatives be able to recoup the loss from early cancellation0 comments0"

Always focus on what is your objective. Then check whether it's worth it to cancel it now, and do your own DIY, or continue with the policy (and do your figures).You might want to be interested in my next event on Investment Regrets: Why Fees Matter. Look out for it.0 comments0"
