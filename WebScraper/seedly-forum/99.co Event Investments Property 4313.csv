WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019The only way is buying industrial and commercial properties as these 2 classes of properties don't attract ABSD for now.But u need some fire power aka ammo since you can't use CPF for it. and (Total Debt Servicing Ratio) TDSR still apply to you if you are buying as an individual. If u buy as a company, than the financials of the company must be strong enough to secure bank loans.​​​
