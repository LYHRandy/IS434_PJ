God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Apr 2019Depends if there are any fixed purchasing cost of your investments. If its like 10 dollars everytime you buy, then of course 1200 a year to only pay that 10 dollars once.If there are no entry costs, and I'm intending to dollar cost average my investment, I'd invest every month or every quarter instead.0 comments0"
