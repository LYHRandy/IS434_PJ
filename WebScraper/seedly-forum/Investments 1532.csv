Grand MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Pro: Diversify is always good for those who prefer a heahlthy risk-return ratio.Con: you won't get the ultimate winning stock that makes you a few hundred percentages. But thats probably a good thing (its probably 1 in 100 chance)0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Apr 2019Both!We truly cannot know which country or industry would be the next driver of performance and innovation.It's always best to just stay as diversified across the globe as possible. You may miss out on short term growth but studies already show, we can't continuously time the markets and make more money than being diversified.So just stay invested globally, invest in relatively cheaper companies, and profitable ones, you can't go wrong in the long term.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Diversifying across different geographies, but the same industry may not necessarily yield the appropriate amount of diversification of unsystematic risk as compared to within the same geographical location, but different industries. Why this is so is because diversification benefits are created from stocks which are less correlated to one another - buying 50 highly correlated stocks (meaning if the stock A rises $1, stock B rises by about $1 as well) will not be as good at removing risk relative to buying jsut 10 highly uncorrelated stocks, as the up of one stock cushions the down of another, and vice versa.purchasing different geographical markets but in the same industry will yield very similar performing stocks, especially in sectors that are very globalized and connected such as financial services. It is much better to buy into 1 single geographical market, and then spread out your risk over multiple industries, since this will allow you to only take on that market's systematic risk (or beta).0 comments0"
