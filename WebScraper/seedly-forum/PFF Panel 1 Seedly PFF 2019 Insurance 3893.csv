There are cost Involved, and the only person who can tell you to surrender should have a plan on how to recoup this amount (Time value calculated too), based on What type of gauranteed returns etc.Have a BTIR comparison (like how https://www.firepathlion.com/i-threw-away-10000-by-canceling-my-whole-life-insurance-and-it-was-worth-it/ did,) in order to understand your options.0 comments0"

From what it looks like, your WL plan will be breaking even soon and unless you're bleeding trying to pay for it, you may want to keep it and still get term on top.0 comments0"
