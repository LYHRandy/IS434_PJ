question,"Bank Account Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Sep 2019Which investment option should I undertake for DBS Multiplier Account?Hi everyone, I’ve recently opened a DBS Multiplier Account. On top of the crediting of my monthly salary and credit card spending, I’m hoping to jump to the next tier of interest rate by undertaking the “investment” transaction. Some friends told me about buying SSBs consecutively for 6 months to get a monthly dividend. But the current interest rate for SSB seems rather low....? Any advice?1 answerAnswerBump0"

If you are young with an ok risk appetite without any liquidity concern I would recommend taking up the STI index. If you foresee yourself needing the fund within the next 2-3 years horizon, then SSBs might be a good option.0 comments0"
