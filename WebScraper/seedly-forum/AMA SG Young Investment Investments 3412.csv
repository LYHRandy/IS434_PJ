1,"Nicholes WongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2018Price to book ratio can tell, less than 1 is undervalued and more than 1 is overvalued technically. However, its not that straight forward because certain companies can have quite high PB ratio but still good to invest in. Cant tell you more not too sure as well. You also have to see why the company is undervalue before buying the shares just because its undervalue. 0 comments2"
