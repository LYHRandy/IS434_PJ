1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Institutional and individual investors use the futures market as a predictive guide. For instance, the fed fund futures. If one thinks the Fed will raise rates, he would sell the futures. If one thinks the Fed will lower rates, he will buy these futures contracts. The futures market indicates the market sentiment. Additionally, since futures market help investors limit losses and increase value, the supply and demand ultimately determines the prices of stocks. Since the risks are reduced because the price is pre-set, investors are informed how much they will need to buy or sell. This reduces the cost to the investor as there is less risk.0 comments0"
