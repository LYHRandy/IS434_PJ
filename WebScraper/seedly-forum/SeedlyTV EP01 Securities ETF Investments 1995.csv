1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Another form of risk is from transaction expenses. To rebalance the ETF portfolio according to the index, there also transactions expenses relating to the buying or selling of shares. These expenses may not be revealed in the performance of the index, but it is something to take note of because these expenses basically erode your returns. Another form of risk that you might want to take note of is also exchange rate risk, if you are investing in an ETF overseas. This is just the risk that occurs from changes in the exchange rate, which is a risk that all overseas investments or ventures will always involve. This probably means more active management of your portfolio, and more caution about where the currency is moving towards.0 comments2"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Mar 2019Hello!some risks of ETFs are1) Liquidity risk
Should an ETF be thinly traded,  there  maybe problems getting out of the investment, depending on the size of your position in relation to the average trading volume.  Thus, it is best to make sure that an ETF is liquid before buying. 2) Capital gains distribuitionIn some instances, ab ETF will distribute capital gains to its shareholders. This may not be desirable fo ETF shareholders since shareholders are responisble for the captial gains tax. 3) Issues of controlWhen investing in an ETF, you will usually not have any say in the individual stocks in an ETF's underlying index. Thus, should you be wanting to avoid a certain company or industry does not have the same level of control as an investor focused on individual stocks.0 comments1"
3,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Mar 2019Hello!Some risks in investing in ETFs include market risk and index risk. For market risk, If you buy an S&P500 ETF and the S&P goes down, you will also make a loss. Index risk refers to the lack of active management of the fund. Since ETFs are not actively managed, it will not sell a security if the security is in financial trouble. This means the ETF will move up and down with the index and the ETF manager will not take defensive positions, or sell losing positions in a market downturn.0 comments0"
