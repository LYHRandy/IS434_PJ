1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Jul 2019I can answer this from a Reviews POV. I was reading through some of his reviews on the Seedly Reviews platform. Does not look very promising...You can read all his reviews here: https://seedly.sg/reviews/investment-courses/dr-tee-ein55Here's the top one: ""Promised use of free software which he claims he developed himself, but he did not say it was free only for the duration of the course. After the course you have to pay to subscribe or pay to attend higher level courses.  Claims to have developed many different ""styles"" of investing, but in actual fact, it is just giving his own name to what is already available in public.  Throughout the 5 days, more than half the time he talks about some other stories, and upselling his other courses. Not much time is dedicated to real teaching. And after the 5 days, you will often receive emails from him promoting other investment ""courses"".  Recommend to avoid, unless you have spare cash ($1000) to throw and don't mind listening to an old man boasting about himself. ""0 comments0"
