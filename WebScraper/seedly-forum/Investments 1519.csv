1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Apr 2019I don't think so, because at the end of the day, Shark Tank is a show. In the real world of venture investments, some companies may be issued term sheets, but not 100% of these deals get funded.0 comments2"

It's all part of business.Even in reality, if you get an investor in your business, it doesn't mean things will work out. Some fail, some succeed. And they learn from their failure. Sometimes the market doesn't see the need for a certain product or service, sometimes a product is just a hype hence the shark tank business fails.There are even cases the investor and the owner are not able to agree on certain things so they fall out and the owner loses the investor. The shark tank investor most of the time gets a stake in the business but not enough to be a controlling shareholder. They provide advice and connections but if the owner does not listen or act on it, things can still go wrong.0 comments0"
