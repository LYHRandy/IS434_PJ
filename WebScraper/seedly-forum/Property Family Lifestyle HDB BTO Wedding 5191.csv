Stay with in-law or stay on our own, which is better?Me (PR) and my boyfriend (SGP) have been planning to get a BTO. However, we have some conflict when it comes to selecting the size of the flat, 4 room or 5 room.We went to see the show flat and I personally prefer to have 5 room flat. However, my bf plans to rent out the flat and we will stay with his parents. I told him that I wish to stay on our own.His parents also want us to stay with them. Shall I insist to have 5 room? Shall I stay together with his parents? Any advice?1 answerAnswerBump1"

Grand MasterUpdated on 13 Sep 2019Renting out 5room still gets you more rental income than 4roomit's sort of a grey scheme to get cash out of of your CPF- you finance your home with CPF payment, but you get cash payments from the tenants =)If it's me, just that alone will convince me to buy the 5 room because it will be 4 rooms available for rental (after you satisfied the MOP, of course. if not, it will be 3rooms, since you need 1 room for your residential stay for 5 yrs)Check with your bf's reason for smaller flat, he may be worried of the first downpayment (not enough CPF or cash) or renovation, or the interests in the long run.Do the maths with him. In the long run, rental of more rooms definitely justify the extra interests and payment for a bigger flat. (this is why every business wants to do bigger scale, not smaller scale)On the other personal matter:-Renting out and staying with parents are going to be very good financially... but you will lose some privacy, some leisure. It's a wise move financially...5 comments2"

A bigger home is actually a bigger expenses and worse financial decision BUT... you are renting it out, so its not an expense, but becoming an income-producing asset."
