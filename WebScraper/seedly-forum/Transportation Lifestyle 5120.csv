2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019As their income is fluatuating (Self-employed), they will need to be more prudent in their spending and income. They should be able to take home $3,000 nett for driving about 10 hours for 6 days if i am not wrong. (could be more or less depending).The good thing about taxi driving is that inherently, they are able to claim business expenses on the following:1) Vehicle Rental Fee2) Driving licence Fee3) Vocational licence Fee4) Parking Fees5) Vehicle Washing Expenses6) Diesel Expenses7) ERP (that is paid by taxi driver)Non-tax deductible expenses are1) Food, household and medical expenses2) Entertainment expenses3) Traffic fines4) CPF contributionsFor them to be salaried workers, they need a company that hires them as a driver and they ferry passengers.2 comments0"
