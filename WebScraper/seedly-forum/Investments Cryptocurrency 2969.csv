Would like to seek advice in this areas.My overall portfolio for Cryptos is down 60-70%. Would like to seek for advice in this area. For my pulsar, I am currently invested in 40%- Fundsmith, 30% - Blackrock healthscience and 30%- Franklin tech. Is the fund allocation decent enough? Also, I was thinking of surrendering my endowment plan which I have paid for 3 years, to put better use of my money into investment. Will lose around 2k upon surrendering.2 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 06 Dec 2018Your Pulsar allocation is heavily concentrated and less diversified - as it should be, since you need to make a lot in order to overcome the fees. Its best not to think of it as anything other than a 20 year long plan, even if you can afford to pay less than that. For crypto, you may want to keep more of the currency that has been declared 'finite' while opting out of most of the other currencies. The market bubble for most of them has popped - and while we can both agree that blockchain has a future, there wont be one for the majority of currencies. 0 comments0"
