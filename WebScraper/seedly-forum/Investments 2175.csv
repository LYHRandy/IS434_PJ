However it requires Yuan to finance it's investment in China. It can do so by borrowing at a high rate of 10%.A Chinese company can borrow Chinese Yuan for 3%. However it requires American Dollars to finance it's invesment in US. It can do so by borrowing at a high rate of 9%.What these 2 companies can do is to just swap their loans (principal + interest).Benefit of this swap is that:Lower interest rate payableAvoid volatility in exchange rateBetter planning from knowing how much to pay back0 comments0
