1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Firstly you need to know how you handle money, and what is your risk profile. If yours is something more conservative, consider something like SSB or a bond fund. If you have a bigger risk appetite, perhaps look into a basket of s-reits, dividend yielding stocks, Etfs or going into robo advisories. If yours is an aggressive one, consider paying to attend an investment workshop on options portfolio management. Returns can be had at 30% onwards for this.1 comment0"
