1,"SKShabir KhanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019First thing you want to so is set-up a brokerage account with the many brokers in Singapore, such as DBS Vickers, Maybank Kim Eng etc, all of the brokers have access to the U.S Market so choose them based on fees and other markets that you would like to invest in. This gives you access to buy the S&P 500 and many other ETFs listed in U.S market, you can invest them through the online websites that this brokerages have.1 comment1"
