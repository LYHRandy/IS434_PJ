1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Apr 2019Mostly not taking a committed step towards doing something concrete. Can be as simple as putting aside a dollar a day to save up, or limiting yourself to 1 bottled drink a day - every little thing counts. i think the general problem is that we always dream big, but do not understand the sacrifices we have to make in order to get there - Dreams only become reality with hard work and most importantly dedication. i think we all have experienced that new year resolution sprint that ends in a fizzle of non-commitment and lack of time by February!So start small first, and work your way up - But just have a goal in mind, and remember to reward yourself now and again for that discipline! intrinsic motivation is good and all, but a good meal here and there adds the cherry on top of all the investments you have made!

3,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Apr 2019Hello!i think that one of the biggest mistakes made would be when people live from paycheck to paycheck. It is essential to save some of your savings be it for rainy days or as emergency funds. Living from paycheck to paycheck is rather dangerous since you will not have any savings should anything have happened to your job. The other big mistake that people make would be that they do not invest. Investing will be able to help you to grow your money so as to keep up with inflation and maybe even help you acheive your financial goals. It is important to start as early as possible. In terms of investing, people should not be afraid to take risks. every investment comes with risks, so it is essential that you will not be afraid to take on some form of risk.0 comments0"
