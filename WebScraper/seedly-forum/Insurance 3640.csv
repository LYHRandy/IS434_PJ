God of WisdomAnswered 4w agoHello,I'm sorry to hear that your friend was diagnosed with SLE. It's a disease that usually requires lifelong medication.I have seen similar cases before, as I have tried to get critical illness coverage for a client of mine who was also diagnosed with SLE, but all insurers basically came back and told me that they were not able to insure her. So at this stage, she will definitely need to rely on any policies that her parents might have bought for her when she was young, and she will have to ensure they do not lapse.I would suggest that she would have to start her investment journey already to work on her goals such as retirement, as there is little that can be done on the insurance side. That was what my other client did as well. However, there are many asset classes and options that are available, so it would be good for your friend to sit down with an independent financial advisor to discuss her aspirations and goals so that a concrete strategy can be worked out for her. Of particular importance for her is also to ensure a larger emergency fund kept accessible as she might not have adequate insurance payout in the event of other critical illnesses in future. If she would like to take a look at the options and strategies available for her financial planning with regards to investment and preparing for retirement, she can reach out to me at elijahleest@phillip.com.sg and I can see how I can assist.0 comments7"
