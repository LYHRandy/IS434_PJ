I would firstly think how long I could be in them. I could hold them for longer term if I determine the trend could be far longer, the yield can be attractive at this price paid, and the value is undemanding.  In general I try to have high conviction plays that I understand well, that I can stay in for longer with less effort.Other than this, usually it starts off by seeing that the outlook seems to have tilted towards more positive. Then I will think about whether the guys behind this stock is cooking up the stock. Or whether this company has always been a good stock just that their results was not good. For the former, I would measure my position and be quick to be out. For the later I might stay in longer, while taking time to dig if there is a longer momentum0 comments0"
