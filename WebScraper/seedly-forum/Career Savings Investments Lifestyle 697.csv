WizardAnswered on 12 Aug 2019Do both as we need Higher income which brings higher savings to be the capital for investment and all other things but we also cannot just rely on main income alone to increase much wealth without investment. 1) Investment learning : Beside reading , save towards attending some of the recommended courses for investment. This is long term so need to continue learning. 2) License cert: find company sponsor or use your skillfuture credits to sign up for courses, there's also discount for Citizen for some license course. Google to find out more. This is short term easier to achieve and helps boost income and hence savings as your capital for investment in #1. Cheers üòÉüëç0 comments0"
