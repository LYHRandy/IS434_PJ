1,"Dominic ChangLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jun 2018I work around this issue using other means to save. First I use BOC credit card for its cash back, but due to no salary credit bonus, I stuck with OCBC frank giving me 0.2%, and usually keep the bulk in SSB or buy stocks/REITS. If I do need emergency funds, I can swipe my credit card first then redeem my SSB to pay the bills. WIth this general strategy, my bank account does not have too much cash. 0 comments1"

Thus, I'd recommend you to make use of CIMB FastSaver which offers 1% interest, no other conditions other than maintaining at least $1k. It allows you to make immediate transfers via FAST for free so you don't have to worry about your money being stuck in that account0 comments0"
