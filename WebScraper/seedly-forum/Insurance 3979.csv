1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My advice by rank of priority.1) Any health shield upgrade from medishield life. This will protect your assets from being used by health care expenses.2) Do the same for your kid. Enroll him/her into an upgrade. Even if you are cash strap, you can choose 1 without rider (cash payment).3) Term life insurance. Depending on how long you want to cover and the coverage.4) Disability income (only if your job has high income).5) Accident to top up for in case of TPD occur from accident. 1 comment1"
2,"Yinglin Chua11 Dec 2018Agree with Tat Tian. If your job is slightly high risk - e.g. on the road often, or has long working hours (as such, prone to accidents and falls), do move up the accident policy as it's cheap and there are, in the market, where you you cover the parents and all the children are covered for free. If moderate to high income, Aviva currently has a disability income policy promotion with 35% perpetual waiver for consideration till end of year 2018, if am not wrong."
3,"Karyee SeeLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 11 Dec 2018Hello! First of all, congratulations on becoming a dad!If you currently do not have any form of insurance, your priority for yourself would definitely be a hospitalisation plan. This is an essential plan to get to cover any hospital expenses, and enhancing your coverage with a cash rider (top up) is very affordable.Other than that, the type of insurance that should be your priority would be a term life plan, followed by a critical illness plan. A term life plan ensures that in case of death (touch wood), your family would still be able to receive a sum assured. This is especially important for you to get since your family is a single-income family. The second insurance is a critical illness plan, which can pay out a sum assured in case any critical illness is discovered. This is to ensure that in case you're sick and unable to work, your family lifestyle would not be compromised and you can focus on recovering during this period.If you have any other questions, I'd love to help you :) You can drop me a message on Facebook!0 comments0"
