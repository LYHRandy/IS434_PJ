God of WisdomAnswered 3d agoHi anon,This year's ERS is $264K, so to have that amount in 9 years, you'll need to top up approximately $10.5K to your RA this year and let compounding do the rest.Do note that the ERS goes up next year to $271.5K and if you want that amount in 9 years, then you'll have to top up another $15K.Herein lies the problem, we do not know the ERS amount in 9 years from now as figures have only been annouced till 2020. You are allowed to top up to the year's prevailing ERS each year as the quantum for the topup does not include the interest earned. If your goal is actually to maintain yourself at ERS or even more, consider doing topups yearly where possible to allow for interest to boost your balances further.1 comment6"

Based on the 3% yearly increment on the retirement sums the past few years, the projected Enhanced Retirement Sum, when you reach age 65 in 2028, will be $343,928. Since I'm not sure of your current cash flow, there are a few scenarios for your contributions:1) Lump-sum of $70k and let compound interest handle the rest!2) $20k per year over the next 4 years3) $15k per year over the next 5 yearsThe above was a basic excel sheet that I created previously to calculate how much we'll need to earn to hit FRS, but it does not include the extra 1% interest on the first 60k, and the extra 1% interest for members above age 55. Which means the amount you'll need is a little lesser!1 comment1"
