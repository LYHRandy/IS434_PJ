1,"CPF BoardLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Jun 2019Hi Gabriel,
CPF monies are invested in Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS) which are guaranteed by the Government. This assures that CPF savings are safe, regardless of financial market conditions. The coupon rates which these SSGS earn for the CPF Board match the interest rates that CPF members receive. SSGS are non-tradable bonds issued specifically to CPF Board for the investment of CPF monies.Thank you.0 comments8"
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 13 Jun 2019If u are refering to the SSGS that CPFB 'buys'. No you can't buy them, no one else can buy them. It is 'special' for that reason. =DCPF monies are invested by the CPF Board (CPFB) in Special Singapore Government Securities (SSGS7) that are issued and guaranteed by the Singapore Government. By law, the monies collected with SGS or SSGS cannot be used in government spendings.  The proceeds from SSGS are invested by the Government via MAS and GIC.0 comments1"
