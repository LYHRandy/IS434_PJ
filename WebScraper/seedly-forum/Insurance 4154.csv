1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 08 May 2018Life insurance of 101k = how many times of your annual salary? If it is insufficient, can your agent increase this coverage for you? Most insurers will allow increment of coverage on existing policy.​Can you get CI riders on existing policy? ​Amount of coverage depends on how much you can afford. Do not go for too much coverage if the premiums are killing you.​To go for term insurance or not? This depends on what you plan to do with the extra savings from going term insurance. Yes, term insurance is way cheaper but do you have an investment plan to grow your extra savings? Whole life insurance has an investment portion for people who are not able to invest the money themselves or are just lacking the knowledge.​Do a policy comparison across other insurers. Can you get the similar policy with desired coverage with CI at a cheaper rate? ​​0 comments1"

But if you do decide to purchase Term, do also remember to invest the difference.As for your death coverage, if you have liabilities such as house or children, perhaps you can use that to decide your coverage that you require, rather than just 10 to 15 times of income.Drop me an email at Brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg and I would be happy to assist you with a review. No obligations to purchase.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 10 May 2018Hi there, ​I do agree with Gabriel Tham on his points as mentioned.  ​I would like to add that​Most term insurance only covers for certain period before you are subjected to underwriting upon renewal when your term ends. However some term insurance allows you to convert a Whole Life at no medical underwriting when you have more Budget.I would like to emphasise that with Buy Term and Invest the Rest strategy, it is essential for you make a good return in your investment every year to have enough and cover you for old age and long term care. Most people buy Term and spend the rest instead. ​TLDR, if Budget is tight, get Term and convert when your Budget is better In the future.​I'm an AIA agent myself. If you need a quotation, you can drop me an email (gabrielgrantt@aia.com.sg) ​All the best!0 comments0"
