2,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 26 Jun 2019BTO!Start with BTO and later upgrade to an EC at later times with some profit from sales proceed of BTO will be much managable. It's like we all start small somewhere and scale it later as income increases. There quite a few subsidy we can enjoy with starting income that makes it suitable. If you are not going to upgrade anymore and gonna stay in the EC for the rest of your life , then go for EC if financially is not too taxing for a start to avoid buying / selling cost associated.

6,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Jun 2019It actually depends on what you are looking for.Assuming the same price point, more spacious, then BTO.
If you want facilities like GYM, Swimming pool, BBQ pits, function room, then EC.For investment purpose, definitely EC. Once allowed to resell after MOP, EC will surely have big profit compared to BTO.
Enbloc potential, also EC.0 comments0"
