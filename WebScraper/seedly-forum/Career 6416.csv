WizardAnswered on 29 May 2019Hi Anon!Let me do my best to answer you below.We hope to become something like the TripAdvisor for Personal Finance in SEA, starting here in Singapore. A giant knowledge base and one-stop of all things personal finance related.There are many online advertising models we could adopt (CPM, CPC, CPA), but for us now, it's to become Singapore's largest crowd-sourced knowledge center for all things personal finance realted, and I do hope that we're on the way there.Not really rocket science!To get a better understanding of this concept, do jump in and check out:Seedly QnA: https://seedly.sg/questionsSeedly Reviews: https://seedly.sg/reviewsYou can access our other tools and resource guides:Seedly Mobile App: https://get.seedly.sg/appSeedly Blog: https://blog.seedly.sg0 comments4"
