1,"Huang Yixuan, Product Designer at SomewhereLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 May 2019Heyhey!For me, I got a Krisflyer Amex card first, that gives me about 15k sign up bonus with 3k spent in the first 3 months. So total about 18k already.After a few months, I got the Citipremier miles card, because the miles don't expire, and has higher mpd, (1.2mpd compared to AMEX which is 1mpd)Citibank also has a sign up bonus of 23k with 7k of expenditure in 3 months, if you pay the annual fee of ~$200.So now I would have gotten 18k+30k = 48k miles from these two cards alone, and by paying the $200 annual fee. 50k miles get you to south africa and melbourne! So this method is quite worth it imo if you can hit the min spending (:0 comments2"
