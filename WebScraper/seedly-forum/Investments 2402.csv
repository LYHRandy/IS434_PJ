Won't lose money unless govt and Singapore die.Stable returns for the next 10 years.$2 transaction fee on buying or early withdrawal.1 Month withdrawal period. Quite fast if you suddenly need it.Just need a CDP account and bank account linked to CDP.0 comments0"
2,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 07 Mar 2019Interesting question... 2k is not alot but it's a good start :) You can either choose the following ideas:Put into a High savings yield savings account (eg CIMB Fast Saver with 1% p.a with no strings attached) and wait till you get more funds (more than 5k-ish) Reason being that it will be more cost effective to invest at that amount due to brokerage fees. Then I would study up in the meantime about REITs and high dividend stocks to get ready :)Put into SSB (around 1.5 to 2% p.a) but depends if you want to wait for 10 years, there is no downside to thisStart a STI ETF (around 5-7% p.a) and you should split up this $2000 into a $100 a month RSP (regular savings plans) with any of the 4 providers, you can find out more at this link: https://blog.seedly.sg/which-regular-savings-plan-is-the-cheapest/0 comments0"
