question,"Lifestyle Credit Card Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 02 Apr 2019I have a white DBS LiveFresh Credit Card (Student) & also a black DBS Visa Debit Card. I'm just confused between the two, which should I use for paying things to receive the most cashback? I've graduated recently, found a job & started on my little personal finance journey. I hv a Multiplier acct, so I know to hit 1 of e criteria, its min $1 spend on credit card. But sometimes when i go for meals/restaurants I dont know which card to use to get e most cashback. This is assuming i have sufficient funds in my acct and i dont really need to 'pay for stuff by credit' (cuz mum say thats borrowing from banks, nt gd)PS: recently trying to pay for stuff via Grabpay to receive points too2 answersAnswerBump1"

ProdigyAnswered on 02 Apr 2019You should look at Maybank eVibes Credit Card, it’s a student card, with $500 limit and it gives you 1% cash back on everything spend, even though not the highest, it’s still better then 0.3%.0 comments1"
