While it was a ton of fun (.... & pain), the up-front costs for a 1 year membership is too much - almost $4200 a year! Any other options to recommend?1 answerAnswerBump1"

It's more of the typical gym stuff, for now!)Or signing up to GuavaPass and getting the monthly sessions. You can try out the trial first, I believe there are also the MMA activities you can do also.0 comments0"
