God of WisdomUpdated 3w agoHi, this question is a little too general and cannot be answered directly. You will have to consider your risk profile, your budget, your objective for this money, when you need the funds, and many other factors.In general, I do not advise mixing investment with insurance. I have written about this before, and you can take a look at some of my past answers, e.g. https://seedly.sg/questions/is-axa-wealth-accelerate-a-good-ilp-planI would recommend that you speak to an independent advisor to determine what might be your best way forward. Or you could provide more details to me and I can give you a more detailed analysis/opinion.0 comments6"
