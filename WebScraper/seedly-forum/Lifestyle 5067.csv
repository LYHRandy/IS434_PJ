1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Nov 2018I think you might not like what i am saying at the start...What happen to emergency funds, accident insurance, and third party claim on accident (if it is claimable a not) from the other party?(1) seek out help, anywhere. Could be from Community Care or other organisations which could possibly give you some life line for the time being. OR even approach your RC for help for referral to other agencies for help.(2) Please prepare your emergency funds after you are financially not in debt. Even with insurance, you need this emergency fund to hedge against reinbursement type of medical expenses or accident insurance reinbursement claim. Not to mention like now, job lost or unable to work (I assume you are part-time or self-employed currently).0 comments0"
