1,"YYsLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 Jun 2019I tried it before. It uses AI to pull data together and visualise the results automatically based on the preset rules in the algorithm.Have a read on their blog, it seems that even the reviews are automated (i.e. very mechanical looking and doesn't tell me much).Nevertheless, the visuals are good looking and helps users to identify what's going on with the company, and also offer a good comparison to it's peers in their industry group.Do note that after the trial period, you will need to pay for subscription, or else will be limited to a few stocks to view each month. :)0 comments1"
