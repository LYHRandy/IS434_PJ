1,"Ng Lip Hong KyithLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018Fund managers would not use robo advisors. That would mean they follow the index. But to be fair there is this unhealthy behavior in the active fund management world, where they become a closet indexer. That means they buy the index and selective stocks hoping to out perform.â€‹If i am a fund manager, i would not buy robo advisors, i would go for the cheapest cost exchange traded fund that does the job, then i will shift what i save from not using a robo advisor and charge my unit trust investors as fees HAHAHAHA0 comments0"
