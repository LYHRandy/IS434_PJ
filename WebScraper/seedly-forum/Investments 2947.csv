question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Dec 2018My financial planner from Prudential introduced me to PruGolden Retirement, and I wonder if anyone has a second opinion? ?Basically I pay a premium of $10k annually for 26 years (till age 55), and between the age of 60 and 80, I will receive a guaranteed sum of $1,800 monthly + a variable bonus, depending on the performance of underlying fund. Although I can well afford it, I wonder about the opportunity cost and alternatives to such retirement plans? Or should I invest directly in the SGX (currently doing so, plus Roboadvisor)?4 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I have just done a basic calculation with CPF interest rates.If you are able to afford 10k a month into the endowment, you could have put that 10k into CPF and hit FRS easily by Age 55At Age 55, you have a balance of $130k for withdrawal from Special Account.This is a better option imho.Credits to Gabriel Loh our community contributor from Seedly6 comments0"
2,"See all 6 comments Yixiong Chang17 Dec 2018My bad, You are right on this part. I mixed up with the RA part. Anyway the interest earned before 55 or the principle topped up amount is not important in this case. Will be able to withdraw from SA in excess of the FRS regardless of source. =D 

But then We wouldnt be able to do RSTU when the SA balance hits the then FRS limit right? According to your projections, his SA balance will exceed the FRS before year 19 (without accounting for the mandatory contribution from wages). He has to wait till 55 then he can continue to top up to the ERS limit. Loh Tat Tian17 Dec 2018No problem. Anyway I have addressed your part above. I cut and paste over here again. 

He could also invest aggressively once FRS and BHS is reached. Or even buy traded endowments with 10 years maturity. These are in fact less risky but better risk adjusted returns."

Without knowing your plan's IRR, there is no way we can have a common yardstick to compare performance. The $1.8k monthly payout is meaningless if not viewed in perspective. Subsequently we can rank various solutions (from CPF to endowment to equities etc) based on their returns vs risk profile. From there we can decide and plan how to combine various solutions to meet your financial goals. From what u have written, I believe u have a good income. I am ensure your income will rise significantly as u progress. That means tax relief will benefit u greatly, there CPF and SRS will be an important tool. For eg,  for every dollar above $80k income, tax rate is 11.5%. Thus for everydollar u topped up your CPF/SRS, u get a dollar tax relief. That is effectively a 11.5% return on 'investment'. If u feel i can assist u, feel free to drop me a msg on my facebook. Or reply here with a contact method.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 14 Dec 2018Hey Anon, The good thing about retirement plans like the above are that you're guaranteeing a stream of income during your retirement years and especially in your active retirement years, usually the first 10-15 years after you stop working. Your retirement income should ideally be about 50% from a guaranteed source and 50% from a variable source like dividends or rent.It would be good to also incorporate some CPF planning as well and figuring out your anticipated cashflow at 55 after setting aside the projected Full Retirement Sum and how much CPF Life will pay you from 65 onwards. After all this, if you then want to consider retirement plans like the above to be your guaranteed stream of income, you may want to shop around for a better yield product. You may want to speak to an IFA like myself for a comparison for your options across almost all the insurers available. :) All the best.0 comments1"

GeniusAnswered on 15 Dec 2018the guaranteed irr is 1.40%compared to cpf, this is such a rubbish planyou would expect higher guaranteed returns than cpf if you get plans from the ""professionals""most likely your agent is after the comms from your 10k annual premiumsbetter avoid this agent far far0 comments1"
