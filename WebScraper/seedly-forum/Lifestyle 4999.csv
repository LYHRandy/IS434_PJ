1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 31 Dec 2018As far as I can remember,1) FitnessI was never a gym addict nor fitness enthusiast, but I always wanted to become fitter and stronger all these years. Needless to say, I failed to achieve this New Year Resolution for many years until 2018 when I was due to enlist for NS. In an attempt to reduce my NS by 2 months, I started exercising a few weeks before my pre-enlistment IPPT at Toa Payoh Stadium and as you might have guessed, I failed miserably (17 points) and had to enlist 2 months earlier and serve the full 2 years.After months of physical training, I finally managed to attain a Silver for my IPPT and also received the monetary incentive of $200! Now, I also lift weights regularly to build both my strength and muscles.On a side note, 495 days more to ORD!2) FinancesI have also always wanted to better manage my finances and make smarter financial and lifestyle decisions. Thus, I am very grateful to have found both Seedly and Shopback (Seedly Personal Finance Community & ShopBack Smarter Way Community) as I have acquired lots of valuable knowledge and learnt so much from the fellow community members which I have put to good use!I also began taking control of my finances this year where I made some changes to my portfolio and embarked on my investment journey as compared to the past where I just left my funds in a 0.05% p.a savings account. Currentlly taking baby steps and slowly gaining exposure as I'm more of a conservative and risk-averse person. Hopefully, I'll get more comfortable with taking on higher risks in 2019!In a nutshell, 2018 has been a fruitful year and I look forward to 2019! Here's wishing everyone a Happy, Blessed & Prosperous New Year ahead!0 comments0"
