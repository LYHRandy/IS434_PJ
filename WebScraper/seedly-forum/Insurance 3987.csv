MasterUpdated on 06 Dec 2018Hey, I'm pretty sure that there may be additional bonuses above the 1k per month that is guaranteed.What i understand is that you have some options on how you want to receive the bonuses:• Choice to withdraw partial or lump sum, or receive monthly income at your selected Retirement Age • Withdraw accumulated reversionary bonuses at any timeThe S$1k per month is the Guaranteed amount.If you are unsure, feel free to send me a copy of your photo link to my fb and i will respond accordingly. https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chenAnd on a separate note, this isnt exactly an annuity since you are only receiving payments for 10 years. Annuities typically mean a fixed payout for life0 comments0"
