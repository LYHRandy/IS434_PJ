God of WisdomAnswered on 21 Oct 2018For general health checkups, once every year or two should be fine.Normal checkups at a GP would be about 40 to 80 bucks. Polyclinic cheaper.If you're female, I suggest to go for a full female screening yearly, this is to detect any female related illnesses.Check up at a private gynae could cost 600 to 800 or more. There's insurance that can cover this a fraction of the cost.Same for male specific ones but the checkups are less useful. 0 comments0"
