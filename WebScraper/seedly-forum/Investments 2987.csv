1,"Emmanuel Alex WongLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 23 Apr 2019There are reasons why many here has given you advice to clear your debts first.And For some reason, you decided to do trading, you need to “perform” to make more than the interest your debt is generating.And trading includes Risks that can result in losses. These losses can be more than what you have in cash. This will further hurt your finances when you already have debts.Although the chances of making money thru trading is there which will help you clear your debts. But you should not do so in this mindset.Investing and trading is more on psychological than technical Or fundamentals.It takes a few second to execute a trade and seems like a lifetime dealing with your psyche everytime there is a movement. if you do not have the right mindset (debt-free, and with disposable income to trade) you will make some wrong decision along the way.​​​0 comments0"

3,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Oct 2018Its better you pay off debt first. Debt interest is guaranteed while investment is not. Later you lose money on investments. You will be in a even worse situation.0 comments0"
4,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Oct 2018As shared with others who have asked similar questions before, invest only with money that you can afford to lose. Also, all investments carry risks, especially since the market isn't performing very well now. Your study loan should have interest after you graduate, so it's best to try to clear it off as soon as possible to reduce the amount of interest payable. Moreover, investment returns are not guaranteed and if you fail to generate positive returns, you'll be even more in debt. 0 comments0"
5,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Oct 2018Same thoughts as Kah Hwee. This topic about repaying student loans had been previously discussed quite a couple of times in this forum.In short, your loan interest is guaranteed, but your investment returns are not.Once you graduate, your focus, financially, should be on building up a cash pool of about 6 months income/expenses to prepare for rainy days. Investment may sound like a fun thing to do, but one should only invest what they can afford to lose. From how you have described your situation, a 2k savings isnt going to last very long if you decide to be independent, hence, would recommend that you repay your loans and build up your rainy weather funds before investing!0 comments0"
6,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Oct 2018My recommendation is that you should not start trading. Clear your debts first before doing any form of investment. Your study loan compounds at a rate of ~4.75%/annum. Unless you are absolutely certain that you can get returns of more than 4.75%/annum (I don't think anyone can be absolutely certain), you are better off clearing your debts first.0 comments0"
