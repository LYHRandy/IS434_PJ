1,"Marcus TeoLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 14 Aug 2019My suggestion is to simply buy Chinese ADRs listed on NYSE. They adhere to SEC accounting rules and regulations and have been there for close to a decade.Currently they are very cheap simply because people avoid these shares during the ongoing trade war. Imo, that is the best buying opportunity in a decade. Thus, i have loaded many strong companies including BABA, JD, BZUN, BIDU and many more. There are lots of quality articles on Seeking Alpha about these companies and their fundamentals. Always stick with the best of the breed.They may continue to get cheaper in the short term. Long run, i think they will become multibaggers as China continue to ascend.

The amount you invest in must be something you are able to hold for many years without withdrawing. Also, always buy the index ahead of individual stocks until it constitutes at least 50% of your portfolio. Good luck!Question Poster14 Aug 2019I totally agree"
