1,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Feb 2019Key industries affected by the trade war are the automobile and soybean industries - especially soybeans given that China is (or was before the trade war), US's largest importer of soybean. If trade talks are favourable and end promptly on 1st March with win-win agreements it can be almost be expected that the soybean industry's demand will be greatly boosted once more in the United States. Possible companies that you can look into are Bunge Limited (BG), a Us based company with emphasis on agribusiness and a main produce that they deal with is soybeans. Currently, Bunge's stock prices have fallen to USD 52 at the time of writing, which is about 2 dollars shy of the 52-week low. This could prove to be a worthy investment that can be monitored on your watchlist.0 comments0"
