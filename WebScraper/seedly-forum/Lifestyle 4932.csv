1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 15 Mar 2019We wanted to buy 3 x matteress from JB which were made in Malaysia but under a reputable brand... I think it was Serta or something. But at the end of the day, because we were getting them to transport it over to SG, there was an import tax which needed to be paid.Thus we did not go ahead with it in the end! But that is for the matteress, so I'm not entirely sure about other stuff like Sofa etc.0 comments0"
