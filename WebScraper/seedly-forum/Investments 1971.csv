1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019I guess when you mentioned government, you're probably referring to Temasek / GIC. Temasek once had a 4+% stake in Hyflux back in 2003 but subsequently reduced it's position to less than 1% in 2005. Therefore I believe it would rather write-off this as a bad debt than to try and rescue it0 comments0"
