God of WisdomAnswered on 17 Sep 2019I think you are referring to how often you will get a payout? Usually quarterly, although some do pay semi annually. Payouts are usually credited directly to the bank if you have direct crediting with CDP.Instead of rushing into investments first, take time to study and consider your options. There are many asset classes out there, and you must also pay attention to the cons of each asset class, not just the pros. Only then can you judge which asset class is suitable. We all love a portfolio that grows, but when the storm comes, will you be able to weather it? Speak to an advisor if you must, for a good one can help distill the right information for you to make a choice. All the best!0 comments4"
