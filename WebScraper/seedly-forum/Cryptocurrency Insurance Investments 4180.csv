2,"Marcus GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 18 Jun 2018You might have heard scams and failure of cryptocurrencies. Around 95-99% of crypto fail because they only have a business idea but does not have partnerships, existing solutions to tackle the problem. ​I would recommend you to invest in the stock market first. Some passive and conservative investment could be ETF, Bonds and Defensive Stocks and understand that companies have valuation that can be valued compared to crypto. ​I'm not disencouraging you not to invest in cryptocurrencies, conversely encouraging you to do so to have some skin in the game as it is a new type of asset class to understand how the underlying technology, blockchain works and etc. ​Investing 1% of your net worth will be a good start and exposure to the cryptocurrencies as it is very volatile with no valuation. You could look up into the whitepaper to see who is supporting this projects and whether you think this crypto will be helpful to the world. ​There are many people also asking what types of crypto should I invest in? I found an answer that I think is suitable for all beginners. ​Buy the Top 5 crypto and diversify according as it has high trading volume which has high liquidity if you ever need to sell and also more conservative investment.
