Yes you should because the whole point of travel insurance is because we go travel , going different places and doing different activities and there are risk involve. Since we get protections while in our home land for our day to day activities, we should definitely get protections for activities such as ski and other sports while we're travelling to different country or places. ‚ÄãFor comparison and selection , use gobear or moneysmart especially moneysmart to check it out. For deals, go dig around between the insurance provider website or those 3rd party website to see who gives the best discount and deals for you.‚ÄãGet covered so you can have fun with the ease of mind!Have a good holidays! üòÉüëç0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018it really is up to you. would you feel better knowing that you can claim for injuries resulting from ski accidents? personally, i would not pay extra just to get an insurance that covers skiing. Reason is that I have negligible skiing experience, and therefore i would not attempt and high risk activities or slopes. this will make it such that i have a much lower probablity of getting a serious injury.it really depends on you and the risks you plan to take!0 comments1"

A quick check on MoneySmart's comparison platform for travel insurance shows quite a few insurers covering skiing (snow/ice sports), such as FWD & Etiqa. Nowadays travel insurance are highly affordable especially with promo codes and cashback. Purchase FWD for my 2 weeks trip to Taiwan and the medical claim process was both smooth and successful.

This is to prevent claims from being thrown back at you. For Japan, perhaps you can consider Sompo. I used that for my recent trip to Japan in June and did file a medical claim after I came back. Quite smooth process.0 comments0"
