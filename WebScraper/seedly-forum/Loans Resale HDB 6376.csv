question,"Loans Resale HDB Asked by AnonymousAsked 3w agoWhich home renovation loan should I take on?I am starting on my renovation soon, and am looking at banks’ loans interest rate. It looks like CIMB & Maybank are recommended by a lot of people, but I saw DBS’s interest rate is lower than the other 2 banks. Is there a particular reason why many will favour the former 2 banks?1 answerAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterAnswered 2w agoUsually, foreign banks give a higher loan limit than local banks (only in general, not for all cases) so people may face stricter or lower loan from local banks such as DBS.Also, banks give out promotions periodically, so it could be that CIMB and Maybank had much lower rates a few weeks/months ago and now the promotion rate has ended and DBS just launched theirs. =)Go for the best rate of the period you are loaning, it's the better info compared to reviews of the past.0 comments0"
