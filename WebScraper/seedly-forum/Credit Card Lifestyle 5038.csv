1,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 04 Dec 2018Haha it happens. Well, much like trying to kick any other habit, don't just stop immediately, take your time and set milestones to achieve, for example, buying a little less things, or only when you really require. For me it was designer toys! And oh boy can you imagine how many kinds of designer toys there are out there(they aren't cheap too!)But take a step at a time, and see if you can cut down on the purchases. Right now, I only buy the ones I really really like. Or better yet, the ones that I know will rise in value on the resale market in future. All the best! 0 comments2"
2,Tiffany SQLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 04 Dec 2018Agree that u can't immediately kick off the habit.. but look on the bright side.. at least u r aware of the problem ðŸ˜„ I had such exp before of spending too much in my poly days.. but what I did was.. I gave my mum all my credit cards/debit cards n learn how to live on budgeted cash.. until I learnt how to stop spending on uncessary things.. Or u can set a weekly target on how much u can spend weekly.. if u overspend this budget.. next week u will get lesser money until u learn how to control to buy what u need n not want which is the key of what u need to learn..0 comments1

Best to see / consult therapist, to find the actual root cause.  Once you find out the root cause, then you can really work on it to resolve it.Suggest to :Recognise the problems.  - You did! :)  Good Job! :) Be honest and acknowledge the issue. - You have! That's great too ! :) Find expert / seek help  -  Go find one :) With the solutions, keep on it till you're no longer in bondage.  - Gambate :) 0 comments1"
