1,Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Mar 2019Just read the article. Seems as though Motif wants to ride of the hype of tech innovations that can create proprietary barriers- as their selling point. Not sure whether they can thoroughly evaluate and accurately price these innovations purely based of patent fillings and academic papers. They are probably just leveraging off Goldman Sachs big reputation to establish demand for this ETF.0 comments1
