1,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 20 Sep 2019There's ACCA, and accountancy course from NTU, SMU and I would guess NUS by now... But to be sure, try researching from this link: https://isca.org.sg/become-a-member/pathways/chartered-accountant-pathway/Not all types of degrees can lead to exemptions or qualifications, at least find out, and take the necessary routes only to save $$ and time.Take internships with the Big Four, if possible, E&Y or KPMG. The toughest training usually gives you the most learning.Its a long way to be a CFO but education, and training will surely build up a good foundation.For a real life example, the CFO of Kraft Heinz was an investment banker, younger than me. Look at its share price trend in 2019. You probably don't want to be that guy.0 comments0"
