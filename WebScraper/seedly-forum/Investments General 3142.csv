1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Nov 2018I believe that if the internet shuts down, it will greatly affect the economy.Assets would cease to hold value, much less stocks. Much of our data is being stored on the internet, and much of our communication depends on it as well.The world as we know it will change, even if the internet comes backon after a period of time. We will most likely start to revert back to how things were before internet was available, with some rare few things that do not depend on the internet to remain usable.Investments wise, anything that is tracked online you can count it as gone, unless there is a local copy of it saved, and even so, not many people will know where to access it, or how to access itThe internet going down is quite a scary thought indeed, but I doubt something like that will happen in the near future!0 comments1"
