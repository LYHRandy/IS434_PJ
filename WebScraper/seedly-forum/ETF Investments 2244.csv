MasterAnswered on 13 Mar 2019ETNs (exchange-traded notes) are structured investment products issued by a major bank or provider as senior debt notes, different from ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that consists of an actual security. You can think of ETNs more like bonds as they are unsecured. When you purchase an ETN, you are buying a debt product. When you purchase an ETF you are purchasing an asset like a stock or index. Due to the nature of ETNs, ETN investors are exposed to credit risks. That is should the major bank or provider go bankrupt, investors do not have priority to claim the firm's assets.0 comments0"
