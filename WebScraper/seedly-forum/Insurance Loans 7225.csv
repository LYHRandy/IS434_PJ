5,Ablah KethuLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 05 Jul 2018Have a positive thought is good but it is quite unnatural that every review is only positive without any further mentions then it is considered as a negative work too. If these reviews you choose for buying or considering anything then my suggestion is to prefer other alternative reviews as well so that you can round up which reviews are genuine and worth reading.​0 comments0
