2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Oct 2018Can't speak for others but I do like to learn new stuff. Typically I attend a course on something new every year, be it related to work, investments or a new business idea for a sideline. I'd say it's good to keep yourself abreast on the changes in your industry. Hope this helps 0 comments0"
3,"Xinyi LumLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Oct 2018Yes! Wouldn't say I can speak for professionals, but almost 1 in 3 colleagues of mine attend classes or sessions after work that contribute to upgrading some form of skills and these classes are mostly not related to their work. I am also looking into learning a new skill!0 comments0"
4,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Oct 2018I know at least I like to learn new things, because it's interesting! ​Usually I'll see a sizable amount of people attending conference / talk about something new especially those of hot trend that seems to be able to make a lot of $ or show potential such as cryptocurrencies, which is full house for the reputable talk.​Otherwise in the same domain knowledge for work, it is still quite popular among all. Rather to be more precise, I think nobody wants to be outdate in the workforce or skills or lose out on something new that can make good $, so we're either forced or naturally drawn to anything that can help improve us. 0 comments0"
