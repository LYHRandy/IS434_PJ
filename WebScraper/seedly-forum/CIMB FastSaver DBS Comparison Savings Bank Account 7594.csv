IF CIMB became more convienient and time-efficient, I would use it. Otherwise, that $9500 is not exactly going to make a dent in terms of interest made yearly because you want it to be as liquid as possible (I'm going on this assumption safely). If you were truly interested in building interest with some conditions, with that kind of money you could probably open a DBS Multiplier account, or you could just..invest it, toss it in a proper savings plan, etc. Illiquid money/Commitment always breeds wealth, but if you want it liquid, convenience/time is money, not money. â€‹Please keep that in mind. 0 comments0"
