question,"Shopping Asked by Takingstock @Asked on 20 Aug 2019Where do you draw the line for organizations that ask for proceeds to help folks, but are not actual charities? ?Some of them sell stuff at ridiculous prices, and its very difficult to check them out. Its only when you read the fine print that they say they are not charities.Its very difficult to differentiate because they are doing a sale, but tell you some of the proceeds go to funding something. Because they are.not charities, they do not have the responsibility to explain how the proceeds are managed.So how do you know if you have been scammed?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 21 Aug 2019I draw the line very clearly - I don't support on them because there is just no way to verify that the proceeds are going to the causes you think it is going to, especially when they are approaching you on the street.I did speak to one of them once, and my take-away is that a minority of what you pay actually goes to the charity. Most of it goes to them as 'salary'.If you are looking to donate to a cause you feel passionate for, go directly.2 comments2"
2,T@Takingstock @21 Aug 2019Yes I think they earn quite a bit as commission fees. Just feel like its a rip off.Junus Eu21 Aug 2019I totally agree

Instead, go to the actual charity they say they are helping and make the donation there. They will appreciate the gesture more and skip the whole middleman thing.2 comments0"
4,"T@Takingstock @20 Aug 2019Ya. I guess where I am struggling is I am hard on my own budget already, and its impossible to help everyone. I guess my own issue is I need to set an annual budget for donations, and I would very much rather the $$ go to someone in difficulty.Aik Kai20 Aug 2019Yeah.. do what you think is the best. All the best!"
