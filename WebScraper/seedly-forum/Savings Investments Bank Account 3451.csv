1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Sep 2018Saving is easier than earning. It's the small things that we dont usually take notice of that counts. Take for example a cup of coffee at $5 a day. It'll amount to $35 per week, $150 per month and $1825 per year. In reality, there's many more 'lavish' choices we make and there are cheaper alternatives available. You can review through your lifestyle and make the necessary adjustments to save the money for your trips! 0 comments0"
