1,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Oct 2018The current market climate is not ideal for investing because of the increased market volatility. The trade war between US and China is not helping either. There are too much uncertainties in the markets. My humble opinion is not to take too much risks and that trading is a better option to deal with this problem. 0 comments0
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Oct 2018How do you invest for 3 years in a bull market and ended up with a negative returns? How and what are you investing in for the past 3 years? Bear market is the moment when some people will buy more to earn from the drop. People who DCA will also be happy about the drop. If you invest 3 years in the bull market and having a negative returns, you need to review your investments.0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 16 Oct 2018It'll help if you could let us know what you've been investing in and possibly why?At the end of the day, if your fundamentals was sound, and you have a long term horizon, you shouldn't be worried.In fact, it might make more sense to average down and invest more.And if course, if you were investing in the dark 3 years ago, you might wanna take a break and invest in education for awhile before getting back into the market. 0 comments0"
