1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The disadvantage is that u usually have to play a slightly worse off price compared to the ready market. But it really isnt a big deal. You could be just losing a few ticks on the odd lot portion. If u are going for scrip dividend, u should have the intention to hold/accumulate for the longer term. You wouldnt need to sell anyway.Board lot (usually 100, can be 10 or 50 for some) will be traded in the 'ready market'). Anything less, the odd lot trades in the 'unit share market'. It is less liquid so typically the spread will be wider. 1 comment1"
