God of WisdomAnswered on 28 Apr 2019It was my choice of Robo until EndowUs, MoneyOwl, and other IFAs who distribute Dimensional Fund Advisor's funds came around.FSM Maps uses Unit Trusts, but the same unit trusts you can DIY yourself in their own platform. But for a 0.5% advisory fee, you get portfolio and asset allocation, and rebalancing services. But the overall fund management charge on the funds they use are around 1.3% p.a.If you're a fan of active management, then this or the DFA options are your best options.0 comments0"
