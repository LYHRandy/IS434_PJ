2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 10 Sep 2019To buy into REITs, easiest way would be to go through a broker to purchase the REIT counter. Depending on your broker the shares may be deposited in your CDP account or held in a custodial account with your broker.StashAway just launched an SGD focused income portfolio with some exposure to REITs so that would be the closest to what a Robo advisory can help you with in this respect.Hope this helps2 comments0"
3,"MMelissa10 Sep 2019Hmm but Stashaway requires me to have a minimum of $10000 to start investing if Iâ€™m not wrong. What about if I purchase it thru a reit counter? What will be the minimum sum?Jonathan Chia Guangrong10 Sep 2019Reit counter, you will need to purchase in lots of 100 shares and final price depends on the reit price. For example mapletree logistics trust closed at $1.57 today. This means you need $157 to purchase 100 shares of this reit, before commission if you were to purchase tomorrow assuming the price stays the same. Hope this helps!"
