1,"Dominic ChangLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jun 2018Depends. You can look into BOC Family card. 10% on Dining, 5% on online shopping. However minimum spend is $700 so you will be putting everything onto your card expense.0 comments2"

Can you fulfil the other requirements of the various credit cards to enjoy the benefits they offer?​I personally use the DBS Altitude card. No minimum spending, and I get free airport lounge access. The miles also do not expire. It's good for my needs. You have to evaluate your needs :)0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jun 2018Before I converted to mileage earner, i was a cashback person.Based on the basic spending as follows, i also suggest BOC Family Card. ​Local Transportation - ATU NetFlash Pay of 5% is the best you can get because normally Ezlink top up doesn't earn you anything. You can up to 4 top up per month, that's $200.​Dining - 10% There are other card offers higher than this but considering that you just started working and expenses should be still low. Consolidate your spending in one card could be a better start.​Online Shopping - 5% (cap at $600) ​By the way, i strongly suggest that you take a look at the mcc codes in the following link. In this example, Seedly team is using BOC Family card to illustrate. https://blog.seedly.sg/mcc-codes-singapore-for-credit-cards/​0 comments1"

Which can give you a better saving interest if you use their CC.​There is a min spending though, so check if you are comfortable to spend that amount and can pay back monthly first.​Ignore me if the account you decided don't need CC spending0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 11 Sep 2018Try to look at having a total banking relationship than just the credit card alone. ​2nd step would be to Look at joining the  Cashback or miles camp. Focus spending is better than trying to achieve both.DBSUOB SCBbOCMaybank OCBC ​0 comments0"
6,"Chen QijianLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Sep 2018Are you a miles or CB person? Second what are you looking to get out of your saving accounts?​If you are fresh out of school => Assumption is that you earn close to 3k. In that case the best savings account (w relatively lax conditions) is DBS Multiplier.​In order to pair this off, just get the Altitude Card and the Live Fresh card. Use the Live Fresh for Paywave transactions and use the altitude card to get your miles.​Finally....cancel the cards the next year and get something else unless they waive that annual fee for you ;)0 comments0"

Note: cashback is capped at 60
http://www.frankbyocbc.com/products/cards/credit-card/Depending on the number of restrictions you're willing to handle and whether you are likely to hit the minimum spend, whether you'd go beyond the cashback cap etc, you can also try a more straightforward cashback card like SCB Unlimited.0 comments0"
9,"Sor Jiaming KelvinLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 10 Jun 2018Sound exactly like what my juniors asked me when they first started work. ​the cards that you're making reference too seems like different card type (Live Fresh and SCB unlimited should be cashback card while Altitude is surely a miles card). Perhaps you might want to consider taking a step back to see what type of cards suits your lifestyle more (points, cashback, miles).​Typically most fresh grad choose cashback card cause it just help with cashflow and savings but if you want to aim for a big holiday/honeymoon for example in 2-3 yrs time, then maybe a miles card might be more a possible option.  ​Also can i just double confirm that you already have a multipler account (assuming your fresh grad pay meets the min. to benefit from a multipler account). Because if you're using a multipler account yet, you totally should be considering it as it helps your finances from a broader perspective. Taking into account that to reap the benefit of a mulitpler account, you need to use the account's bank cards and the fact that you need to spend a min and assuming that you're not likely to spend much for a fresh grad, you're pretty much limited to the cards offered by the multipler account's bank. ​For example, if you're choosing a DBS multipler, you're now limited to either Live Fresh or Altitude and the others will then not be of concern. 0 comments0"
