1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Maybe this will help you better :) We actually knew Alvin and DrWealth since the start of Seedly about 3 years back. They were called BigFatPurse back then. Then over time, there was this investment app called DrWealth which helped you track your portfolio and returns. This was funded by an investor which they knew very well. Then they merged and now BFP which is now known as drwealth, mainly focuses on education and classes. Really good classes at that! Would recommend them to most people. They are not scammy, but instead, they offer you real education value and knowledge. A longer term approach to investing.​https://www.drwealth.com/about/​Let me pull out some excerpts:​""We want our company to blossom. We want to be the lotus in the financial education industry. We do not want to be associated with the get rich quick people. We only want to inculcate the real investment strategies that work for keen investors. We want to be remembered for being the most trusted financial educator,""​""Moreover, it wouldn't be easy to get good results investing our money because it is highly competitive, and it is impossible to avoid losses. We might even lose a lot of money if we made a wrong decision on a leveraged position. But most importantly, we must have the tenacity to pull through and learn from our mistakes.​Our graduates have grown over the years to over 3,000 to date. We know we can do better because we strongly believe that our investment approaches are closer to the truth than what others in the murky waters offer. We must work hard to promote the effective and systematic way of investing. ​At times, we receive encouragements and good results from our graduates. They agreed that we were different from the others and we genuinely cared about telling the truth about what works in investing, even though it would be hard to accept. They gain confidence in investing because they know they are well-equipped with objective and systematic investing ""2 comments2"
