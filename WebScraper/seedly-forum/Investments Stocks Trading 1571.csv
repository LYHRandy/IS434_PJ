MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Hi anon,Wouldn't say that I am an active trader but one macro indicator/event that really moves market is no doubt central banks' decisions on interest rates - be it the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting that happens in the US (They schedule eight meetings per year, one about every six weeks or so. The Committee may also hold unscheduled meetings as necessary to review economic and financial developments. The FOMC issues a policy statement following each regular meeting that summarizes the Committee's economic outlook and the policy decision at that meeting). or in Europe, where the European Central Bank usually meets every two weeks. Every six weeks, it takes its monetary policy decision, i.e. setting the key interest rates for the eurozone.Their view and decisions on interest rate policies is highly important as it gives a overall picture of the broader economy. For instance, ECB's commitment to maintain interest rate at 0% last month signals that most of Europe (even Germany) is facing deflationary growth. Also, decisions by the FOMC to raise(cut) interest rates will usually result in a decrease(increase) in share prices. Hence, this is highly important to help you enter/exit your position.0 comments0"
