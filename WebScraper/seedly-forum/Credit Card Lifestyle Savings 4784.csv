MasterAnswered on 21 Jun 2019Hi anon!Check out our new Seedly article on which credit cards to link to your SimplyGo account here: https://blog.seedly.sg/transitlink-simplygo-promotions/If you're looking into other credit cards instead of the OCBC 365, you should ask yourself what do you prioritize: cashback OR miles? For cashback, i would recommend DBS Live Fresh. For miles, i would recommend Maybank Horizon Visa Signature. Do read the T&Cs still to see if your expenditure behaviour matches the card's features!Hope i helped! Happy traveling :-)0 comments1"

Valid with minimum fares of S$30 from 6 June to 31 July 2019. Limited to the first 30,000 registrants"" If you spend $30 then it's definitely more worth it during this period, otherwise, outside of this promotion period, your transportation costs only contributes to your monthly expenditure to aid you to obtain a higher interest (min. $500 monthly spend = additional 0.3%) to your deposit accountQuestion Poster16 Jun 2019I see. Thanks for clearing my doubt. Just not too sure this promotion will ongoing after 31 July 2019."
