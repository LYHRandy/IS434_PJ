However, as with all questions that ask about ""best"", it's dependent on ""you"", along the lines of ""what's best for you"".  There's a couple of questions you need to answer: Q1) Do you have the X to DIY investing? (X = time, effort, determination etc etc).  If you have no time, unwilling to spend hours/days/weeks learning, always improving, then chances are that you should ""outsource"" your financial future (financial advisors, roboadvisors, fund managers etc)Q2) What kind of returns are you going for? If it's single-digit returns, then there's a lot of financial instruments that more-or-less guarantees it.  If it's triple-digit returns, then you probably have to try something that's a lot more risky.  If it's double-digit returns (say 15% per annum), then i think value-investing is probably the right choice. Q3) Do you have the emotional fortitude to stomach market downturns?   The very essence of value-investing requires that you go against the crowd.  Going with the crowd guarantees you market returns (personal favourite quote: Ordinary people must do extraordinary things to achieve extraordinary success).Q4) Do you believe in high risk / high reward and low risk / low reward?  If yes, then maybe you're not suitable for value-investing (sorry, this was a trick question).  The problem is that there're so many players out there in the financial markets who has a vested interest in convincing you a combination of the following:
(i) stock-picking requires ridiculous amounts of knowledge that only talented people like fund managers can do well; (ii) you can't beat the market(iii) to get high rewards, you need to take high riskThe reality is this: it's possible to get decent at value-investing (read: achieving 10% return p.a. in the long run) without talent, prodigious mathematical ability and ridiculous amounts of time.0 comments0"
