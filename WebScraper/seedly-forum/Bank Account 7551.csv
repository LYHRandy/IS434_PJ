1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Consider dbs multi currency account. You can convert from sgd to usd at anytime you wish. If you really need the usd account to be in another bank other than dbs, not much choices actually. FAST transfer will not work as it can only be done in sgd.. If the bank where your usd is in does not have a high commission charge for accepting physical deposits in USD, can consider changing at a money changer and deposit 2 comments0"
