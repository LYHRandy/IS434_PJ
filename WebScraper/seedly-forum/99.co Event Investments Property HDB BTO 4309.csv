WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi, Douglas here. 2nd Keynote speaker from the event.If you qualify, go for an EC as a new launch EC is priced at a discount to comparable mass market condos. A lot also depends on your life plans and lifestyle. There are not many new EC launches and you have to be ok with their locations and your budget must allow for it.
There’s one coming up at Sumang Walk, Punggol. Prob launching in June. And another at Canberra Link in late 2019 or 2020. Anchorvale Crescent, opposite Sengkang General Hospital and one at Tampines Ave 10 will be launched at a later date.If an EC is out of your consideration or budget, a BTO will do just fine.​​​
