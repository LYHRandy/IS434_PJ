ProdigyUpdated on 13 Jul 2019Currently the best credit card reward we know of for Grabpay topups is through the UOB One card, mainly because of the extra 5% cashback of ALL Grab transactions (including topup, Grab Food, Grab rides) that is given above and beyond the standard cashback tiers for UOB One card (up to 5%)We also wrote an article detailing how to maximise cashback on UOB One card through Grabpay topups that you may be interested to check out to learn how to get the maximum rewards on Grab0 comments0"

Miles wise I believe right now UOB Privi Miles is giving pretty good miles at $1 = 1.4 miles local spend.0 comments0"
