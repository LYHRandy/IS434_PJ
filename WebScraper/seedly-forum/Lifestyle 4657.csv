Grand MasterAnswered on 05 Sep 2019I don't have a scientific answer for this but my bet will go to nuts and seeds.Probably vegetables from the wet market such as broccoli probably contain more protein per $ than most meat.(it's quite a big myth that only meat, animal products are rich in protein)I am not a vegetarian but I am a fan of nuts, seeds, and fibre rich food.0 comments1"
2,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Sep 2019Can't claim to be expert, but my own perspective:consume everything in moderation. I think there was a report of a person who died from not consuming carbs for an extended period of time, and a NZ lady who didn't drink water at all but only coke.protein is good but really expensive. Carbs then to be the cheapest and make you full. Just to set expectations coz high protein meals will prob cost 2 to 3 times or more than a normal meal.personally I find milk and eggs cheap and good. Milk as liquid calories is also easier to consume. Tofu would be another cheap and good source. But if you are going for bodybuilding to look like an avenger, then protein from meats is probably better (for the body to build on).most importantly keeping fit is not just eat more protein over carbs. Just reduce eating junk food, reduce consumption of sugar, eat balanced meals and fruits/veggies, then try to consume fish/chicken more often than other meats - I think that will go a long way.Most of the time, it's not just building bulk. Reducing the excess fat tends to be the challenge, especially after you hit 30....0 comments0"
