1,"Charmaine Lim XiaomeiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 11 Oct 2018Hi Nicholas,​I'm not sure about other travel insurance but I got mine from Aviva for my last holiday. You might want to download and read their travel policy document here https://www.aviva.com.sg/en/insurance/travel/.​If I understand the policy correctly, you should be able to claim under 12a. Trip Cancellation for insured event 1 or 2 provided you meet the 'special conditions' highlighted in the screenshots below.You, Your spouse .... suffering from Serious Injury or Serious Illness, being Quarantined or dies.One of the following people suffering from life-threatening injury or illness, is Quarantined or dies .... All claims resulting from medical reasons, Quarantine or death must be supported by medical reports or a death certificate (or both) indicating the necessity to cancel Your Trip.In the worst case scenario, you can also claim under 12b. Trip Cancellation For Any Reason provided you purchase the travel insurance before or within 7 days from the date you made payment for your trip.​​​0 comments3"
