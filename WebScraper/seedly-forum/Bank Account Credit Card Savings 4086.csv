1,"Yinghua LiuLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 03 Jul 2019I have done a rough calculation on the interest for the savings account. Do note that I assume 2.5k on the DBS card as extra spending on the card would not result in higher interest in the DBS Multiplier unless you fulfil one more category (investment/ insurance/ home loan)Scenario 1
Account balance: 50k
DBS Credit card:2.5k per month
UOB credit card: 2k per month
Salary:7.5kInterest rate (DBS): 1.9% ($949 per year)
Annual Cashback (DBS): award in points and extra cost to convert to KrisFlyer miles
Interest rate (UOB): ~2% ($1015 per year)
Annual Cashback (UOB): $1200Scenario 2
Account balance: 60k
DBS Credit card:2.5k per month
UOB credit card: 2k per month
Salary: 7.5kInterest rate (DBS): 1.5% ($952.65)
Annual Points/miles (DBS): award in points and extra cost to convert to KrisFlyer miles
Interest rate (UOB): ~2% ($1245 per year)
Annual Cashback (UOB): $1200Based on the above and assuming 3miles for $1 spend & 1.8cents per miles, the miles from DBS card would be equivalent to be $135 to $270 estimated per month.
If you are able to spend the stated amounts for both DBS & UOB credit cards, UOB One would be a better choice for you. FYI: max amount to put in the UOB One account is 75k which will result in 2.4% but for DBS Multiplier, if you only fulfil one or two categories, max to put in the account would be 50k.0 comments1"
