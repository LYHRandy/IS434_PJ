question,"ETF Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 21 Mar 2019Investing into Irish-domiciled S&P 500 ETF?I am already vested in US-domiciled etfs (VTI, VGK, VPL, VWO) via Autowealth. I am now also looking into manually invest into Irish-domiciled etf to reduce the withholding tax from 30% to 15%. I am looking at the S&P 500 index, and some recommended the CSPX fund by iShares which is also an accumulating fund. Any other irish-domiciled etfs that tracked the S&P 500 worth considering?  In addition, any things to keep in mind when buying Irish-domiciled etf? many thanks :)4 answersAnswerBump1"

These 2 giants are the biggest and competing directly with each other for etf investors.Personally, I prefer all-world etf. US still a big portion of the world etf but in the case that US falls off, at least the etf would balance into other countries.0 comments1"

On some things to note.What i understand is that the Ireland domiciled ETFs closely replicate the Similar composition of the US ETF, so in that sense it’s the same thing but with:lower transaction volume (bid ask spreads)sightly higher expense ratiosBut your witholding tax on your dividends are at 15% instead of the normal 30% tax if you were to directly buy a US domiciled ETF.Personally, i’ve not done this but based on extensive research this is what I’ve found!0 comments0"
