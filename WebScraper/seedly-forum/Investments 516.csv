1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 16 Sep 2019Versus what ETFs? If you're comparing First State Bridge or Schroder Asian Growth fund, you'll have to find an Asia Equity Index and then an ETF to compare it against.An example would be the db x-trackers MSCI Pacific Ex Japan Index UCITS ETF (J0Q) that tracks the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Ex Japan TRN Index. The 10yr annualised on this index is 6.45% while the 10yr annualised on SAG is 9.8%.Also, the ETF would perform lower than the index because you still have to pay the ETF fee. The 9.8% declared from SAG is after the fund management fee.Plus, the fee for this ETF is at 0.65% p.a which isn't as cheap as the single-digit basis point ETFs tracking the large cap US markets.I'd much rather pay a little bit more for a fund manager to navigate the markets of an entire region especially when it isn't as efficient as the US market. Fund managers can still do considerably better than the index they track.1 comment4"
2,"Harvey Tan16 Sep 2019Paying high fees for an active fund only offer an investor the probability of achieving alpha, not actual alpha. And the said ETF (J0Q) has a TER of 0.45% pa, not 0.65% pa. There are cheaper ETF in the market that has similar exposure, perhaps 3010.HK (28bp) is a better choice? ( https://etf.dws.com/SGP/ENG/ProductOverview ) Furthermore, as the APAC market become more efficient over time, what makes you think that the fund manager can continue to generate alpha? Even assuming a normal distribution for fundâ€™s return, there bound to be outlier on both tails. Lastly, you should not be comparing the TER of an APAC market ETF to that of the US. Not exactly apple to apple comparison. The APAC market is not as efficient as the US market and hence this drives up the trading cost and in turn the TER."
3,"David ChangLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 17 Sep 2019Sure. But are the returns for Asian mutual funds good as a whole compared to their US and European counterparts? Was told that First State and Schroder can serve well for beginners in funds investment. On the other hand, ETFs will have to be traded by investors themselves with some level of market exposure. How true is that?0 comments0"
