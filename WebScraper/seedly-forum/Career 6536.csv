question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Jan 2019Should I quit my first job when I had just finished my appraisal for the probation period?This is my first job as a fresh uni undergraduate. My probation ends this month and I had just went through the appraisal process; however, I have received an interview offer by an even better company with better job prospects. I'm conflicted now as I'm just settling in this company with decent colleagues. Work has been rather easy and filled with menial tasks, and I am bored at work (not challenged). Will making a switch hurt my resume or future prospects? Thanks in advance for any advice :)5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Yk LaiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jan 2019I am not sure about other people. From my working experience in total 3 companies including the current one, 2 are MNC and leaders in the industry, I would only care whether my supervisor is a good leader as long as the company is not notorious of its welfare. The company could the best company, but does not directly make you the best employee unless your supervisor is good. So, if the current company is ok, you have a good supervisor, I think staying to gain more experience is not a bad idea. Otherwise, move.0 comments1"

3,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Jan 2019I would say take the job. Based on what you mentioned there is better pay and prospects. Sincec You are only one month in it wouldnâ€™t hurt your future job prospects unless you perform terribly or did some major screw up. 0 comments0"

5,"See all 3 comments Gabriel Tham10 Jan 2019he mentioned not challenged at work. Can just say looking for a more challenging role to develop and grow skillsets....Loh Tat Tian11 Jan 2019Then if the role is meant to conform, then dangerous if he quit now. Probably have to see how to work around a better answer. "
