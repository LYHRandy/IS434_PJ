1,"CPF BoardLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Aug 2019Hi Nathan,As there are currently no provisions to make top-ups solely to the Ordinary Account (OA), you can consider making voluntary contributions (VC) to your three CPF accounts (non-tax deductible). The VC amount will be allocated to the Ordinary, Special and MediSave Accounts according to the CPF allocation rates (https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employers/employerguides/employer-guides/paying-cpf-contributions/cpf-contribution-and-allocation-rates#Item588) for your age group.VC can be made via e-Cashier, AXS machine or cheque payment.
For more information on VC, please visit https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/FAQ/schemes/other-matters/cpf-contribution-for-employees.Alternatively, you can top up your own CPF Special Account (or Retirement Account if you are 55 years old and above) if you have the available topping up limit.Please follow these steps to check if you have the available topping up limit:Log in to my cpf Online Services at www.cpf.gov.sg with your SingPassClick on 'My Messages'Under “Retirement”, refer to “Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme”To find out more about the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme, please visithttps://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/retirement/retirement-sum-topping-up-scheme.0 comments6"

God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Jul 2019Top ups to CPF via cash can be done via AXS machine or even online. As the others have mentioned, you cannot target OA directly. So you either contribute $300 to all your 3 accounts, or you work backwards to see how much contribution is needed to have $300 deposited into your OA. As an example, if you are below 35, a $485 contribution will result in $300 being allocated to your OA.If you are topping up for the purposes of retirement/tax savings, the retirement sum topping up scheme might suit you better, since voluntary contributions in excess of your compulsory contributions do not give you any tax relief.0 comments6"

To secure the interest at 2.5% or 3.5% (if you have less than 20k), and use it for home purchase? If you intend to use it for retirement, then I would suggest doing a cash top up to SA instead. That way, you can maximize interest at 4% or 5% (up to $60k depending how much you have in OA). That way you get tax rebate as well which is great to have (because why not?). Only downside is that amount gets locked till you are 55/65 depending if you have hit basic retirement sum. Anyway my point is the reason for you putting money in OA will provide direction and further recommendation on what you should do with the $300.0 comments4"

ProdigyUpdated on 06 Jul 2019Hi as far as I know, its not possible to just top up OA.When you make voluntary contributions to CPF using CASH you can only choose either to contribute to ALL 3 accounts OR MA OR SA ONLY.Link below lets you calculate the ratio if you choose to top up all 3 accounts.
