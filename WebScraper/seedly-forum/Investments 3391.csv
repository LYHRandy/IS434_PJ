MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Never use the system before but did some homework after seeing this post.​you can refer to this link for a full read up.​https://www.etoro.com/trading/copytrader/how-it-works/​TL;DR​The only sensible copy trade will be the ""Copying only new trades"" and NOT ""Copying all trades""​From what I read, it seems the account holder is in full control but in actual fact all the open position are according to the account holder choice but might not be the price which are affected by real time market even when the choice is ""Copying only new trades""​Tbh, if the system is full proof in making money, even fund managers will ""invest"" with them but if the system is the usual market pratice of making money due with due diligent, then is safer to focus on market with fundamental support rather then copying someone u never met with a ""track record"".0 comments0"
