question,Investments Stocks Discussion Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 May 2019(Stock Discussion) CapitaMall Trust (SGX: C38U) and Frasers Centrepoint Trust (SGX: J69U)?I’ve been monitoring these two stocks for some time and contemplating whether to get this over which to buy. I’ve done all the backtesting but still feel both have their pros and cons. Should I just split the capital and invest in both instead?1 answerAnswerBump0

RookieAnswered on 04 Jun 2019FCT seems to have a more consistent DPU history, while CMT had a slight dip during the GFC.But keep in mind that past successes are not indicative of future successes. FCT's current CEO will retire on 1 July. How the incoming CEO will preform is anyone's guess! https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/frasers-centrepoint-trusts-manager-names-richard-ng-as-ceo-designate0 comments0"
