WizardAnswered on 11 Apr 2019If you intend to purchase monthly then Roboadvisor would seem to be the better option because it will lower your overall fees and expenses.Else, you can consider to collect 300/month and then buy stocks with the saved up amount.300/month to buy individual stocks each month will end up with you giving away too much in fees.0 comments0"
