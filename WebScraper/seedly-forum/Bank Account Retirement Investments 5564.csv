question,"Bank Account Retirement Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Dec 2018Questions on POSB invest saverI have invested in Nikko STI ETF and ABF Singapore index fund via POSB invest saver (RSP) at a fixed amount ratio of 2:1.

WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Read this: https://www.drwealth.com/lsi-vs-dca/So when the price goes downwards, then it's good to do DCA.If the price goes up trend, best to buy at low.However, we don't really know when it goes up or down till it happens, so if there'slimited we have, try to do DCA.One more thing, suggest don't put all your bonus in ETF.

4,Question Poster04 Dec 2018Thank you very much for your advice. Will continue to do so by increasing the standing order on a consistent basis than to do a lump sum
