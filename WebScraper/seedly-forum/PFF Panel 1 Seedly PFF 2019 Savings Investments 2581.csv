1,"Justin Kieran OngLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Since you just finished your A levels(18-20yrs) , I would suggest that you invest in yourself first. Get new skills, knowledge, experiences, etc. Those will help you in the long term.Once you have gotten a job and have a more solid capital/inflow of capital, then would be a good time to invest.0 comments1"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 01 Mar 2019Yes. I fully agree with Justin. I would say your best choice is Invest in knowledge. If I could go back a few years, I would have fully utilised the time I had post As to learn more- be it developing hard skillsets like coding or reading more books on finance and investing.Alternatively, pre-army i would recommend pick up a good part time job that pays decently well(8/hour?)Army after BMT and SCS/OCS will be your best friend. Better still if you are pes C or E. Use that time wisely. When you are ready, you would accumulated a sizable sum of savings(part time job + first few years in army) to make signifcant enough of a portfolio. Without the capital or knowledge, one without the other would be pointless.Besides. There aint nothing better staying up for guard duty and being able to monitor US markets at the same time.0 comments0"
3,"JeanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hello!Congrats on clearing your A levels :) With only $500 in savings, it might be a challenge to sustain your investments. There are some considerations you have to take into account for before you starting your investment journey. Firstly, set aside an emergency fund (6 months worth of your fixed expenses) because cash is king. You wouldn’t want to be in a position where you can’t fund for any unexpected emergencies. Secondly, I assume you will be going to university in July/August and based on personal experience, if you’re joining camps/activities/hall etc, there will be quite a few expenses here and there. So you have to consider your future liabilities as well.  If the above doesn’t apply to you and you have regular cash inflow, you can start investing in Singapore Savings bond, STI ETFs (you can apply for this through your bank) and endowment plans. Hope this helps! :)0 comments0"
