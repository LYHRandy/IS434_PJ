1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 05 Mar 2019""Enough"" is subjective, as I mentioned during my talk. You have to decide what makes you comfortable / able to sleep at night. If having 6 months worth of expenses stashed away makes you able to sleep well, then go for that. If you're still worried, then go for a longer period / larger amount. It's up to you!Start reading (free method, but need time and effort) or shortcut your learning journey by attending courses to learn how to invest. My advice is to go only for the courses that are under $2,000, because I'm personally not convinced of the value for those who charge higher than that cos I've seen their notes / have heard from those who paid and regretted it.0 comments1"
2,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019First find out which investment method suits your risk appetite. There are robo advisors, SSBs, CPF, ETFs, stock picking and a lot more ways to grow your money. Understand the advantage and disadvantage with each method and go for the one you are the most comfortable with or prefer. If you feel that 3-6 months of emergency funds makes you feel worried or uncomfortable, you can increase your emergency funds. It is important to have an emergency fund that makes you feel safe so that if anything happen when you invest or emergency, you know you have money to handle it.0 comments1"
