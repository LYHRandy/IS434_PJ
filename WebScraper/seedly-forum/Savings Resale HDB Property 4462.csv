1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It really depends what value u derive from this property. Only u can weigh how much the location is worth to u. Eg. some choose the location because it is close to parents, or work place etc. What would be the alternatives u are comparing against? BTO, private condo? 1 comment0"
2,"Question Poster07 Nov 2018Thanks for your reply. Mainly due to work place, but still close enough to parents (unable to get the 20k grant thou). Considered condo before, but we don't have much cash on hand hence unable to fork out the down payment for condo. "
