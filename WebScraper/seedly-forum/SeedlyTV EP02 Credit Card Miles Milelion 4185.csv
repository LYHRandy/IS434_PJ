question,"SeedlyTV EP02 Credit Card Miles Milelion Asked by Jacinda SiewAsked on 06 Apr 2019How to use miles when budget fares are just too good?I keep on accumulating my spend on a miles credit card, have close to 200k worth of Krisflyer miles, but haven't even redeemed a single mile since 4 years ago when I started this. The promo fares with budget airlines are just too attractive, I haven't actually flown a full class fare on a full service airline for a while now. How should I deal with this? Keep on accumulating miles?1 answerAnswerBump3"

ProdigyAnswered on 08 Apr 2019If you're looking to travel mostly within the region and you don't mind flying budget, then miles may not actually be right for you. You'd be better off with a cashback card which let you earn money towards paying for those budget flights. Miles tend to be more useful on long haul, premium cabin redemptions- with your 200K miles, you could easily redeem a round trip business class flight to the USA.0 comments4"
