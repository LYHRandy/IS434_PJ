1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 24 May 2019Definitely not weird. In fact many of HNW individuals I know do this. Itâ€™s a great gift imo! In singapore, you have to fill up a form to execute this act. 
For foreign countries, its best to consult the relevant parties or a lawyer there.0 comments3"

The person you are buying it for might not be savvy in investing and that could be a great gift in the future when the person really needs the money. Take note that there is a fee for transferring the stock to another person in CDP0 comments0"
