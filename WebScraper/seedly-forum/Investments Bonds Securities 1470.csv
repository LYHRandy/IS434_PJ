MasterAnswered on 29 Apr 2019FPLSP 3.95 PERP is a corporate bond, meaning you need to purchase $250k minimum worth of this bond. https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/bonds/factsheet/AP1551658/FPLSP-3-950-Perpetual-Corp-SGDAt this moment, this bond is trading below issue price, which equates to a higher Yield to Maturity (YTM). In a rising interest rates environment, bond prices might suffer further, do your due d and make sure that cash flows are able to sustain the payouts (don't let it be a repeat of Hyflux where cash was diminishing) Make sure they aren't using debt to repay debt also0 comments0"
