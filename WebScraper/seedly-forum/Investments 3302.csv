2,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 01 Oct 2018Have shared my review also on the reviews page here! https://seedly.sg/reviews/p2p-lending/funding-societies​Pros: Opened up my world of P2P investing which I never knew much about Relatively clear website with easy to understand visuals and areas Seems like a pretty rigourous KYC (know your customer) process to screen the loans and users Auto invest setting seems interesting (but has not yet worked for me yet) ​Cons: The whole onboarding process took really long like almost 4 days long Had documents to eSign and send to them to be verified Biggest con was the lack of deals and loans available to users ​Will update as I continue to use this product to share on the returns and defaults especially :)0 comments0"

Among all, Funding Societies has the best track record thus far, lowest default rate. After all, P2P is pretty risky since there's a risk of default. But always do your due diligence and diversity your investments by investing into multiple loans so that should one borrower default, you won't lose all of your capital. Otherwise, it offers attractive returns0 comments0"
