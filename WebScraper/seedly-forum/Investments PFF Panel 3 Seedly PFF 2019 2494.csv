I personally think that most people would invest in stocks or bonds etc, in order to diversify your portfolio you can also consider investing in commodities such as oil. It is also important to keep building your portfolio and regularly add to your investment. In order to have a diversified portfolio, lump sum investing is important, where you invest a sum of money into certain areas. By doing more lump sum investment it is highely likely that you will be able to diversify your portfolio since you will likely be engaging in different kinds of investments. Hope this helps!0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Mar 2019You diversify to try and eliminate or mitigate risk.A few of them include concentration risk, reinvestment risk, fx risk, and many more.So the ways to do that is by investing across asset classes, geographies, and industries.You wouldn't want to be too heavy into equity, nor just concentrated in the SG equity market, or all in tech stocks.I use funds to provide me with global diversification. And I also make sure that I have my bond allocation % follow my age. So since I'm 25, I have a 75% equity, 25% bond portfolio.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 04 Mar 2019Hi Anon, if you only are currently holding individual stocks, it is a good idea to invest some amount of money into the market index ETF of the current market you are invested in. A traditional one will be US S&P 500 of course. So your market index ETF will help you spread some risk of your individual stocks you are invested in currently and help preserve your capital in events of bad performance by these stocks.Eventually, think about rotating your investments into fixed income instruments as well  if you are looking to invest for your retirement -- Investment grade bonds of emerging economies like India give good coupon rates while still relatively being default risk free.In essence --Don't put all your eggs in one basket. buy the whole market to diversify fully, if not, buy the ETF together with your chosen stocks to help you cover some risk at least. Bonds are good ways to protect your capital and a good idea to park your money in your later years, think about rotating money into that as you grow older.0 comments0"
