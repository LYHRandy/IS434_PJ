1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Personally, I prefer Youtrip for the competitive rates.I just used Youtrip on my Japan trip, and found rates to be comparable to what I could get from the Raffles Place money changers.Another big plus - when I was out of JPY for a transaction, it converted my SGD to JPY. Which also means, no small change that I need to change back to SGD when I get back! For me, that's a nice plus since I typically don't like to change it back to local currency.I don't mind using it as a one-way wallet, because I use Youtrip as an EZ-Link card as well for my local commute!Get S$10 free money after your first top up on Youtrip with this link! https://youtrip.app.link/HUI%20JUN128899** **Update June 2019: 9 more available! 0 comments1"
