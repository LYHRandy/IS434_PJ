New versions are often replaced by another brand-new version within the next few months and the price of the ""new version"" you've just bought drops significantly.It is just a hype and not worth the extra money! :[ (cue to overpriced Apple product...)Hope the above helps a little! :)2 comments2"
2,"Mujimoro28 Jun 2019Yep - I agree. I’ve decided I’m not going to upgrade my iPhone X this year. The rumours suggest iPhone 11 looks underwhelming. My phone is still good enough!Jennifer Goh28 Jun 2019I totally agree! and tbh the Iphone models are virtually identical when you do a side by side comparison (ok...maybe the the latest model is 0.1mm thinner -.-)

PS. Thanks for the upvote! :)"

I regret forcing myself to study just for the sake of it and not truly learning & discovering what I enjoy. Wasted lots of money on tuition when the real issue was the mindset towards studies, anyone feel me haha0 comments0"
