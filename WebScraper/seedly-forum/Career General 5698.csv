If people have to travel 20 mins to buy food in China then it makes more sense to order delivery In Singapore you can mostly likely walk downstairs to the hawker center or coffee shop for food and be back home in 15 mins0 comments1"

FreshieAnswered on 07 May 2019Not limited to China, but I’ve used Grab and GOJEK food in Indonesia and it’s a booming chunk of their business, mainly as the fees involved are low and the workforce affordable. In Singapore, not only are the menu items inflated (about 1.2-2x), we have additional surcharges for takeaway packaging, low order fees etc for ala carte orders. It’s no wonder singaporeans would rather drive/walk to get their chow.0 comments0"
