1,"Javier Lim, Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 28 Jul 2019There’s no best credit card, just the ones that are best suited to your lifestyle. For most people, a Cashback card like UOB One fits the bill for most things. Maybe you can use a tool like moneysmart to compare what’s best for you.1 comment4"
2,"SKStacy Kuah28 Jul 2019Probably I could have further elaborate on my question. What I meant was the type of card best in the market, somewhat mentioned by Mark below. 

Of cos I do take a look at moneysmart but I would also like to hear more suggestions from people in seedly.

It’s always best to seek for second opinions."

Earn rebatesFor clothes, shoes and online spend except travel: Citi Rewards Card. Earn points (miles)For travel and everything else: DBS Altitude Card. Earn points (miles)But of course there are some better earning miles card out there, with shorter miles expiry date and some complicated criteria.1 comment2"
