1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 16 Mar 2019Why investWhen Japanese investors invest in bonds overseas (e.g US), they'll apply currency hedging (to reduce foreign exchange risk). As a result, there will be additional premium for investing. The rising hedging cost renders it unviable to invest in US bonds since net returns would be higher when investing locally.Why the low yieldThis results in Japanese investors to pull their money back to domestic markets. When demand increases, price of bond will increase and bond yield will decrease.0 comments0"
