1,"SShieleenLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 29 Jun 2019Go seek professional help from career advisor / career coach. There are so many schemes available (https://www.ssg-wsg.gov.sg/programmes-and-initiatives.html) to help local workers. But first, that person must be willing to be assisted and help himself to get out of current situation since there might be more (to the described above) than meet the eyes. Be open minded, receptive to suggestions and adapt to changes. Don’t get stuck in the past, don’t externalize problems, make it work gradually.Nobody owes anyone a living and there’s no shortcut to success. So if need be, upgrade / take action to change current situation! Employers hire for relevant skills & positive attitude, that’s what they value. On the other hand, nothing is wrong with husband taking on the role of caring for family.0 comments2"
2,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 29 Jun 2019Like Shieleen said, nobody owes anybody anything. Times have changed and robots / computer programs will take over more and more jobs. The accountant wife is not immune to job loss, and if that happens, what do they do?If you have the will, you will find a way. Besides 35-40 is still young. The hdb finish paying off already? Retirement saved already?With the speed the world is changing, constant retraining required to keep up.I know... coz I know wat is instagram and snapchat, but I ain't using either too. Its just a small slip, doesnt mean have to drop out of the race. But a change of pace could bring about a different scenary and experiences. Maybe something good may come out of it.0 comments0"
