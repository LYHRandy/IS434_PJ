1,"Cherie Julianne TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jul 2018Check your coverage: Check if your policy has a global coverage or at least covers you in the country you are intending to move abroad to. If I'm not wrong, most insurers in Singapore does provided worldwide coverage (with some countries as exclusions).If you are covered, that's great!​Update your insurer:If you intend to stay abroad, update your agent or the insurance company with your new overseas residential address.​To make a claim:Correct me if I am wrong, I believe not all regional offices are able to process your claim. They might not even know the existence of your policy. Simply put, only submit your claim to the insurer's Singapore's office. They should be able to send you a cheque to your overseas residential address. ​Have fun abroad!Don't lose your policy contract too!0 comments2"
