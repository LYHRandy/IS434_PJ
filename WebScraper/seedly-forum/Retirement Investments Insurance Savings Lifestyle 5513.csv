God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Start by setting aside 6 months of your expenses for emergencies.After that, invest 20-50% of your income.Break down your short term, mid term, and long term goals and quantify them. A marriage, a first home, children, children education, a second home, retirement, etc. How much would these cost you and when do you have to start paying for them.Start understanding our CPF and how each accounts work as well. When you have a clearer roadmap, you can make better decisions to get there.0 comments1"
