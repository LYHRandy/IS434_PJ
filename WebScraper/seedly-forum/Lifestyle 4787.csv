2,Sim Min XuanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 21 Jun 2019I currently subscribe to netflix as it is much more convenient than buying/renting. i purchased a plan and split it with 5 other people so it is affordable at around $2-3 per month? however i would advise you to not subscribe to netflix if you realized that you arenâ€™t going to be using it often. even a recurring bill of $2/month adds up to $24/yr. but i think this will be okay for you as you stated that watching movies is your favourite pastime!0 comments1

The shared cost will be cheaper than single subscription.Not really into buying because then you have to store the physical copies. Renting is also not cost effective. A subscription service works best, there are Hulu, Netflix, upcoming disney plus, HBO, etc. Really depends which network the the shows you want.0 comments0"
