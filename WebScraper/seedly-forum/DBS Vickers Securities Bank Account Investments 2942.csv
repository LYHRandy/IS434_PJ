1,"Charmaine Lim XiaomeiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi there! Not sure if this answers your question.​When I opened my DBS Vikers, it came with a DBS multi-currency account. To use the cash upfront option in Vikers, simply top up your multi-currency account and the buy limit of your Vikers will increase accordingly.1 comment4"

ProdigyAnswered on 15 Jul 2018Extracted from: https://www.dbs.com.sg/vickers/en/resources/faq/cash-upfront-account Log in to your DBS/POSB iBanking account, mouse over the “Invest” tab, click on “More Investment Services” and select “Top Up Cash to DBS Vickers Account”. You may transfer funds from your DBS Savings Plus/S$ Current/Autosave, POSB Savings/Current accounts or Cashline account to your DBS Vickers Cash Upfront Account.Note: This service is available from 8.00AM to 11.30PM (indicative) on working days Monday to Friday. On the last working day of the month, this service is available from 8.00AM to 8.30PM (indicative).​I think you may have to give DBS a call to change the settlement arrangement.0 comments1"
