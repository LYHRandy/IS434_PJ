1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 30 Jul 2019Funds will be returned to the bank that you opened your CPF investment account with. It will be a local bank. The bank will hold it for a period of time (3-4 weeks) before transferring it to CPF. Hence if you need the liquidated funds to be moved to CPF fast, you need to give specific instruction to them to move it.3 comments10"
2,"See all 3 comments Eric Chia18 Jun 2019To add on, there are 3 local banks that your account can be with - DBS, UOB or OCBC. And you can call the respective bank to transfer the money back to CPF after it's returned to the bank to accelerate the process. OCBC ATM also serves the same function!Mango Lin30 Jul 2019Thank You!"
