God of WisdomAnswered on 24 Aug 2019I view Aviva's group insurance as an add on in term of coverage. Premiums are cheap till 65 for the death/TPD portion of coverage, as well as for personal accident. However, the maximum cover is $1 million, which may not be adequate depending on your individual circumstances, and you are not the policy owner, which means that you can lose your coverage in the unlikely event that this scheme ceases.Ensure that you have your own personal coverage before consider such add ons to complement your cover. For example, you wouldn't want to rely on your company's medical/hospitalization coverage as you could change your job or retire someday, and with that, you would lose your coverage.0 comments3"

ProdigyAnswered on 23 Aug 2019Hi there, for 20-year term plans to cover for life and TPD (example to cover for mortgage loans), a personal term plan can be even cheaper. Depends on what are your key concerns.To the age of 65, the Group term life premium is cheap. Similarly for the personal accident coverage.On the other hand, the critical illness (living care) is not competitive and the early critical illness rider (living care plus) has limitations. I've got a full write-up on it over here:https://www.theastuteparent.com/2017/06/saf-group-term-life/

MasterAnswered on 22 Aug 2019https://blog.seedly.sg/should-you-cancel-your-aviva-mindefmha-group-insurance-after-you-ord/  for your reference.I view it as an add-on for my Death/TPD benefit after age 30 because the premiums are attractive (up till 65 age).For CI protection, if you are past 30, it might be more worth to get a Private Term plan.0 comments0"
