1,"Pascal SamsoonLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 16 May 2018I would recommend going for a combination of REITs and STI ETF ​The former requires you to, study and understand how REIT works (Start here)always have spare cash in your SRScontinuously review and rebalance your portfolio of REITsThe latter requires to, buy frequently, preferably bi-annually (like on your birthday and on the day that you are topping up your SRS account)do nothing elseYou can may use one of the online brokerages (See Reviews) which support SRS cash to purchase stocks​Hope it helps​Pascal0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 16 May 2018Just for some context: The SRS is part of the Singapore government’s multi-pronged strategy to address the financial needs of a greying population by helping Singaporeans to save more for their old age. It began in 2001 and is operated by the private sector. The SRS complements the Central Provident Fund (CPF). CPF savings are meant to provide for housing and medical needs and for basic living needs after retirement. Unlike the CPF scheme, participation in SRS is voluntary. SRS members can contribute a varying amount to SRS (subject to a cap) at their own discretion. The contributions may be used to purchase various investment instruments.0 comments2"

God of WisdomAnswered on 16 May 2018Hi Anon,​The easiest fuss free options when utilising SRS monies would be to purchase annuities or endowment plans if your goal is capital preservation. There is currently a pretty good option from TokioMarine. ​If you're looking for growth, you should invest in a Globally Diversified Managed Portfolio through a Financial Advisor. He/She will be able to provide you with a suitable portfolio in relation to your risk profile. Charges would include Sales Charge, Wrap Fee, and Platform Fee for iFast or Navigator platforms.​The 2nd option would allow you to incur lesser fees if you need to terminate early and withdraw your SRS monies for whatever reason.​Note* There is a limitation in the funds your SRS monies can be invested in, similar to CPF OA options. 0 comments1"
