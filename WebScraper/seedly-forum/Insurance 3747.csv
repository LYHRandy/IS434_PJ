God of WisdomUpdated on 09 Jul 2019It's good that you are reaching your savings goal for your emergency funds, as that forms your last line of defence in a situation where you need immediate liquidity.To get started, you can speak to an independent financial advisor like myself to understand what kinds of insurance you will need at this stage in life, and we can help you to compare across multiple insurers to get you the most cost effective plan.I would say that these are the insurance you need to consider:1) Hospitalization plan - for hospital expenses2) Critical illness coverage - rule of thumb is usually 5 times your income, or a baseline for alternative treatment plus five years of expenses3) Death cover - Ten times your annual income or based on your existing liabilities (e.g. are you supporting your parents?) If you have no liabilities then this is not strictly necessary.4) Personal accident - for all the unexpected happenings5) Disability insurance - A nice to have, this is for income replacement in the event you are unable to perform your current jobFollow the guidelines and rule of thumb and you should not be spending more than 10% of your income to cover yourself adequately.

2,"Joke Jong09 Jul 2019Why do we need 10x our income for death in comparison to 5x for critical illness coverage? Shouldn’t critical Illness have more weightage so that we don’t become a burden to society and others in the family?Elijah Lee09 Jul 2019If you are suffering from a critical illness, there is still a chance that you can recover fully and return to being economically active.

Whereas if you are no longer around due to death or totally unable to work due to permanent disability, your income stream completely ceases to exist."
