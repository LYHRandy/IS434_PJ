Getting married and getting a BTO? Or renting? Either will present different challenges in cash flow​Retirement. How much do you know about investing? You do have a long horizon ahead of you for retirement. Can do some reading to know about the different types of financial instruments that can get you towards retirement. Talk to older friends who are preparing for retirement and get some ideas. Set aside funds each month for savings and towards investments. It's getting easier these days to start investing, but you need to be sure you are investing in the right ones.​Do check with us if you need more help, and all the best0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 17 Sep 2018Yes, without knowing your salary, expenses allocations, target housing and retirment horizon, we're not able to suggest much .You'll need to know your target so that you can work towards it. Without a target, you'll be shooting the sky randomly. We don't plan to fail, we only fail to plan. ​However, I suggest that you can follow this as a good guide to start the planning : 5/3/2 https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-allocate-your-monthly-salary/​Figure out your tlrget : What house you wanna buy, how much is needed (cash and CPF, reno cost etc). Next , with the above links, try to do  a simple excel with some assumptions to get a projections of possible outcome and work backwards on how much you need to save / invest in order to reach your target. ​As always, we're here to help. just ask :) ​Happy Life planning ! :) 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 19 Jul 2018it's quite difficult to provide proper feedback as there is not much details on how much u earn etc.But rule of thumb is to set aside about 10% for insurance and AT LEAST 20% of your take home as savings for retirement.As for your housing, there is CPF.0 comments0"
