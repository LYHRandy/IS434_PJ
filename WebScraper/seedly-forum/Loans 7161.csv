WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You can get a loan, but it is not favourable to you as you are a foreigner, and have no assets to tie you down to your loan should you not repay it.You will most likely need to pledge a sum of money to the bank as fixed deposit before the bank will offer you any sort of loan.5 comments1"
