God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi anon,Just reach out to us and have a word with one of us first, to find out more. Find an advisor you can click with. Do note that independent financial advisors won't be able to do GE or Prudential. After speaking with us, choose someone you are comfortable to work with and are also comfortable to provide private details to. He or she will need the details you give to plan properly for you, regardless of what the issue may be.0 comments4"

God of WisdomUpdated 2w agoHey Anon!There are quite a few IFAs here on the Seedly QnA but if you'd like to look at an unbiased comparison, MOH has already done one.https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/integrated-shield-plans-documents/april-2019/comparison-of-pvt-hosp-ips-(1-april-2019)-v2.pdf(https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/integrated-shield-plans-documents/april-2019/comparison-of-pvt-hosp-ips-(1-april-2019%29-v2.pdf)Usually for seniors, however, I'd tend to recommend NTUC Income Shield or Raffles Shield due to premiums and underwriting. :)0 comments1"
