question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Jul 2018What should I start investing in when living in Australia?Hello everyone! I migrated to Australia late last year and I've been saving up to apply for a PR here which costs a lot of money. I was wondering if I should start investing now or wait till I have saved enough for my PR since that is my ultimate goal at the moment. If I should start investing now, where should I start? In Singapore's economy or Australia's or the US? I'm 24, single and stopped my university halfway when my visa to work in Australia got approved (I'm planning on continuing after getting a PR). I'm leaning to low risk investments (I'm new to this and have never invested in anything before) and I prefer something like passive investing. Thanks everyone for your help!1 answerAnswerBump0"

It's perfect for passive and beginner investors such as yourself!​What it does is - it basically takes a equaivalent portion or % (depending on your preferred settings) of your daily expenditure & automatically invests it into ETFs! ​What's great about this is you can also full customise the risk you're willing to take in these funds which of course, then determines how much returns you'll eventually get on your daily spending/savings!​0 comments0"
