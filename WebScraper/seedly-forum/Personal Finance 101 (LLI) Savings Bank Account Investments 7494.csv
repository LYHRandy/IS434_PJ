1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Dec 2018Starting pay for uni grad is about 3.4k, roughly 6 month's equivalent for emergency funds would be 21k (can be lesser if you have a bond/secured a job for x number of years). The approx. 20k can be put in high interest savings account (CIMB) or savings+current account (OCBC 360, DBS Multiplier).Now you're left with about 10k. You can allocate (100 - age formula) 75% in equities, with the remaining 25% in bonds.For stocks, you can choose to go with either ETFs, roboadvisors or buy the stocks individually. The former two are less time consuming and much more friendlier choice for first-time investors. However, do note that market sentiment has been weakening so returns will be rather limited with whatever options you go with.As for bonds, you can go for Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) though I feel it's oversubscribed. You can take your time to explore different various options available. A reminder not to lump investments and insurance together.0 comments2"

You can invest the rest in something that suits your risk appetite.If your risk appetite is high, learn about stocks/REITs; how to analyse them, etc. If not, you can consider bonds/fixed deposits/singapore savings bond. Alternatively, check out robo advisors, which caters to your risk appetite.0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Dec 2018As the others have mentioned, create an emergency fund first. Then read up on investments then start investing with a small amount using some of the balance. If you want a shortcut, pay to attend an investment workshop and find a mentor to guide you. That's what I did to achieve my plan of retiring early 0 comments0"
