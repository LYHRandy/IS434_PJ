question,"ETF Online Brokerages Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Jun 2019I really want to invest in US S&P 500. I see so many people giving different recommendations. Can you please recommend which brokerages or organisations I can use to invest small amounts monthly?I heard somewhere that I should choose a brokerage which provides good fees. Certain brokerages are better when investing in the US market so on and so forth, hence anyone has any recommendations for the US S&P500? Thanks!3 answersAnswerBump5"

1,"Darren ChewLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 27 Jun 2019Based on what i know, you can't invest on S&P 500 ETF on a monthly basic.The alternative is to invest in a Unit Trust fund that invest directly into S&P 500 index.The unit trust name is Infinity U.S. 500 Stock Index Fund.You can invest this on POEMS platform from $100 per month and there are no sales charges, switching fee and platform form.However, do noted that you have to first invest $1,000 into this fund as that is the minimum investment amount required before you can commence your monthly investment.Hope that help.3 comments6"

ProdigyUpdated on 28 Jun 2019Hi,The simplest way i would say is to create a brokerage account with brokers who giver access to foreign markets such as Saxo, DBS Vickers etc. I personally use Saxo. Buy into the S&P 500 on a monthly basis, but of course this isn’t a DCA programme, rather you have to purchase it every month, also for Saxo the fees to invest in the U.S is one of the lowest, also S&P 500 is USD250+, so in SGD it will cost almost SGD400. This is just one way to do it, do your own research and see what fits you. Hope this helps.2 comments0"
4,Question Poster28 Jun 2019Thank you. I think I will go with the Saxo option after doing all the due diligence. I see 2 Saxo apps. Saxo Trader and SaxoInvestor. I assume I should get the SaxoInvestor app right?SKShabir Khan28 Jun 2019Yes that’s correct

Try the app - my wall st on android or iOS . they are US based and have their own brokerage based in the US  - they allow fractional share investing and the commission is like 0.99 per trade. Foreigners are eligible and setting up the account is easy and just 5 dollars.0 comments0
