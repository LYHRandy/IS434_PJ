1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 21 May 2019Yes! I do remember his story. I think it's a great story to share regarding how insurance works, it's original intent and why it's a pretty good strategy when covering downside. (for this specific reason)It goes something like this:When renovating your homeYou would buy 1 x fire extinguisher for each roomIf you spend overly much on 3 or 4 fire extinguishers in each room, it does not make economic sense to spend excessive amounts of moneyYou'd rather spend that excess amount of money on things outside of fire extinguishers. For example, cupboards, painting etc.To draw the comparison here with Insurance:When designing your lifeYou should buy 1 x insurance coverage for each segment of your lifeFor example, Term life covers you in the event of death, Critical Illness cover you in the event of critical illnesses (eg Cancer, etc), Hospitalisation covers you in the event of Hospital and surgical needsSo ideally you don't have too many insurance policies which overlapTherefore, term insurance is like a cost-effective fire extinguisher. It exists due to an event of fire (or emergency). Nothing overly fancy.Pretty much something like this. I hope I'm giving enough credit to the story he shared. In fact Christopher shared with me this story 2 years ago, which till today sticks with me!Hopefully Christopher Tan jumps in and explain it to you nicely and in a more wholesome way as well.0 comments7"
