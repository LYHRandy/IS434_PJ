question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Apr 2019Could anyone give advice for career change?Good afternoon Seedly Community. I'm currently 23, a struggling financial advisor with an engineering diploma certification. I'm on the brink of leaving the industry due to poor performance and stress but I am not upset about it. I'm planning to pick up a valuable skill (digital marketing or investment?) compared to going back to school and spending 3-4 years achieving a certification. But unsure what skill to pickup and how's the market like.Insights are much appreciated. Thank you :)2 answersAnswerBump0"

Right now I am only 26. I know its a tough being an advisor. And for all we know, I might have the same struggles before as you had them now.There are many valuable skills out there, from targetted marketing, HR management, sales advisory, financial advisory, etc are all valuable skills.Pick something you are interested in, and am ready to put in the time to master it.
Lastly if you have a mentor, speak to him/her too.Wishing you all the best!1 comment3"

Its a tough job.If you're 100% leaving the industry, then I'd look at choosing another industry first before looking at specific skills to pick up.You need to enjoy your next position. If you're ever considering to stay, sales and digital marketing are key. Attend Eric Feng, Sanjay Tolani events. Learn how to run ads, create marketing funnels, opening presentations, handle objections, etc.It's helped me loads. I'm lucky to start because I had DM skills by running FB ads, but learning from Sanjay himself has been the biggest help.1 comment2"
