1,"Alvin ChowLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 11 Jul 2018My friend has backtested a deep value investing strategy and got a Sharpe ratio more than 1. So it isn't true that it was higher risk with small caps, even though I don't believe using Sharpe Ratio as a good way to measure risk taking. Even equating volatility to risk is debatable. But that's for the academics and practitioners to fight it out.â€‹http://treeofprosperity.blogspot.com/2014/06/back-testing-cnav-like-portfolio-using.html0 comments0"
