1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Apr 2019If you only want to trade sgx listed counters then S27 is your only option. If dbs vickers allow you to access other markets, consider SPY in the US market, or the Irish domiciled equivalents available through LSE. The latter had less withholding fees for dividend payouts as compared to the former.
