1,"Tai ZhiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jul 2018At present moment, FX hedging is very costly especially for portfolios below S$1m in size. We do not foresee FX hedging cost reducing to a cost-efficient level over the next few years.​As and when hedging cost significantly reduces to a cost-efficient level, we will be more than happy to offer FX hedging option to our clients.​You may also note that USD and SGD are major currencies and they tend to be relatively more stable compared to other emerging markets currencies.​Therefore, while FX risk is material, FX risk is not significant. This is especially so for investors who have a medium to long term investment horizon. For example, the AutoWealth Balanced Portfolio (60% stocks, 40% govt bonds) achieved 15.7% returns net of fees on a USD basis over the last 26 months since inception. The same portfolio achieved 16.4% net of fees on a SGD basis over the same period. Therefore, the difference of 0.7% due to FX impact is relatively small.0 comments1"
