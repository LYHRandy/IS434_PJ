Also if you believe in diversification, purchasing of singapore reits or stocks increases your concentration in geographical risk of Singapore (ie. our careers in Singapore, property in Singapore, etc)​IWDP ETF - listed in LSE, gives exposure to developed markets property yield. Skewed largely to US (50%)​IPRP ETF - listed in LSE, gives exposure to the European property yield. largest exposure in Germany (35%)​1343 ETF - listed in japan, gives exposure to Japanese reits. ​​​0 comments0"
