WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hi, Douglas here. 2nd Keynote speaker.If you have the budget, like I always advise my clients, go for a 2 bedder as it gives you a wider pool of buyers and tenants.If the budget is out, a 1 bedder is still workable but make sure the location, accessibility and amenities around it makes sense.​​​
You can always connect with me via https://www.facebook.com/douglas.chow.908 or simply whatsapp/sms my company 24/7 hotline @83324283
Remember, plan your finances properly, don’t overstretch, do your homework and enjoy your property investment journey.
