1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019How many more years before you turn 55? Currently CPF have only stated basic sum at 2020 to be $90.5k, thus FRS will be x2 at $181k.After age 55, u can top up to the ERS level which is 3x the basic. The earlier u contribution, the more days it will start accruing interests. Interests are accrued daily but credited yearly. Do add me on my facebook if you require further advice. 2 comments0"

You can just topup $7k to your SA to enjoy the max tax relief every year. Just contribute for as many years as possible. CPF will revise and publish the limit every few years. But I don't you need to bother about it. Since it is voluntary, just topup every year if you wish to save for retirement and receive the tax relief. If u ever hit the limit, it is just good news.
