MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Ignoring emergency fund, insurance and housing which have been taken care of:Equity Investment for Income or expense coverage.​Eg. if your mobile phone is $50 per month aka $600 in 12mths.A $10k investment into a 6% dividend yield will cover your mobile phone bill.​You can micro manage your $100k into 10, 10k and work towards ""Extra Income"" or ""Covering Expenese"".​I would only advice you to go into business when you have the required skill and network.​Take note when you micro manage your money, you lower ur risk of default too.​

God of WisdomAnswered on 26 Sep 20183-6% monthly is 36-72% p.a.You can only get that kind of return writing options or trading forex or CFDs.This is very high risk activities and requires knowledge, skill, and time.Another option is to start your own business. Your return is pretty much unlimited. 0 comments3"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Sep 2018Very possible using management of an options portfolio. I'm growing my account by between 1-10% on a month to month basis, and looking to double my account size by end of this year. Planning to use my portfolio to allow me to retire within the next 3 to 5 years. Won't say that it is possible to double account size every year, but it is very possible to achieve 30-40% returns on an annual basis for a start. Let me know if you need help to start on this methodology. Cheers 0 comments2"
5,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Sep 2018I think maybe you meant 6% - 10% p.a? I would think you can start with building up your cashflow portfolio?​So maybe REITs which gives out quarterly dividends for you to tide by? So with a portfolio size of $100k that would give you maybe around 8% average = $8000?​Use that to switch a job (which hopefully is less stressful) while you continually build up on your portfolio for dividend income. ​I think this makes more sense... and safer as well.0 comments2"

7,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 Sep 2018I did get it as a one off fluke. I do options. Got $25 for locking up $750, over one month. ROI? 40% per year. Today, that stock is banished into the depths of the abyss of US stocks, with its value at less than $2.50. If I had bought the stock,willingly or otherwise, it would be a loss of 66.7% of original capital. So question is, do you want consistent gains, but at a slightly lower rate of returns, or do you want a higher rate of returns, but inconsistent? 0 comments1"
8,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 20193% to 6%  monthly is insanely high amount of risk. Other than Business, Forex and CFDs, it's quite impossible to do it consistently. 2017 was an amazing year which allowed some of my clients to achieve more than 35% returns but I doubt I could do the same this year.For something more consistent with moderate risk, there are dividend paying structures that pays out about 5 - 7% annually with a relatively strong track record of pay out.3 comments1"

10,"Chen QijianLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 26 Sep 2018First of, i dont think those returns are realistic for a retail investor / trader. Public markets are VERY efficient.​Second you probably have better luck starting a small side business which can generate a pretty nice yield ~ recoup capital in 6 months etc ​The alternative is to invest that 100k and take a pay cut to work another job which has a better environment.0 comments0"
11,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Sep 2018I'm not going to answer your question directly, but I would encourage you to ask yourself what your motivation is for quitting the salaried job market. There is no perfect boss, so your main motivation should not be ""cos bosses suck"". All of them suck in one way or another.Instead, you should ask yourself whether you are willing to give up (relative) stability and certainty for the vagaries of a financial market, or the uncertain fruits of what you can hustle for yourself. You will definitely not be able to rely solely on investments, at least not forever. So you will need to have some form of self-employment. We only see the freedom and flexibility enjoyed by self-employed people, but not all the sweat, tears and hustling they need to do, or the anxiety they suffer when the world's markets are down and no one wants to buy anything. Also, do you want to start a family in the future? If so, will your income replacement be enough, or will you likely need more? Will the stability of a salaried job then become more important to you?Do talk to some of the self-employed people in this group and understand their pains before you decide whether you want to strike out on your own.0 comments0"

13,"See all 3 comments Jonathan Chia Guangrong26 Sep 2018Short sell US stocks.. You are kidding right? Mainly bull market right now. Unless you are doing that to very volatile currently hot  stocks, which is heart attack insane. One night, two nights, maybe. Every night? Don't think can last for long. The other way I know to gain a few hundred a night, consistently, is via futures trading. 2 hours and you are done. Either you are stopped out by the broker or you achieved your profit target. Can go either way. I'd rather sleep well at night with my sort of returns Jeff Yeo26 Sep 2018Author is asking for 3-6% return monthly. Doesn’t state that it needs to be something stable and safe. Most investment tools will not be able to generate that monthly. There is also no indication that the person is a new investor. Answering the question to the point not saying it is a good idea. At the end of the day the author needs to evaluate each option and makes a decision bearing the risks."

15,"Lim Chun Long Jimmy, Distributor at Newbrand Organic Green TeaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Sep 2018Looks like you are looking into getting multiple passive income sources.​There are many ways to do so, one way is to trade Forex and/or CFDs. However, as Forex and CFDs are leveraged trading, you must at least do the following to minimise your risks:Find a mentor who can teach you how to trade. If you want to do so via an investment course, do check out the Seedly reviews to help you make smart decisions.Apply risk management, keep each trade to at most 1-2% risk of your trading account balance. E.g. if each trade is capped to 1% risk, you need to lose 277 consecutive trades to lose your whole account balance. If you find the right mentor, you should not lose that many consecutive trades.​Other ways to earn passive income including but not limited to:Dividend stocks including REITsHigh-grade Government bond couponsProperty rentalFine Art rental0 comments0"
