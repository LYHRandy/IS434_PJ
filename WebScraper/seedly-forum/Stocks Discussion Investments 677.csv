1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 15 Aug 2019Frasers Property owns and develops one of my few favouritem malls, Bedok Point. As the property market has grown in Singapore, more attention has been placed on stocks from property developers.
These data had been takenf rom the SGX website as well as the firm's annual report. In general, the company has relatively strong financial ratios such as the current ratio, but the performance of the company had tapered over time.OutputDue to the slow down in growth, the F-Score actually awarded less points to the firm. All in all, a score of 4 is a neutral score. As the valuation of the shares are high as well, one might need to pay further attention to future prospects of the firm.0 comments1"
