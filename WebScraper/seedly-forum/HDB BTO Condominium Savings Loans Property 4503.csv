1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do what you've been doing. :) ​I believe you use the condo rental income to pay for itself for the one rented out.So does the HDB.​There should be balance from the HDB rental or some from the condo to help fund the condo you've been staying. ​So continue to do so and work part time if you want to or do whatever that makes you felt fulfilling (voluntairy work, teach someone something you know best but they donno, just like Seedly) since your property mechanism are more or less self-funding and you still have CFP retirement $ for retirement. ​Thus enjoy life now with what you have, enjoy the time with your love ones and so on :) 2 comments2"

Basically you just need to assess if you can afford it.​2 comments0"

Any emergency funds? Yes

Can the rental income cover your expenses plus all mortgage? not all
... (more)Serene Toh04 Oct 2018I agree with Tang. The important thing about retirement is not to stress about it. But most importantly, instead of asking people what you should do, you need to assess your position and consider what you want instead (after working so hard you deserve it). After you know what you really want, the surrounding noise will be cancelled out and the more feasible options will present themselves to you."
