1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jan 2019Short answer, yes.To break down the question better, a secured credit card is only issued when you deposit a minimum of $10K with the card-issuing bank. Why $10K? Because MAS says so, really!Other than UOB and HSBC, the following banks also issue secured credit cards1) POSB: https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/support/card-application-eligibility.html2) CIMB: https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/content/dam/cimbsingapore/personal/cards/forms/form-secured-card.pdf (This is a link to the application form though.)Also, another article you can refer to:https://theshutterwhale.com/blog/2017/1/7/how-to-get-a-credit-card-you-do-not-qualify-for-in-singapore-secured-credit-cardsHope all these helps!0 comments2"
2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 28 Dec 2018Secured credit card is a credit card thatâ€™s issued by banks against your investments such as fixed deposit. Theoretically, all banks can since they issue credit cards and have FD. However from bank bazaar, it does seem only HSBC and UOB offer secured credit cards or could be their rates are better.https://www.bankbazaar.sg/fixed-deposit/credit-cards-against-fd.html?ck=Y%2BziX71XnZjIM9ZwEflsyDYlRL7gaN4W0xhuJSr9Iq7aMYwRm2IPACTQB2XBBtGG&rc=1https://www.bankbazaar.sg/secured-credit-card.html?ck=Y%2BziX71XnZjIM9ZwEflsyDYlRL7gaN4W0xhuJSr9Iq7aMYwRm2IPACTQB2XBBtGG&rc=10 comments1"
