1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 May 2018That is a sound strategy, splitting into SSB and STI ETF. The allocation is entirely up to your risk profile. Allocating more to ETF can mean higher potential growth but also subject to more volatility. Allocating more to SSB can mean stability and stable returns but also lower potential gains.â€‹Going for holiday is also good, we all need to relax once in a while!0 comments0"
