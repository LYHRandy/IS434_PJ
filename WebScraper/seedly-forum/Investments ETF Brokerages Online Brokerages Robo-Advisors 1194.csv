question,"Investments ETF Brokerages Online Brokerages Robo-Advisors Asked by AnonymousAsked on 22 May 2019Which broker to use for US ETF e.g. vanguard snp 500? Saxo or td ameritrade. Quite confused by the many costs.. Also, is roboadvisors another “alternative” to invest in us etf? I would like to buy and hold US etf, before dabbling in the rest.I’m a beginner investor, for example I’m looking at start with probably $3000, and subsequently $1000 every 3 months, into only one or two US etf. (Since I’m just getting started, would like to save $ + learn more first)1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I've been using TD Ameritrade for a number of years and really like the straightforward platform and robust charting tool. No hidden fees as far as I know. Can't comment about saxo as I've not used it in any capacity. And yes robo advisories are an alternative to invest into Etfs, US domiciled or otherwise. Only thing is you cannot choose which are the etfs you want to buy into. The portfolio will be constructed based on your risk profile that is determined when you open the account and answer their cka questions.0 comments0"
