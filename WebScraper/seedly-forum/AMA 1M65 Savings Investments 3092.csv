1,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018It started off when I lost a lot of money during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis in property and in the stock market. Thereafter, I realised how weak my personal finance knowledge is. I then sought good advice from a financial mentor who shared openly with a good heart .Thereafter, I learnt the power of compounding and thrift and the rest is history. Regarding CFA, I personally have not gone through the course so I do not know what it entails. But if I were to be a case study, then I do not believe that CFA is needed to be a good investor.0 comments0"
