question,"Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 26 Sep 2018Do we need to return the CPF and interest in cash when the cash proceed is negative after selling flat?We plan to apply for BTO flat and sell our current resale flat. After doing calculation, we got negative cash proceed which can’t cover the used CPF and interest. This is because we bought flat during peak and now the similar transaction record is lower by 60-70K than our purchased price. Do we need to fork out cash to return to CPF? We are using bank loan.3 answersAnswerBump0"

ProdigyAnswered on 27 Sep 2018As mentioned, you wouldn’t need to top up cash to your CPF OA in the case of negative sale if you sell your unit at market price. You would still be required to write an appeal to CPF Board to tell them your situation by logging into your CPF homepage using your Singpass!0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 27 Sep 2018In a case of negative sale, you need not top up CASH to your CPF account.​The usual sales proceeds will be used to clear off your existing loan and accurred interest first, then remaining will be refunded back to your CPF-OA account.​If the sales proceed is less then the above, you do not have to top up ur CPF-OA account with CASH.
