1,"Benuel GanesanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 30 Aug 2018For your first question, you may want to ask a Citi customer service officer directly to get a definitive answer.  For your second question, the earn rates on bill offset is quite low. You would have been better off with a cash back card.  If you don’t have an alternative use for the miles,  don’t plan to fly anytime soon - then that’s one option. But bear in mind that Citi miles don’t expire So you can afford to hold them for a while until you find a use for it. 0 comments1"

The points don’t expire so you can accumulate for a long time.​i would recommend that you get a cash back card like BOC family or UOB one if you are not planning to chase air miles​0 comments0"
