Credit limit will still be the same.Maybe the consideration is to cancel both cards from Citi or should just keep the cards?If so when cancel both cards:after 6 or 12mths, think can enjoy new sign up giftsno need to worry about calling them to waive your annual feesIf keeping both cards:whenever got special promo (e.g Starbucks) can take out and use for specific occasioncredit limit (if a concern) stays throughout even after not workingMy 2 cents and assumption..0 comments0"
