1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 02 Apr 2019I gotta agree with Jonathana - Subway is not my idea of fresh/healthy food as well. I always wonder about the 'Eat Fresh' slogan when I see the tomato slices lying there for hours.I think that while there is a part of the world that values healthy eating, there is still the mainstream that is looking for taste over health. In Singapore alone, just look at the snaking queues for bubble tea. When I was in L.A., I definitely felt that the folks there are more health conscious, but also because it was trendy to eat avocado toasts and acai bowls.On to McDonalds itself.85% of the company in 2016 was represented by franchisee-run locations. Here's the thing: McDonald’s makes much of its revenue by buying the physical properties and then leasing them to franchisees, often at large mark-ups, instead of collecting a lot in royalties or selling its franchisees cooking equipment.Additionally, we know that McDonalds had recently announced in end March 2019 that they will acquire Israeli startup Dynamic Yield, a technology company focused on personalization and decision logic, for $300 million. The aim is to create a more personalized experience that will include new outdoor digital drive-thru menu displays that can change depending on the time, weather, current restaurant traffic and trending menu items. Additionally, the tech will also be applied to digital customer experience touch points, including self-order kiosks and its Global Mobile App. All this is to look at increasing 1. average customer spend and 2. order volume. You can see where they are headed with this.On a side note, I realize the last McDonald's meal I had cost me $10! It just baffles me how much one can spend on fast food, which is supposed to be cheap.0 comments1"
2,"Chris Lee Susanto, Founder at The Value Investing Mentorship Club™Level 2. RookieAnswered on 06 Apr 2019There is more to a stock that simply the general market trend. The premiums that markets are willing to pay for a particular stock depends upon many factors. Not only the long term economic trends, but also the structure of company, profitability, debt management, competitive positioning, managements etc. So Mcdonald may or may not be an outlier. It really ultimately depends on eventually, the business results.0 comments0"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Cutting dividend is always a unpopular decision  and the market will react accordingly. That said, you need to look at Mcd in a differ light other than being a fast food joint. Think of it as being in real estate. Not really evident here but in places where land is plentiful like in the US, they will set up shop in the middle of nowhere and later you will find that the area becomes a thriving hub with other stores coming in. Btw, subway is not really healthy either. What with gmo ingredients being used0 comments0"
