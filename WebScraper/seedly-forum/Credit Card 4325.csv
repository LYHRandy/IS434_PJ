This card is specifically target at tertiary students, hence no minimum income or spending. If i do not recall wrongly, they will be able to provide a credit limit of 500 per month.​Aim for such credit cards is to collect data from students, and when they finally graduate and start working, they will be able to qualify for the other CITIBANK cards.​Each bank has their own student credit card​0 comments2"

For a few reasons:​it’s merely a lead generation tool to have you in their system for them to upell u further products in the futre​students should Never be spending money you do not have (eg credit)​there are close to no good benefits (points are worth nothing) if u stay within the credit limit​there are better debit cards eg by DBS which offer u between 5% to 10% cash rebates.​cool! All the best :)​also last thing. Dont make this mistake like me, cos i also got the CLEAR card and canceled, now when i started working, im no longer considered a NEW MEMBER ON CITI. Means i dont get additional cash vouchers when i sign up for a proper card :)0 comments2"
