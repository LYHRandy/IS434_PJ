1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Jul 2018Very much personal circumstances. But if you fall into the median range like most ordinary Singaporeans with no exceptional happening e.g. nobody ripped off your Dad in an investment as a child, scaring you forever, age is a good baseline to start with when considering your risk appetite. Engaging in questionaires can give you a better picture as well. 0 comments1"
2,"I-Min ChuaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 20 Jul 2018Yes. We should be able to take more risk when younger as in the event of loss, we still can make back with work. as we age, our jobs are not certain0 comments0"
3,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Jul 2018Both; but personal circumstances would be more relevant. To me, age affects in the planning of x amount of years to retirement; my expected remuneration at different stages of life and expenses with the embarkment of new stages (say, getting married and kids etc.).​However that can be very general and financial planning is a very personal thing which should be customized for you. Everyone have different timeline - I have friends still making the most out of their education at 30 (yet to go into workforce) and friends who had kids way earlier that they are at the stage of preparing for the kids education (university). That, coupled with other factors like # of dependents, effect of dependents, lifestyle choices etc. are all personal and different.​Hope this helps!0 comments0"
4,"Daniel LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 07 Jul 2018I second what Luke had mentioned, age doesnt really matter in determining your risk appetite but would be a good baseline to start with. In my opionion, when determining a person's risk appetite, it is your personal circumstances and expectations for yourself that will determine the type of risks you should be exposed to. ​An example would be this: Imagine a 20 year old university student who had just won 2.3Million from singapore sweep, based on his financial plan, he will be able to construct an investment strategy that is both low risk and provides for a steady stream of passive income for the rest of his life. If his risk appetite is based on his age, he will then have to foresake a conservative investment strategy that can already provide him with the financial freedom and take on an aggressive portfolio for no good reason.​On the other hand, if we're looking at a 45 year old individual with $40k savings and wanting to achieve $80k for his children's education in lets say 5 years time without additional contribution. How likely is it that he will be able to achieve the that amount if he were to adopt a balance / conservative investment strategy if based on the a risk appeitite as derived by his age? ​At the end of the day, you have to understand that investments, insurance, risk appetite, etc are all simply a means to an end. Your risk appeitite and return requirements will be determined not only by your age but most importantly your personal circumstances and what your ""end game""0 comments0"
