question,"Investments Unit Trust Stocks Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Jun 2019Hi everyone, is building a portfolio in stocks or unit trust better?I had about 60k in Unit Trust (CPF), 43k in Unit trust (Cash) and about 20k in stocks (DBS and CapitalMall).  Was thinking of moving away from Unit trusts hence started transitioning over to the stocks in groups of 10k.  Is this a good idea for mid-long term portfolio building?3 answersAnswerBump0"

As Hariz mentioned, a stock cannot replicate a unit trust. How much you allocate towards unit trusts and stocks should be aligned to your desired portfolio strategy and risk profile taking into account your life stages, etc. There are people that are heavier in unit trusts while there are also others that are heavier in stocks. It boils down to their strategy and risk profile. It will be beneficial for you to think through whats your strategy and risk profile. This will help you to decide your allocation. Aim to build well diversified investment portfolio. A well diversified portfolio as much as one can, should be diversified across the 6 major asset classes.2 comments4"
2,"Question Poster12 Jun 2019Good points raised, and yeah, for sure that stocks cannot replicate the diversity, but I guess another consideration this question comes about is, is unit trust diversity a risk as well as impacting any potential upside?Clarence Chua12 Jun 2019Typically when we take more risks, it also means our potential rewards are higher. It just wouldn’t make sense if we take more risk and potential rewards are not higher. 

This is why the allocation should always be aligned with your portfolio strategy and risk profile.  

Of course this does not mean UT is less risky than stocks or vice versa.

Holding just 8-10 stocks is still a very concentrated portfolio. Your Unit Trust holdings are probably invested in hundreds of companies at the same time. You can't replicate that with individual stocks.0 comments2"

WonderkidAnswered on 12 Jun 2019Yes,why not,you can branch out to othher area such as STI ETF or bond ETF:http://sonicericsg.blogspot.com/2019/02/post-79week-61learning-investingtrading.html ,currently most SG stock are hit hard by the trade war,hence you can also consider US stock
 Tip 1: Long-Only Investing for Retail InvestorsInvest in Stock & Bond ETFs.For Singapore Stock & Bond ETFs, that's ES3 & A35. Use  110 - your age  for the Stocks: Bond ETF ratio.Remember to rebalance once every year. (i seldom rebalance though)Buy & Sell to bring your stocks & bonds to that  110 - your age  ratio.Consider exposure in other markets, e.g.. S&P500, China Large-Cap ETFs, etc., for diversification & growth If an ETF shuts down, its assets get handed back to the shareholders. A 100%-equities portfolio is also a bad idea. STI's more tightly linked with economies like China and Malaysia and Indonesia than it is with the US and EU.In the long run, an investor's return is measured as earnings per share growth + dividends + changes in valuation(PE ratio).0 comments0"
