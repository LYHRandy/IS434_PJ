I am thinking of buying into the US ETF market. Also thinking which platform do people use most of the time?

Withholding tax will drop from 30% to 15% much better. Go for CSPX for purely S&P500 or you can go for IWDA for world etf more diversification. CSPX also accumulate dividends back into the fund so you wont receive any dividends but the share price will increase more. You can go look at standard chartered also not bad.0 comments1"
