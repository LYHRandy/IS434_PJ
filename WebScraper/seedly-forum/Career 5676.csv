MasterUpdated on 31 Jul 2019Depending on how much time you have, and where your knowledge lies, there are many side hustles you can do:Sell things on CarousellIf you have things to sell, or even are willing to buy things in bulk to resell, then this could work for you. However, you will ahve to think of ways to get cheaper material to sell, and think of a way to make yourself different from others selling similar productsTeaching tuitionOne of the most common side-hustles.It is also one of the ones that helps you to earn the most. Depending on the level and subject, you can easily earn more than $200 a month, by teaching only 2 hrs a week. there are also many platforms which help you to facilitate the finding of students. Of course, word-of-mouth is always the best way to be able to gain more customers of you want to earn more.Micro-influencingIt's not known to a lot of people, but there are companies that actually facilitate people who have a following of 500 and more, to advertise their products. You earn about 20-30 cents for every engagement on your post, but it's a low effort for some extra cash. It's quite prevalent in HK, and one of them, called Spread-It, is actually coming to do it in Singapore as well.Freelance projectsBe it design, or marketing plans, or any skills that you have, there could always be people who are interested in them.

2,"Jia Ni TohLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 31 Jul 2019Great question. I've researched this area myself. It's good to start looking into whether you have a hobby or skill that you can use to make money, as GrabFood would leave you exhausted and isn't particularly well paid.If you're a musician, look into playing at weddings, bars, etc. This involves cultivating contacts and building a web presence and marketing yourself on social media. But the process of learning how to self-promote on Twitter etc is also extremely valuable.Can you write? If yes, figure out what sort of writing suits you best and do it freelance.
I've also seen many talented artists selling their webcomics, and I have bought from some of these people. This also involves self-promotion, and if you sell physical copies, you have to deal with the printers and with mailing the work out.
Lastly, before you think its impossible to make any money out of art, look at this article: https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/. It's a theory that says you only need 1000 true fans to make a living with your art. Since you're just looking for a sideline, maybe 500 would satisfy you?0 comments0"
