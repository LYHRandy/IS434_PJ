God of WisdomUpdated on 14 Jun 2019If you believe in the future outlook of the top 30 companies in Singapore then it doesn't matter when you enter the market.However, the STI has not rebounded from its highs pre 2008 recession. Its been extremely flat since. And not many people are confident of its future performance even without the recession warning. I personally wouldn't invest in our country's equities. Our bonds are great though.So I suggest looking elsewhere. And even if you're worried about a global recession, go in slow. As long as you're not investing everything today, you can split it over 12 months. And invest every quarter.0 comments3"
