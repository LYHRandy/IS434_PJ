question,"Family Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Dec 2018What jobs can my aunt (late 60s) consider if she wants to earn passive income? ?Sorry if my qns is vague, but upon seeing my aunt trying very hard to sell health products (she only has 1 pax so far), earning only about 20-40 Usd commission unless someone bought $100+ worth. Wondering if there are some other jobs that she can pick up for extra passive income other than stocks etc in which she may not be able to pick up? AFAIK, she is still working at her old job but due to circumstances, she is also covering for her grandson (primary) expenses - school, day to day etc2 answersAnswerBump0"

Passive income refers to things with minimal effort that will generate cash for you ie. investing. For jobs wise, it really depends on education level, whether she can handle technology, mobility, time commitments etc.For one, there are many part time jobs out there, or freelancing work. One simple example is tuition. Especially for mandarin teachers, there is less supply, and people tend to lean towards older teachers for that. So that could be an area your grandmother can look into!0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 01 Jan 2019My advice would be to find a proper permanent job (which you mentioned she has). She should be entitled to WIS - Workfare which pays additional in the event the salary she is drawing, is below $2,000. I believe it should be enough because WIS would have given her additional $120 cash and $180 cpf per month for a salary of $1,200.00.Is she literate and able to write books, etc instead? Or maybe go be a trainer etc for cooking class? Any passion she has other than selling health products?0 comments0"
