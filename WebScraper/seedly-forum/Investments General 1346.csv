1,TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 12 May 2019I feel that its a good way to reduce risk/losses and also help promotes good investing habits thru DCA and regular investing. Downside is that it may incure more sales charge if your DCA amount is low and the bank charges a high min sum0 comments0
2,"Jansen Ng, Business Student at NtuLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 10 May 2019Short answer: Yep.Long answer: If the market is consistently on an uptrend, lump sum definitely beats DCA.But if the market is on a downtrend, DCA beats lumpsum.How about if the market fluctuates and ends at the same price as at the start of your investment? (assuming the start and end of investment period is the same price)Zero capital appreciation for lump sum investing (0% returns)Gains achieved from DCA. Because of the idea of DCA, we actually buy more units when the price is lower, and buy less when the price is high. Hence, if we dollar average the units bought, it will be lower than the starting priceConsider the following simplified example: 1st mth: 1k at $1 = 1000units 2nd mth: 1k at $1.1 = 909units 3rd mth: 1k at $0.9 = 1111units 4th mth 1k at $1 = 1000unitsTotal number of units: 4020units for 4k ($0.995 per unit) Compared to lump sum where its 4000units for 4k ($1 per unit)Simplified example, but the idea is thereHence DCA is advised because we wouldnt accurate guess where the market is headingOther advantages includeEasier, no need to think, just do. Can even RSP and set up once and forget about itLeaves emotions out of the gameSets aside a certain amount of salary to be channelled here, ie invest the money as it comes, to get more time in the marketNot necessarily DCA every month. Some do it monthly, some quarterly, some every 6 mths. Also depends on your investment amount (due to fees)0 comments0"
