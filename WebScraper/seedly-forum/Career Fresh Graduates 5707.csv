question,"Career Fresh Graduates Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Jun 2019What to do if companies are all hiring only senior roles for the job I'm trying to work in? I've tried looking in a lot of places and even spoken to several people in the industry but they acknowledge that everyone is trying to hire senior positions. I've worked for a year but left my previous company because of the poor environment. (to be specific, I'm looking at UX designer roles which seems to be all the rage now)2 answersAnswerBump0"

WizardAnswered on 29 Jun 2019Interestingly, I have also spoken to people who feel that they are being rejected for jobs as they are too senior, are expecting too high of a salary etc as the company can always look for fresh blood that is easier to learn. Of course, it could be industry specific. Tip: if they say they are looking to hire senior positions, ask what skill sets they are SPECIFICALLY looking for. Indeed, a young person could be smart and enthusiastic, but at the end of the day, companies are looking for people that can do good work, and that is a function of attitude and aptitude.0 comments2"
