1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Mar 2019Hello! There are three measures of exchange rate risk, value-at-risk (VaR), cash-flow-at-risk (CFaR) and earnings-at-risk (EaR) calculations. VaR is an estimate of how a company's investment might loss or gain under normal currency market conditions over a set time period. CFaR estimates how company's future cash flows may change over a set time period as result of currency market changes. Earnings at risk estimates how much income may change over a set period, based on previous earning figures; the longer the period of time analyzed the higher the exchange rate risk.0 comments1"
