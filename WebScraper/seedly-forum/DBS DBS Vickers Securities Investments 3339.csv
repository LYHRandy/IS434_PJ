If you are here asking this question, then you should be savvy enough to do your own trades. ie if you refer to this table here, it is either option 1) or 3) via the Cash upfront DBS vickers account or the normal online brokerage one. Way lower fees.​You can refer here for the full breakdown of the fees table: https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-cheapest-stock-brokerage-in-singapore/​I personally use the cash upfront option via Vickers :) https://seedly.sg/reviews/online-brokerages​All the best, and feel free to continue asking questions here also.0 comments0"
