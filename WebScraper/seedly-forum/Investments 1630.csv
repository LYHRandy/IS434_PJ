WizardAnswered on 21 Apr 2019It allows for flexibility, because there is no need to be subject to the scrutiny of public investors, or nosy analysts who are constantly asking for next quarter's projections, and estimated growth rates of each business segment.

You subject your company to regulatory requirements and disclosures, and having to answer to shareholders. You are also subject to market scrutiny and perception which will affect your company valuation.Also, think of it this way, if you can own a 100% of a great business and your business can generate its own funds for expansion, why share it with other people?0 comments1"
