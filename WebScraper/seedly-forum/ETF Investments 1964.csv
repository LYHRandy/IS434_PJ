1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019Adding on to Zann's point, the net asset value can be used to compare the performance of different funds. Investors should not pay more than the net asset value of shares. If the market value of an ETF falls, and you can therefore buy shares at a discount to NAV, it can often give you a good opportunity to get a bargain.0 comments1"
