I believe the 1M65 is still valid in the sense that as long as you are saving and investing at a high enough rate, 1 million is achieveable as long as you start young and contribute in excess to your CPFBut if you are afraid of the changes that might come in the future, why not just diversify your investments into other assets such as REITS, funds, stocks, bonds etc.0 comments0"
