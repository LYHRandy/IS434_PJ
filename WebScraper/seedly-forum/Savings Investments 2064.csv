God of WisdomAnswered on 12 Mar 2019You can usually invest everything after setting aside 6 months if your income as an emergency expense.The key here is to make sure that you're investing in something that's globally diversified and matches your risk appetite.0 comments1"

I am also assuming that you have no other big ticket items coming up, since that is a significant expense.With the remaining funds, I would then look to invest in it. You could do it the hands-on way with robo-advisors, or try your own hand at equity investments, which also require a relatively lower capital size.Later on when you have amassed a larger sum, you might want to look at other things such as property etc.0 comments0"
4,"Ernest Yeam Wee LeongLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 23 Mar 2019A better way to look at it is what percentage of your income should you be keeping aside for investing.For me when i get paid my salary every month, i set it to automatically transfer the money to my investment account, savings account, insurance account and business account.For investment account, i will transfer about 25% of my monthly salary.0 comments0"
