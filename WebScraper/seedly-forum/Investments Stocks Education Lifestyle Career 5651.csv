1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Sep 2019As someone who paid for investment courses over the years, it boils down to content, ease of use, track record, mentor's attitude, humility, willingness to honour and fix previously issued trades that go wrong. Not to mention the size of the active community. End of the day, the system must work, and continue to work or evolve over time to continue to work. And this must be shared with the community for free. Marketing and speaking at events help. Testimonials from past students, especially those who have reaped success enough from the imparted system to fire their bosses and do it full time helps. My current mentor already has a number of students who fired their bosses.0 comments0"
