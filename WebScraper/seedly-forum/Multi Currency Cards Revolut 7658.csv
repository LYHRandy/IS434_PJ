For Airport Lounge access, I have Priority Pass from my credit card and I have AMEX Krisflyer which gives me 4 lounge vouchers. I have both YouTrip and Revolut cards which both I don’t store much money in so I’m not worried about cc fraud.2 comments3"

However, compared to Standard the only real use case I can see is for lumpy currency changes that you cannot (for some reason) space out.The monthly limit is S$9k and if you can break out the exchange into lumps less than that - stick with Standard but if you are doing a particularly large FX transfer that cannot be split (around more than SGD 30k)  then the 0.5% fee that you would pay as a standard user could outweight the cost of premium.0 comments0"
