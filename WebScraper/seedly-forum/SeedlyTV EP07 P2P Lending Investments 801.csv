2,"SYSamuel Yip12 Jul 2019Yes. It would be advantageous to turn on auto invest for funding societies. It allows you to be allotted a sum of investment before the loans are open to the public.

During this pre-launch period, you can choose to opt-out from the deals if you do not want to take the risk.

Overall, it is good to always turn on the auto invest feature"

There are definite advantages for autoinvest. It gives you priorities on the loans you desired or preferred. It helps you secured your loans
You also do not have to waste time waiting for loans.
You can always opt out when u dislike the loans and put more if you prefer the risk-reward of the loans. 
Thus, I would say it will be convenient to have this auto invest function set up0 comments0"
