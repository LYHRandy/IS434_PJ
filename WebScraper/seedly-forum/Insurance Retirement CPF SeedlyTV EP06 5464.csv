God of WisdomUpdated on 01 Aug 2019You used to be able to purchase endowment and annuities with CPF monies, you can't anymore, now with OA and SA monies you can only purchase a Single Premium ILP. For your Medisave accounts, you can purchase an Integrated Shield Plan and also an Eldershield Supplement (soon Careshield Life variant).Other then the basic, already given to you, DPS, HPS, MSL, ES, CPF Life, that's it.2 comments4"
