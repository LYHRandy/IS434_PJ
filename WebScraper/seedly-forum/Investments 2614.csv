When you DCA, you're taking away the guesswork of figuring out when to enter the market. The idea here is that equities over time will have a very high probability to provide you with positive return. So just remain invested. But there will be times where you should also top up your investments. After a recession, you should put down a lump sum, and increase your DCA amount until the market rebounds.0 comments0"
