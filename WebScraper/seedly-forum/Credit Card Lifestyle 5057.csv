question,Credit Card Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 23 Nov 2018I'm doing a final semester report on why Singapore is behind in the cashless wave and when we will move to a full cashless nation? Interested to know the community opinion here?My year end thesis is that Singapore has a huge legacy system with different stakeholders which are too powerful and pulling users in their own directions. What about you?3 answersAnswerBump1

1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Governemet behind itCashless payments provide more discounts/benefitsAllows for easier trackment of paymentsMoving to cashless society will take quite a while. New technology adoption by firms has too been slow regardless of policies which can provide cost-saving with implementation of better tech. Now, the scale is the entire Singapore. It is entirely feasible, but it'll be a slow transition. Cashless payments aren't all that convenient in certain cases, hawkers in wet markets, street buskers, karang guni all prefer the cash-and-carry system. Government has to either incentivise more or mandate it to make the shift faster.1 comment1"
2,Question Poster23 Nov 2018Interesting that you think that way :) thanks for the different ideas and the thoughts behind scale. I think it could also be that cashless benefits and discounts may not be the best solution as it creates incentivised behavior which could be short-lived.

From what I do know, it reduced the hassle of money and risk of loss (if paper money). And the banks all Honor it.Then look into our strong card use, and also Hawker centres and misc uses. 0 comments0"

Even China themselves are facing huge problems in terms of converting & transforming the mindsets of their older generations to accept this new technology. I'd give it at least another good 5 to 10 years before we are even close to 80% acceptable rate for cashless tech.As to why? All about that fintech growth instucture!0 comments0
