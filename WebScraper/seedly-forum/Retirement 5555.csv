question,"Retirement Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Dec 2018Should I still pursue learning in my forties?I am reaching my forties and I realised that I have wasted my years without growth in wisdom, or even gain skill sets that can help me advance in my career. I have a degree but unrelated to my work or interests. I want to make up for my lost years but I should be learning and preparing for my retirement. I am in favour of just learning but I am afraid that I may just waste money if I can’t gain a useful skill. Would anyone like to share your experiences?3 answersAnswerBump0"

The award pays $5k. For early to mid career singaporeans who meet the requirement in various industries. http://www.skillsfuture.sg/studyawardsFor singaporeans 40 and above, I quote "" Eligible individuals will receive higher subsidies of up to 90% of course fees (See Table 1.) for over 8,000 SSG-supported courses with effect from 1 October 2015, and at least 90% of programme cost for MOE-subsidised full-time and part-time courses ranging from Nitec to postgraduate1 level in the following institutions for course semesters commencing from 1 July 2015. ""With that u can look for available course of your interest, eg in a local polytechnic http://www.skillsfuture.sg/enhancedsubsidy From what u have written, it gives me a feeling that u are experiencing burnout from your current work. Maybe u are just looking for a break? Even if the courses are free, would u still have the energy to attend them, and do the assignments ?2 comments2"

GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019It's never too late to learn new stuff, but w your current commitments you might need to prioritise. If it's sth that helps you become better at work, are there grants, sponsorships or scholarships which could help you financially and perhaps improve your career prospects?2 comments2"
4,"Question Poster15 Dec 2018Thanks for your help. There’s no grant, so I was hesitant about embarking on the qualification course.Steph Yeo18 Dec 2018Find sth if you're really keen.  Yixiong has some good suggestions i think. If you're really keen then ""energy"" should not be an issue. "

However, in terms of using funds, I wouldn’t say to do it until you are certain you wish to pursue further. Knowledge is potential power. Applied knowledge is power. Maybe you can let us know what you are keen to learn?There are some Low cost courses in udemy and if you are keen, could also go for WSQ courses that are 90% funded. If you have an ntuc card, 10% that is payable can be claimed with ntuc “ Union training Assistance program) which provides up to 50% discount up to $250.00.hipe this helps3 comments1"
6,"See all 3 comments Loh Tat Tian15 Dec 2018You can learn while building a portfolio of programs as a freelancer. Once you have a portfolio of projects, your skills are recognised and degree is just not so relevant. It doesn’t matter how you acquire the skills. Show people your final product and they will recognise your work. ImhoQuestion Poster15 Dec 2018Thanks for the idea!"
