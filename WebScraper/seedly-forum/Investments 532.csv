question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Sep 2019Should I invest in learning driving? How much does it cost nowadays?Basically I’m unsure on whether I should take this time to save up or invest in a skill like driving. My family owns a car but relies on it pretty heavily for work/errands. I’ll also have to pay for my own insurance if I’d like to drive it (~$120/month).For context, I’m 23 and officially started work in Apr. Since then, I’ve managed to save a portion of my salary consistently. However, if I invest in driving, I’ll be unlikely to reach my goal of saving ard 14k this year.1 answerAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterUpdated on 16 Sep 2019If you can afford it, having a car license is useful.1) In emergencies (both good and bad types) an extra skillset can be useful2) In vacation in large countries, having a driving license helps you to explore places. One big example is the United States, you can't absorb the essence of the USA without driving. Only driving let you realised how automobile-dependent and lifestyle this country is.(I drove in Greece, USA, UK, China, think it's really worth it)3) Touchwood, I would never recommend driving for Grab as a job, but hey as a part-time job, it's an additional option.4) Leisure is good if you enjoy driving for the sake of it (I don't enjoy driving, it's a chore to me).Do note that in the very long run (10 years?) car license may not be as valuable due to the adoption of self-driving cars =)AND having the license to drive is different from owning a car. Even if you have the license, I say don't own a car. It's terribly expensive and bad for personal finances. (I do own a car for other reasons, so pardon me discouraging it for financial reasons.)0 comments1"
