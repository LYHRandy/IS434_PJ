1,Julie TanLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I would choose to buy the cheaper flat and remodel it myself as I’m pretty sure I can do it the way I want with less than $80K. Some of the fixtures that come included with the $80K worth of Reno may not last long and also doesn’t seem to be inclusive of furniture. 2 comments2
2,Leong Wen Fong19 Oct 2018yea actually 80k feels a little excessive for a house remodelling doesn't it?Julie Tan20 Oct 2018Yeah it does! especially if one is satisfied with simpler styles/themes.
3,"Siti PutriLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The design of the place will be subjective to your liking. So if you like the design and still well maintained fixtures, then yes. 
But another point to note is, do you have the extra $80k in cash? If not, it will be part of mortgage loan which is only 1.8%-2.6% interest per year depends on bank or HDB loans. But if u chose to renovate yourself without own cash, then you have to take renovation loan which is 5% interest per year.1 comment1"
4,"Julie Tan20 Oct 2018I think you raised a really good point that this $80K can be covered using home loan instead of taking personal loan to cover for it! But I guess if one don't have the cash to pay for $80K worth of renovations anyhow, then better to live within means. At the end of the day, better to limit debt. "
5,Daniel LingLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 19 Oct 2018I had to go through this thought process myself. Here's mine.does the design really suit you.Eg: false ceiling is a trend. But it makes your ceiling lower.Things that are mounted has a lower weight limit.Reducing the concept of wide and high space for good living.Every design feature needs to be analyzed to see if it fits.80k price point is possible for a full renovationIt's not about the smarts. A lot of these designs are driven by emotions. You just have to rise about it.0 comments1

WonderkidAnswered on 19 Oct 2018Depends on what you need, do you need to move in immediately?I'd think renovation can cost less than 80k, so you can save money remodelling.How about other factors such as additional works (and thus, additional costs), the unit's location/age etc?0 comments1"
