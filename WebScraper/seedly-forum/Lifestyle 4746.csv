1,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 11 Jul 2019Personally I feel that learning driving is a must. It's a life skill that will be useful for times you never know.Then again, if auto drive cars are becoming a reality, people may not even need to learn driving anymore! Hahaha2 comments1"
2,"JWjiajing wang10 Jul 2019Learning to drive is a good skillset worth investing in. You never know if in future times, you might need to do sales which u would have an advantage if u have a license and you would understand why some drivers are such a pain in the ass on the road too . LolEric Chia11 Jul 2019Hahah yes, seeing how the person drives tells you a lot about the character!"
3,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Jul 2019Learning to drive is rather cool.I mean the smallest of situations could be driving yourself around on overseas vacations to remote vineyards and whatever.For other more serious stuff, maybe you need to help drive / send a drunk / injured / ill friend or family to home or hospital? Those are rare situations driving might come in somewhat useful?I mean what if there's an upcoming fire / earthquake / typhoon / tsunami about to hit your family, and you couldn't get away coz you can't drive? These things could happen when you are overseas0 comments0"
4,"Josh NgLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 10 Jul 2019Let's just say it's a good to have, but not an absolute must. But if you have ambition to have your own car next time (which you never know), it's better to do it and get it over and done with. As a bachelor you might not see a need for a car since Grab and public transport is so convenient but with a family, your priorities might change to accommodate babies and your senior folks. Personally I find it harder to find time to pick up driving as you get older (due to work commitments etc.) so I would lean on the side of doing it early. $1k in the grand scheme of things is not a lot, but it does buy you a lot of convenience (less hassle) next time if you find yourself in a situation with a need to drive (road-trips among all other things).0 comments0"
