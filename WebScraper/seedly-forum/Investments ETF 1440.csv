question,"Investments ETF Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Apr 2019How do I calculate the Total Expense Ratio for ETFs listed in the US, including withholding taxes? Is there a formula for this? For example, if the TER of an ETF domiciled in the US is 0.07%, and dividends are taxed at 30%, how should I include this into the calculation to get the true TER of the ETF for me? Is it also possible to factor in other costs, like bid-ask spread ratios, and if this information is readily available in the Funds' factsheets? Thank you! :)1 answerAnswerBump0"

These are ETFs, traded on a stock exchange so the bid offer spreads can be very dynamic. Dividends declared may vary also so you will need to manually track your returns I'm afraid.If withholding tax is a concern, consider robo advisories. Some may be able to claim this back from what I hear.0 comments0"
