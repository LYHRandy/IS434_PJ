1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018Definitely a NO. ​Buying of options - you need to be RIGHT 100% to even smell profits. If the price is no where near the call option's strike price upon expiry, the premium paid to purchase the call option effectively becomes toilet paper. ​Investments should be simple and easy to understand. If you don't understand how the call option will work, don't invest. Caveat emptor ​2a. Linked to the call option structure of the fund, and I quote from the product highlight sheet ""... will be linked to returns generated by the OCBC-LGI VT Index, which provides exposure to multi-assets including equities, fixed income and gold. The Index comprises of fixed income ETFs, equity ETFs, gold ETFs, indices and cash.""  Do you even understand this? How many layers of funds and (internal) fees are we talking about here? How much in fees will be saved if the call option is not in the fund?​""Fund aims to provide distributions..."" - no guarantee this will happen ​Fees and sales charges. My main bugbear when it comes to managed funds. Never a good thing. Unless you can find me a fund that returns and compounds at 40% for 20 years straight while charging 10% fees, I'll happily suck it up. ​My take on the whole thing is, if you want to invest in a bond fund, invest in a bond fund. You want options, invest in a fund comprised of options (which is treading in the realm of hedge funds). Don't mix the two, unless you are very sure of what you are getting into after listening to the TL:DR version of the prospectus pitched by the sales staff. Do your due diligence before getting into this investment, or any investments out there. ​Hope this helps, and all the best.0 comments0"
