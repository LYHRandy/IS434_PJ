1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Aug 2019We have to understand what do you determine as ""worth it"" to get in this case.(1) How long are you intending to get coverage?(2) What is your current age or Age Next Birthday(3) What aspect of the plan are you looking at? (A) Death/TPD coverage?(B) Accident protection (with HFMD? or Motorcycle riding as a rider or pillion passenger?)(C) Outpatient, CI protection, or ECI protection (not recommended for ECI though).(D) Disability protection coverage?It's tricky because if you are not clear on what aspect you are talking about, we are not able to help you much.You may want to take note from this thread instead.
