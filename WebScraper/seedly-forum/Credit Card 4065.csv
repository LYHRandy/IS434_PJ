God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Jul 2019Before getting a credit card, understand and be prepared to pay off your bills in full, or else the interest will snowball and cause even more problems.If that is not an issue, then the following factors come into play:Cashback or miles - the former usually requires some minimum spend while the latter earns from the first dollarExpenditure pattern - categorize your spending and see if there are cards out there that give more rewards based on your most common category (provided that you can meet certain card minimums)Co-branding/Pairing with your bank account - again, based on your expenditure pattern. Do not spend just to hit the minimums imposed by the bank. Co-branded cards usually are miles cards such as AMEX KrisflyerSign up bonuses - Stack those with other sites like SingsaverIncome requirement - sometimes if a good card is just out of reach, you may consider asking if the bank can relax the requirement. Most cards require $30Kp.a. income so this should not be an issue nowadays.0 comments6"

Etc)Card limitations (cashback cap, certain spend is not eligible for cashback etc)Any High interest saving account to pair with for higher interest for your savings?Current PromotionsOther terms and conditionsYou can refer to credit card comparison websites, filter and compare. Then decide on one that suit you best and donâ€™t spend for just to meet the min spend. 
You might just spend more than the cashback and interest earned.0 comments2"

GeniusAnswered on 30 Jul 2019Before deciding on what card to get, it will be best to first know what your expenditure patterns are.I would suggest tracking your three months spending behaviour to know what are the categories that you spend on more frequently and how much.Once you have the data, you can then proceed to do comparison among the various credit cards to see which one will give you the highest returns.For the types of credit cards, i wrote an article here for reference.
