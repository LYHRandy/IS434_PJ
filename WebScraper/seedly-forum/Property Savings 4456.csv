1,"Jim NgLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 09 Nov 2018Do you know of any friends that live in a condominium?You could request to use their BBQ Pits which will probably be FREE or possibly $10.70 for a 4 hour session.That's the most affordable.Otherwise you can try:Chevrons 2D1N Chalet at $280 to the public, $180 if you have a friend that is a Chevrons member:https://www.chevrons.org.sg/Facilities/Chalets-Bungalows/RatesCivil Service Club 2D1N Chalet @ Changi at $405 to the public, $265 if you have a friend that is a Civil Service Club member:https://www.csc.sg/PDF/changi-room-rates.pdf 0 comments2"
