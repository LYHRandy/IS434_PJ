1,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Nov 2018It really depends on your age and your risk profile (aggressive or conservative).  If you are a young adult and are more aggressive, go for more stocks that would generate higher but less stable returns in the long run. If you are an elderly who has reached retirement and are more conservative, go for more bonds that would generate lower but more stable returns in the short term. Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0"

Bonds can be even more exotic than stocks; Some stocks can be as steady as most bonds. Bonds doesnt mean is safe, stocks doesnt mean is risky. It just depends what u are looking at, what u are looking for, and what are they for.The question should be about your risk profile, what do u understand, and what u are comfortable with.0 comments0"

I prefer stocks for invest until fundamentals for the companies do not change. I believe that stocks investment is safe until it change the direction according to estimates. I prefer stocks investment because they don't bound me for a time period.0 comments0"

Some stocks on the other hand (over the counter stocks, usually small-mid cap) are more risky and principal may not be preserved. These stocks are more volatile and has the highest potential to grow -- potentially higher than SSB. So you'll need to balance things out and not keep all your eggs in one basket.0 comments0"
