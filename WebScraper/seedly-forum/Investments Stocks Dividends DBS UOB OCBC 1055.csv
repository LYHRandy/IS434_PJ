1,"Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 02 Jun 2019Hi, I am also looking into buying bank stocks too.  I believe there is a correlation between bank stocks and US futures/US index. I always look at the futures to determine if it is the right time to buy. As US index closed lower so I expect the bank stocks to go down on Monday. I am looking at buying DBS and UOB. All three banks are good but I pick the ones that have higher dividend yield. DBS is giving $1.20/share for dividend from FY2018 onwards and UOB started giving $1.20 too after including the special dividend. I am looking at buying them at batches as I would expect that there is more room to drop.0 comments1"
