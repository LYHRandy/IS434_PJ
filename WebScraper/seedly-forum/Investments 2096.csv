God of WisdomAnswered on 22 Mar 2019I'd suggest you to look at actively managed bond funds instead of passive bond etfs. You can hold government bonds individually like the SSB, but you should still diversify with a bond fund.  https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/how-do-bond-etfs-workHow Do Bond ETFs Track Their Indexes?Traditional bond indexes make great benchmarks, but terrible portfolios. Most equity ETFs hold every security in their index. But that's usually not possible with bonds. Bond indexes often include hundreds, even thousands, of individual securities. Buying up all those bonds for an ETF's portfolio is not only difficult, but expensive. The cost to purchase thousands of bonds in illiquid markets, even those with minimal impact on the index, can quickly erode returns.0 comments1"
