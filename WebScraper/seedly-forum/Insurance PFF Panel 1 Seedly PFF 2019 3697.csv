ProdigyAnswered on 23 Aug 2019Hi there, if you feel he needs additional hospital coverage and the family is able to share the cost on it well.I've got a summary premium calculator that you can use for free over here https://www.theastuteparent.com/2017/04/integrated-shield-plan-calculator-comparison/From my experience with private client's parents, there is usually certain health history. For certain chronic conditions, Raffles Shield can be a solution of coverage. At an older age, premiums are higher and some prefer to insure with the NTUC Incomeshield with a 10% co-payment rider to be more cost-effective.

MasterAnswered on 20 Aug 2019If there is no pre-existing condition, it really depends on their affordability.The minimum would be at least the standard plan or B1 to cover pre and post hospitalisation. That is if you can afford. Riders can be left out if you do not have enough cash to fund it.0 comments0"
