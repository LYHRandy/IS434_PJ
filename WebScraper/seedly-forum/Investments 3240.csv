1,"Ng Wei En, Bsc(Information Systems) at Singapore Management University Level 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Seedly has an article about the Temasek Bond Offer.
https://blog.seedly.sg/temasek-holdings-corporate-bond-issue-subsidary-temasek-financial-iv-private-limited/You may wish to note a bond of such quality and interest yield is usually open only to instituional investors only and usually in large denominations. This bond issue is denominated in $1000 and is easily within reach of most retail investors. You can almost think of the 2.7% interest as guaranteed given Temasek's credit rating. Also take note that you can also arbitrage your CPF OA's interest rate of 2.5% and earn an extra 0.2% if you pretty sure you won't need that sum in your OA in the next 5 years. Having said that, the bond can still be sold on SGX but its price is subjected to changes depending on interest rates. 2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster23 Oct 2018Thank you for the information! I'm actually thinking of buying with cash on hand and not CPF. What do you think of that?Ng Wei En23 Oct 2018Doesn’t hurt to put a sum which you’re comfortable with that is not gonna be needed in the next 5 years. If you have an existing investment portfolio, this would be a low-risk option to diversify your portfolio and provide some form of hedging towards the downside. "
