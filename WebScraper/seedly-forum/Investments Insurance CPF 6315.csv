1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Nov 2018This really depends on a few factors:1) Her current Age2) Her current savings3) Is the HDB fully paid for? and how many rooms are there in the HDB4) Is she intending to find a job?5) Whats her current health StatusBased on the information that you had provided, my thoughts are pretty similar to the rest in terms of the options: Hospitalisation Plan, CPF, Retirement Plans1) Hospitalisation Plan - This really depends on the health status of your mum. If she does have some minor illness, one option is for her to apply for Aviva Shield Plan with Moratorium Underwriting (have to do this soon as Aviva is phasing this option out in 2019). With such a plan, most of the concerns on hospitalisation will be covered.2) CPF - I concur with what Tat Tian suggested. This also depends on what her current age is. One suggestion is to top up the amount to meet FRS, if not, she can also opt to pledge her HDB flat to meet the FRS amount. This will enable her to receive monthly amounts from CPF Life.3) Retirement -  I assume that she is not a risk taker. Basically, there are a mix of options for her to consider which i will briefly share below:a) Retirement Plan: A lump sum payment Today which will translate into monthly payout at a later stage which will supplement her retirement income. On top of which, some retirement plans, such as Manulife's RetireReady, grants additional payouts should she be unable to perform 2 out of 6 activities of daily living. This will supplement her Eldershield payouts.b) Endowment Plan with Flexibility of withdrawalsc) Renting out one room in the HDB flat to supplement incomeHaving said so, you may wish to speak to a financial advisor that will be able to share with you more about retirement planning for your mom.

2,"Loh Tat Tian, Complex Manager at Ocean Ifm Pte LtdLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 12 Nov 2018It depends on what scheme she is currently on.Let's break it down into a few items1) Insurance: Hopefully she's still able to be insured with the standard ISP Hospitalisation Plan (this is cost effective). If not, she will have to depend on Medishield Life and Pioneer Generation / Medeka generation CHAS schemes.2) For investment, she could look at a few types like the following:a) Retirement / Endowment Plans in the market (3% with drawdown)b) If she's on the Retirement Sum Scheme, it will make a lot of sense to put it in CPF by Voluntary contribution or through Retirement Sum Topping up (RSTU) since it will earn a 6% on the first $30,000, and 5% on the next $30,000That means a 5.5% on the $60,000 in the CPF RA account. (that translates to about $3,300 interest per year). The ($140k will earn 4% interest = $5,600 each year) Total interest = $8,900If you are not worried, you can continue to do top up to the max amount (ERS) to earn extra interest.c) Singapore Savings Bond 100k maximum (for 2.43% etc) (earn $2,430)d) Banking products (which should be used to protect from inflation)like citibank maxigain account ($150k which moves with SIBOR * 80% + 1.2% for drawing interest per month less) (average 2.2%) (earn $2,200)e) 3 year or 5 year single premium insurance products. (could be 100k) (earn $2,000)Based on the above, she could potentially be looking at 3% * $500,000 = $15,000Or $8,900 + $2,430 + $2,200 + $2,000 which is $15,530These translate to roughly $1,250.00 per month for your mum.The above are the safest products around.0 comments0"
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 12 Nov 2018To protect her, u should ensure her hospitalisation insurance is appropriately covered. Upgrade her medishield to the appropriate level u prefer. What is her age? You can use the money (part) to top up her retirement account so as to be able to convert the money to CPF life in future which gives a lifetime monthly payout. Since u mentioned she has no CPF money, it is very worth to topup. The first $60k earns an additional 1%, plus additional 1% for first $30k (for age 55 and above). Effectively getting 6% on her first $30k, and 5% on $60k.Since your mum is not working, u will be able to topup her special/retirement account in your name. So u will be able to receive dollar for dollar tax relief. You will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-6% interest yearly guaranteed.Add me on my facebook if u require further discussion.0 comments0"
4,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Nov 2018It depends on her age and the risk shes willing to take. Max out her CPF special/retirement account and medisave account would be good for low risk, government backed and pretty good returns up to 5% medisave can also be used for hospitalisation but of course the monthly pay out for CPF Life only start at 65. She can also consider REITs and get like 6% dividends per annum but it will require more effort and research and there will be stock market fluctuations. SSBs is also another alternative which is low risk and government backed but the returns of holding for 10 years average annual is around 2.5% which may or may not increase.0 comments0"
