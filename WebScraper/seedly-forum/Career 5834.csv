It’s the boss’ job to try to make you stay by matching the offer, you don’t have to accept it just because.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jan 2019You can use math to determine the best package.Longer leave is essentially more money too, you are paid to do nothing about work, so it's more money. If you work only on weekdays then one day of paid leave is worth your annual salary / (5 days *52 weeks ). Total up everything to see if it matches your new pay from your current job.And yes, what if it still matches??WOW, that raise though. In that case, use other factors to decide:working hours (do you have to OT alot)career progression (do you get a promotion in the new company)work environment (what do people work there say about the company)colleagues and boss (do you like working with them)Then also ask back yourself, why did you resign in the first place0 comments0"

Maybe you can let us know what are the reasons that even made you consider staying? e.g. Nice boss, relaxing work, near you house, etc..?0 comments0"

5,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Nov 2018Is this in the same field? I feel that there is no harm trying out new things in life, and gain more exposure.If salary for both side is just the same, them realistically, it's also good to move because there are better benefits at the new job. Further more, when you stay, it could create the impression that you are staying for the money, and might cause them to think that money is the only/main thing that you can about in the job.In conclusion, I think moving is a better option at the moment! Unless you can find a compelling reason for you to stay0 comments0"
