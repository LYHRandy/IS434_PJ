question,"Insurance Family AVIVA Personal Accident Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Aug 2019Which personal accident insurance plan is good for old parents?Was looking for a personal accident insurance plan for my old parents. My friend recommended Merdeka Care. I was comparing with (for e.g.) Aviva Personal Accident Insurance. Seems like Merdeka Care provides more benefits as compare, but the coverage not as high.

I'd suggest merdekacare as well plus another policy with higher benefits. You don't have to choose just one.3 comments2"
