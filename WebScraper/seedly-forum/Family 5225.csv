Grand MasterAnswered on 23 Jun 2019There will be many things to discuss about, financial planning encompasses almost every part of our life. Every couple discussion will be different as their priorities varies too. That being said, a few common and crucial points to be discuss will be How do you guys want to manage the family finances. How much allocation to each category as a guide?When do you guys want to plan for kids (if any).
This will bring in talks about, schools, education, etc
But also what financial value will you guys want to impart to them. 
And if money is not a concern, will you guys prefer if one spouse care for the kid full time? What kind of wedding ceremony will you guys want? Whats the budget, how to reach it? What about honeymoon?Housing, when do you guys wish to have your own place. Location, budget, how do you want to split the payments etcPrenuptial agreements. To do or not to do.

Get a joint account for joint expenses and agree among yourselves how much each of you will contribute to it. I think thats the most important.0 comments0"
