4,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Oct 2018Well, how long you intend to hold them for? How do you view these stocks will perform in the next 5 to 10 years? If your view is positive, go ahead and hold them for now and double down when market tanks further to average out your cost.The decision to sell off should also come be determined by the alternatives you have. If you have no viable alternatives or strategies to park the cash, perhaps holding on may be your best bet0 comments2"
5,"Nadine PohLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 06 Nov 2018I have a similar portfolio around 120k also with about 20-30% loss. I don't need the money currently. My plan is to sit tight and continue receiving dividends. Selling anything now would just mean that I'm inking up a confirmed loss. If the companies you have invested in are solid, they probably should manage to hold up even in a market downturn. I suggest you just ride it out0 comments1"

7,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Oct 2018Since you do not need the money and have no other alternatives in mind, I'd suggest leaving your investments as it is, in hopes that the market will recover soon or in the near future. But if you need the money, sell it off to cut your losses. 0 comments1"
8,"Eddie NgLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 13 Nov 2018As some pointed out correctly, this is not the right portfolio diversification. Your portfolio should consist of cash, bond, unit trust, equity, property and etc. At this current climate, best is to allocate a bigger portion to cash & bond. You can slowly reduce your equity holding by selling off stocks that have fundamentally moved to down trend. But again, it will be your call based on your fundamental analysis. Cutting loss is painful, but better than no fund to invest when the next bull cycle. 0 comments0"
9,"Dwivid SharmaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 Oct 2018Hi,You have a good portfolio of stocks. Most of the stocks have provided a good return over the long term as the previous performance. In this situation, I would like to suggest you go along with your investment. Consider your self as an investor, not a trader. Most of the stocks have huge potential to provide a good return over the time. Be calm !!! 0 comments0"
10,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Oct 2018It is not a good position to be at the moment. At the current market situation, it is better to relook at your portfolio. Ask yourself why you have bought the stocks in the first place and whether you believe the company will do well in the next 10 years. If you still believe in their potential, then keep it. Otherwise, it might be better to redeploy your capital into stocks which stands a better chance in the current market. 0 comments0"

14,"Jefremy JuariLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 Oct 2018Why are you still invested in stocks after the top gave way and already entering the bear market.
Give yourself a break, then take a look at short term investments, e.g. Quarterly investments at 3-5% or looking at income producing assets. Have some pity for your money burning in stocks. 0 comments0"
