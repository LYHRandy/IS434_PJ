MasterAnswered on 16 Jun 2019I would like to however add a more generic category like OTHERS to record any physical assets. It could be the stash of cash I received from my ang pao ($1 ringgit notes ðŸ˜‚) or property I've just purchased. Or maybe it's the one gold bar I found in the freezer. Who knows? Naturally these would be manually keyed and UOM would need to be flexible enough + descriptions available.0 comments1"
