You just need to find the right place which values your skill sets and you will be able to improve your earnings potential.
Having said that, it does depend on your income and expenditure. If we are looking at the 3 local banks, if you have a minimum salary of $2000, you can consider OCBC 360 as they do not impost any further criteria to earn the extra interest. If your salary is $2000, but you do put a bit of spend on a credit card, then the DBS multiplier will work if your salary plus your spending is $2000 (e.g., credit $1800, spend $300, that will unlock bonus interest). I don't recommend UOB one as the criteria are for you to spend $500 minimum on their cards, which may not be the case every month.If not, open a CIMB Fastsaver account and transfer funds there. You'll earn 1% with no criteria to be met.0 comments2"

Use it as a savings account (park your money)Create a DBS multiplier account , and credit your salary to it. Transfer the amount you want to save monthly to the SC account. Then use the DBS one as expenditure account. DBS also easier to find ATMs.0 comments1"
