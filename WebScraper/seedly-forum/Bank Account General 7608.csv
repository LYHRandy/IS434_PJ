2,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 17 Jul 2019Hey CS!â€‹Unfortunately for now, we do not have that feature to export out expenses for the Seedly app... You are only able to currently view the expenses all aggregated together on the 'transactions' tab in the app!â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹If you want to choose to do it manually, you can actually do it via a CSV download on your own banking website which you'll be able to manually aggregate them together. Hope that answers your questions :) if not, feel free to just ping the team at support@seedly.sg Cheers!1 comment0"
