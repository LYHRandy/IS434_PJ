God of WisdomAnswered on 25 May 2019Absolutely.Usually employee benefit plans end when you leave the company. This means voluntary or involuntary. Insurance is supposed to give you peace of mind and remove risks. Relying on a employer provided policy may keep you worried and leave you uninsured without you planning for it. It's always a good thing to have policies that you own as well.0 comments2"
