2,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Mar 2019This boils down to how you define Better since better in my opinion may not necessarily mean better in your opinion.Perhaps, take some time to understand yourself such as your risk appetite, knowledge, returns, as well as hunger to succeed.If you are willing to take on some risk, as well as willing to learn about stock investing, perhaps this would be a better choice for you.If you are willing to take on some risk, and would wish to be passive about your investment, you can consider Robo-advisors, ETFs, or speak to a financial advisor that can help you manage your funds.If you are conservative, and would prefer to be passive in your investments, an endowment plan/Fixed Deposit/ SSB may cater to your needs.Having said so, given your long horizon, I would assume that you are still young. Hence, do ensure that as you seek returns from saving up for retirement, you should also have adequate insurance coverage such as Health and Life Insurance.You may also speak to me via my weblink below: https://brandanchen.manulife.sg/0 comments0"
3,"Lim Wei Siang, Financial Consultant at Advisors Alliance Group - Aia FaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 08 Mar 2019You can consider talking to a finacial consultant. But do think through these factors:$30,000 - as a lump sum or divided into yearly contribution?What is your risk appetite?To save for retirement, how much do you have currently in your CPF account?When would you like to retire and how much do you think you need monthly when you retire?Other than $30,000, are you able to afford more if required? How much more?When you retire, do you want the returns to be in a form of an annuity or a lump sum payout or fine with either?0 comments0"
