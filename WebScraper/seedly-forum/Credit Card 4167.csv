1,"SWShaun Wq LimLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Typically it begins upon card activation or successful application, I believe. One way to avoid late fees and headaches wondering if you made payment for your credit card bill is... to call your credit card provider/bank to align the billing dates. For example, I have called AMEX to align the billing cycles of both my cards on the same day. Yes there will be some adjustments for a month or so until the cycles align.So be prepared to pay higher than usual credit card bills(as transactions will shift) during that period.2 comments1"
2,"Gordon Teo20 Apr 2019That's helpful! So that means I can align all my cards(diff banks) all together as well?SWShaun Wq Lim20 Apr 2019Yes, meaning you would have to call the banks individually to arrange for the billing cycle adjustment. 

However depending on your spending, it may cause a giant crater in your account, if you choose to pay all your credit card bills on the same day. ðŸ¤«ðŸ˜³"
