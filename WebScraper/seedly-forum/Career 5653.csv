question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Sep 2019Crossroads in career, any thoughts on a career switch to compliance in the late 30s?Been thinking about changing careers of late. An agent I worked with suggested I look into the area of compliance since it is a growing and hot industry now. Any thoughts on a career switch in the late 30s and if it is viable? Want to know about what sort of compliance pathways are available as well and perhaps an idea of remuneration for someone new to it.1 answerAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterAnswered on 05 Sep 2019Switching career is always a tough choice.I could be wrong but from what I know, switching career in the 40s is more tough as new employers are reluctant to hire anyone with no prior experience.Even if you are willing to start with low pay, it does not fit in their planning as they probably have a decent budget to hire someone with higher pay but the proper experience.So if you want to switch, late 30s is better NOW than never.=)PS: If you mean is compliance is a good career move, no idea what your current prospect is, but yes I heard of many guys in compliance with decent pay and great promotion prospects.
