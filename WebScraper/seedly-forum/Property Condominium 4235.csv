question,"Property Condominium Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Sep 2019Hi there! What are your thoughts on the private property market outlook for the latter of 2019 and going into 2020?I am thinking of buying a property for my own stay, but am not in any urgency to do so. I have heard from some sources outside of the real estate industry that the global economic situation is going downhill and property prices may dip but have also heard (mostly from estate agents and related reports) that prices are relatively low now and may in fact increase in the years to come, or stabilize. Just wanted to see if anyone has any insights to share? Thanks in advance :-)1 answerAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterUpdated on 05 Sep 2019There are more unsold units in new launches nowadays.You should google online, read up more, and do NOT take advice from property agents.Try asking a few barbers whether you need a haircut, what do you expect them to say?I believe the super premium property reached very low grounds in the past few years, so maybe not much to go down. For the mass market, I think the better the location, the less likely it will drop more in the next 2 years.So depends on the location that you are aiming for.If it's me, I will wait but I won't do nothing, I will continue to scout 99.co and property guru and ask around to see if there are some opportunities for a good property deal.(I got my commercial property at a good price because the owner is willing to let go if I can pay a big option fee immediately, he probably needs the cashflow)4 comments0"

Thanks for sharing your advice."
