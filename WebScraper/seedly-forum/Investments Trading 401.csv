1,"Wei ShengLevel 2. RookieAnswered 3w agoAs a SaxoTradeGo and a SaxoInvestor user, here are my observations:SaxoTraderGo - It's designed for traders to make informed trading decisions with a wide range of features to allow its users to analyze its spectrum of products more easily.SaxoInvestor - Its an easier interface designed for the average investor who wants access to securities that you would normally incorporate into your Investment strategies such as Stocks and ETFs.As both platforms can be accessed through the same login details provided by Saxo, it's up to the user to decide which platform is appropriate based on their long term Investment horizon, risk appetite, financial situation and whether they have the time to dedicate towards active trading.0 comments0"
