I personally advocate having individual policies, especially for CI as the group term policy expires by 70 and it is prohibitively expensive. If you are supporting your parents, individual term policy will be highly recommended too, as my stand is that although the group term insurance is cheap, we still have a small chance that the provider might discontinue or raise premiums. Also, there is an age limit for cost-effective coverage from SAF GTL (age 65), and the maximum cover is 1 mio. If you need more cover, you will need a personal policy. You will need to ensure at least enough funds left behind to support your parents till they are at least 95 with inflation built into the calculation (Singaporeans have longevity genes so better safe than sorry)If you are worried about income in the event you can't work, then we need to look at what can stop you from working, which is usually some form of disability or critical illness. Hence you will also need to consider disability income and CI cover to meet your needs. This largely depends on your income level and expenses, so I can't comment too much here due to lack of details.To support your parents, one way is top up their CPF SA/RA to allow them to get payouts (are they on CPF LIFE?) for life/till 80+. This is one of the safest forms of giving them an income stream with decent returns. Supplement it by ensuring that they have a shield plan at the minimum to account for hospitalization expenses. If they are still able to, enhance their long term care coverage, and in the same vein, see if you can top up their MA account to ensure that funds are available for their medical expenses/premiums. Given the details you have provided, I can only layout this basic framework for you, but I hope it helps for a start.Talk to an independent advisor to assess the options available to you.
