1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 08 Sep 2019Short answer, yes.Unless! That card excludes Grabpay top-up. Otherwise, to the bank, it is just another transaction and it will reward you the cashback.But if your card has a minimum spend per month, do ensure that you hit it or else your cashback will be reduced.1 comment1"
