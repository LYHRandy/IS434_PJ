Local companies still think that graduates with honours are better qualified (true or not, I am not certain)If you are planning to work where MNC and foreign companies are the main employers, congrats, honours mean nothing to them. Honours probably can get you the first job, after that, no decent company will even care abt your degree, they want to know your past work experience and what you have contributed to your past company and what you can contribute to them. Your degree, honours and other academic results are mostly not very relevant to most of such foreign companies.(I studied at NUS for 3 yrs, didn't know what I want to do, so did my honours. Turn out that my honours is not very useful for my career because, in the end, I decided to do my own business. I would have been better off starting my work life earlier. No regrets though, since hindsight is always 20/20)It would have been great if I had more internet back then. :)0 comments1"
