It is most easily hit with min 1.55% interest if your salary is $2K & above + credit card spend (given that there is no requirement for min. spending on credit card compare to the rest which encourages you to spend more to entitle higher tier interest)​You can refer to seedly blog with the comparison chart to see which of the savings A/C works better for you, given that everyone's spending nature differs:https://blog.seedly.sg/best-savings-accounts-2018/​To see if the DBS mutliper A/C works for you with higher interest compared to the rest, you can go to the below link and use the calculator to check what will be the interest rate you are eligible: https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/landing/dbs-multiplier/?cid=sg-dbs-vanity-others-dbs-multiplier2 comments1"

4,"Zi Song LimLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 10 Jun 2018you can try DBS Multiplier account or the OCBC 360, however, there are certain requirements to meet for you to get the most interest. If those are not feasible, you can explore CIMB Savings too, as they give 1% just for having the savings account with them.​read more here: https://blog.seedly.sg/best-savings-accounts-2018/​​0 comments0"
