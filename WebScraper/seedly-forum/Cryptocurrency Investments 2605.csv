1,Sean SimLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 28 Feb 2019Invest only if you fully understand the technology and how everything works . Invest in the technology long term don’t speculate and expect to gain returns in 1 month although this is entirely possible given how violate the crypto market. The fact that bitcoin can rise to 20k over a few months means people are obviously speculating because the intrinsic value is way lower than that . Invest don’t speculate . Hope this helps you0 comments0
