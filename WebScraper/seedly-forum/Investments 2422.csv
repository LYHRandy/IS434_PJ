MasterAnswered on 06 Mar 2019A market maker is an entity that buys and sells securities at prices it displays in an exchange’s trading system for its own account which are called principal trades and for customer accounts which are called agency trades. They play an imperative role on the exchange, enhancing the stock's liquidity so everyday small retail investors like ourselves can buy them.They must maintain continuous two-sided quotes (bid and ask) within a predefined spread. A market is created when the designated market maker quotes bids and offers over a period of time. They ensure there is a buyer for every sell order and a seller for every buy order at any time.0 comments1"
