1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Nov 2018Mmm what is your initial funding amount? If it's gonna be USD10k and above, Interactive Brokers may be your best bet. I believe they do charge for market data as well.Personally I use TD Ameritrade (for options only though). Straightforward platform with a very strong charting side. USD10.65 flat for stock transactions for retail customers, but you can try asking for better rates. I'm getting USD0.015, minimum $5 as part of a community perks. Hope this helps.0 comments0"
