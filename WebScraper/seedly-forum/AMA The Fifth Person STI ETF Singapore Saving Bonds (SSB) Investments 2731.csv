You can't compare the 2. You can't compare Fixed Deposit to Property, same here, you can't compare stocks to bonds. However, a balanced portfolio will need both stocks and bonds. The rule of thumb is to have your age as the % of your portfolio in bonds, the rest in stocks.So if you're 25 years old. A 75% Equity and 25% Bond portfolio would be ideal if you're planning for retirement.And for your equities, I'd diversify globally and wouldn't personally touch the Singapore stock market. 0 comments0"

If you need the money in a couple of years it maybe a better choice to invest in SSB, but if your goal is for the long term, STI maybe the better choice. This question will also depend on your risk appetite, STI has a larger risk as compared to SSB. There is no definite answer as to which is better, investing in a both is also not a bad choice. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019STI ETF will be more likely to have more returns as they are stocks but will be riskier and more volatile. SSBs are backed by government and low risk but lower returns. See your risk appetite, goals and so on to determine which suits you or you can just invest in both.0 comments0"
