Have an emergency fund of around 6 months expenses, insurances all done and then do your research which investment suits you the most. Dont follow the crowd, buy what you think is good based on ur research.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019It boils down to your preference mode of management; are you into daily monitoring, do you like to pick your own stocks, how much can you contribute and at what frequency. Personally I don't monitor on daily basis so robo adviser is a better option for me.That said, due diligence on your investment is still required. :)0 comments1"
