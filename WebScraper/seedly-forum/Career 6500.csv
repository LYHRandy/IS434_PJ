I am worried that I am unable to find a job that pays me as well and considering the fact that I will only complete my pt degree the end of next year. I tried applying for jobs related to my pt degree as it is sth I would like to do in the long run but I have not been shortlisted for any interviews despite applying for months.

RookieAnswered on 04 Mar 2019I suggest u wait until you get your degree in your hands then u start applying. fret not, i know people who have applied for more than 2 years before getting jobs, so just keep applying. :)Also, try to look at ur resume and see how u can modify it to suit the job u r looking for. Highlight traits and skills that reflect the job scope of the potential job so that recruiters can glance at one shot and can pick up the key words and u have a higher chance of being called up. :) hope this helps man0 comments1"
