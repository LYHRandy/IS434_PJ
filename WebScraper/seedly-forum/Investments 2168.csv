question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Mar 2019Should I purchase foreign currency corporate bonds?Hi all,Wish to get some advice regarding buying foreign currency bonds. I saw some USD corporate bonds on FSM which their coupon rates are quite attractive. One such example is BAC (Bank of America) 3.950% 21Apr2025 which gives 3.95% of coupon/yr but is in USD.Other than the usual FX risk, liquidity risk, default risk etc will it be advisable to purchase such bonds? SGD bonds are mostly wholesale and not open to small investors like us. I am more into fix income but not funds.1 answerAnswerBump0"
