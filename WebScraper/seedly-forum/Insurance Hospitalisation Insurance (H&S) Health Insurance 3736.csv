1,"Zen Rogue XuanLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 25 Jul 2019PA covers accidental death and TPD. PA plans payout based on an accident are usally capped around 5k, and are subjected to a deductible of $50 and upwards. Personally, I do not feel PA plans are necessary unless you work in a high risk environment. That being said, the best ""value for money"" PA plan on the market would be Sompo's PA Star. They usally have 20% off their PA plans, in the first quarter of the year.0 comments0"
