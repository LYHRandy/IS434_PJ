question,"P2P Lending Investments Stashaway Robo-Advisors Asked by Qingling WuAsked on 10 May 2019Just came across StashAway, sounds familiar but I am really not sure what is it. Is it another P2P platform? From the reviews it looks like a bank account that allows people to buy shares etc.? :o1 answerAnswerBump1"

1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Stashaway is not a P2P platform.Stashaway is a roboadvisor/robo investing platform.How it works is you create an online account with them. Get a basic risk and financial profiling. They recommend you a portfolio based on your risk profile. You decide how much you want to invest, and deposit the money. They do all the investing for you for a small fee.They don't buy individual company shares rather they invest in ETFs (exchange traded funds) which is a fund containing hundreds of companies and benchmarked against an index.4 comments1"
2,"See all 4 comments AWAdrian Wong10 May 2019Not to be quoted. But I think their performance is reasonable. I set on with a highest risk profile. Started September. During the trader war end of the year in December January market was bad and it went to -8%. From that the market bounced and I am at +6% up now. Itâ€™s better compared to MAPS with Fundsupermart which I think is human managed. MAPS goes no where to be honest. Waiting to pick up and move it to Stash.Qingling Wu13 May 2019Thanks Gabriel and Adrian, may I know what are the possible risks for this platform?"
