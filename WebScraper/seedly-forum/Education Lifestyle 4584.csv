God of WisdomAnswered on 18 Sep 2019I think education is pretty affordable if you're a Singaporean. Maybe it might be a little pricey for foreigners.30-50k for a 3-4 yr undergraduate degree is expected and I think universities in other developed countries would cost the same for their locals as well.0 comments4"

Keep in mind these fees vary for Singaporeans and international students, as with universities 'round the world.
