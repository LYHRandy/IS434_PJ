1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 May 2019There's two types of interest: simple and compound (a little more complex). The interest you have described is known as simple interest, known for it's negligible returns. Compound interest is different. What it does is that you will be given interest from your 'principal' then interest from your 'principal + interest' then interest from your 'interest + principal + interest' and so on...hence the term compounding. For banks, interests given are interest compounded monthly. That's why you receive some interest every month (instead of yearly).0 comments0"
