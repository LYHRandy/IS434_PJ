It is not a good idea to rely on them for short term goals which are paying your school fees and if BC means Bitcoin, it is even worse. Maybe get some part-time jobs while you are studying will be a better way. You don't have to avoid debts as well. Just plan properly on how to pay it all off when you finished your degree as soon as possible.3 comments0"

But still not recommended to rely on stocks for short term goals as they are better for long term goals unless you are good with day tradingQuestion Poster22 Sep 2019Ok ok, is there any scholarships you recommend? ðŸ¤£ thanks!"
