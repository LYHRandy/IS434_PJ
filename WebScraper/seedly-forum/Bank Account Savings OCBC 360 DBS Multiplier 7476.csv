That means out of your 60k, 35k is earning 1.2% and 25k is earning 1.5%, not all 1.5% when u have more than 35k. DBS multiplier gives bonus interest up to 50k so putting 10k into CIMB Fastsaver would be better or you can even consider SSBs. OCBC not that good right now in terms of interest.0 comments1"
