question,"General Bank Account Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Aug 2018Should I leave my money in UK bank or transfer back (at loss) to Singapore to invest?I've previously worked in UK and hence have some savings in a bank account over there. Came back during the 2008 recession and left my account open in the UK when the rate was 1: 2.4 thenShould I transfer the money here and use it for investments now (1:1.7)?Or should I just keep it there (earning approx. 1-1.5% interest P.A.) and wait for pound to rise?I'm currently not hard on cash, have sufficient EM Fund, some spare cash for investing. Just wondering if I should get even more cash on hand for investing.Alternatively, anyone knows if I can trade directly from UK using my UK account? Legally of course.1 answerAnswerBump1"

One good way will be to transfer it to a mutli-currency account (e.g. Multiplier acc) where you can have the GBP be deposit as a GBP wallet - and you can exchange it at a rate you desire. Do ntoe that you will not be receiving any interest for GBP in mutliplier account. 0 comments0
