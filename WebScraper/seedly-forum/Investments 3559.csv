2,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Definitely prefer to buy Individual REITS! Because I can actually pick and choose and do an analysis of the REITs I have shortlisted :) Based on both a Qualitative and Quantitative scoring. (eg market, management, gearing ratios, occupancy rate, past dividend histories etc) I personally buy into the Retail and Healthcare REITs space because I have studied these two markets and back-tested them as well.​Some basic definitions:A real estate investment trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate.A REIT ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is a collection of REITS which form up an index and is traded on the stock exchange.However, that being said, for beginners, espcially with the new ruling that they will not charge the 17% income tax on the fund itself, suddnenly the REIT ETFs become very viable for beginners who may not want to pick and choose but also participate in the higher dividend yielding asset class of REITs itself. ​That leaves the three main things to take note:​1) Fees - The Lion-Phillip S-REIT ETF has a management fee of 0.5%, the NikkoAM-Straits Trading Asia Ex Japan REIT ETF has a management fee of 0.5% and the Phillip SGX APAC Dividend Leaders REIT ETF has a management fee of 0.5%.​2) Management - Who are the fund managers behind the REIT ETF itself. Are they reputable folks?​3) Diversification - What REITs comprises of the ETF itself.0 comments1"
3,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I prefer individual reits because I do my own analysis and am confident enough that I can pick good reits.​However, if you lack the time or knowledge to pick reits then choose the reit etf. Returns are lower but you are more diversified.2 comments1"
4,Lim ChoonGuan14 Jun 2018Will you switch the REIT from time to time ?Gabriel Tham14 Jun 2018Depends on the situation. If the Reit has lost its attractiveness or its management starts to fail then yes I will switch. Or rather cut loss and buy into a better Reit
