4,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Oct 2018A good boss makes hell lot of differences.  He or she is going to determine whether you get the salary increment and promotion as well as cultivating a good work environment (cordial colleagues relationship) and culture (work life balance). But of course, that is provided you perform your job role as expected and work collaboratively with your team members. Ultimately, it takes two hands to clap. 0 comments1"

6,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Oct 2018Another important factor that I'd look out for is company culture. Having interned at a start-up during my 6 months internship stint, I truly enjoyed myself as the company's culture is very laid back with little/no hierarchy as I got to hang out with my CEO, manager and colleagues at a co-working space and over meals. But of course, we also worked hard when we were supposed to and had tons of fun otherwise. 0 comments1"

To me, if you are young 20s-30s, I would optimise all out for learning.interviewing people along the way, Iâ€™ve seen how some people who are age around the same, but have found a way to really learn so much in a short time, and usually it is a mixture of these:Who you learn from (mentor at work)Network (who you know)Learning opportunities at work (experiments and depth of experience)0 comments0"
