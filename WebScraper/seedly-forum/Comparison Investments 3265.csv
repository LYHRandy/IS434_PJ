1,"Lee JiahuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Oct 2018Capland is the property developer who buys the land, takes the loan, builds and get the first tenants. Usually after they secure decent occupancy of 90%, they sell it to their REIT to get money back so that they can repay the loan they took to buy the land and construct the mall. This is also known as ""capital recycling"". The REIT then takes a mortgage loan to pay the parent company. Parent usually holds on to 25% or any amount as major share holder in the REIT to benefit from recurring income from the malls. REIT raises money from retail investors via IPO or rights issue, or bank loans.0 comments1"

The rent goes to unit holders of the trust, which may include Capitaland Limited.
