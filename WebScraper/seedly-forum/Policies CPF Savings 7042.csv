Every country will definitely will need to have a pension plan, and Singapore's version is the CPF. Fun fact: We're ranked best in Asia as a pension plan and a B scale, shared with nations including Finland, Australia and Norway - is defined as ""a system that has a sound structure, with many good features, but has some areas for improvement that differentiates it from an A-grade system"".If this did not exist, it would mean that 'forced savings' would be taken out of the equation and thus, the onus falls on to the individual to save up for retirement post 55 years old when he/she is beyond his prime.Thus, more social welfare costs would be going up to cover for the necessities:Housing (CPF OA - Ordinary Account)Healthcare (CPF MA - Medisave Account)Daily expenses (shelter, food and water when you are out of the workforce)1 comment1"
