Both are difficult to do as it is before you even start investing. If you already have a job and are thinking of investing existing savings, as a beginner, start with ETFs. Until you learn enough to do high dividend stock-picking.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 26 Apr 2019Hi Qingling, if you don't require this money, you could park it in REITS to create an additional stream of passive income from the dividends that the issue, usually about 6-7%. This website provides very useful resources for REITs -- https://reitdata.com/However, the downside to REITs is that it usually runs inversely to the interest rate environment. When the economy is doing well, interest rates will rise (both loan and deposit), but given the nature of REITs whereby it is required pay out at least 90% of their taxable income to unitholders, approximately 30-40% of the entire business is funded on borrowed money from banks. Therefore this would affect the share price of the REIT.0 comments0"

Make sure you have your emergency cash set aside and your insurance planning done up.Today, there are so many products available for retail investors to choose from. If you're looking for a passive approach you should look at setting up a globally diversified portfolio that matches your risk profile.You can do this with online providers like Autowealth, Stashaway, EndowUs, MoneyOwl, just to name a few, or through a Financial Advisor like myself. It's important to keep costs low but also make sure you're paying for good advice. :)0 comments0"
