question,Investments Retirement Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Sep 2019Is it worth getting a remisier (Philips securities) to manage my investments?I’m not so keen on active buy/sell. More of a 'buy and let it grow' person. Quite keen on collecting lots of dividends ultimately. I’m thinking of letting the remisier handle 100k and mirroring the portfolio in another DIY platform with the remaining 400k. (I understand there won’t be exactly the same product/funds that is available on Philips platform.)Are the fees worth it? Assumption: 500k cash.?Hmmm...1 answerAnswerBump0

Sounds like you are an income investor at heart. At Phillip Securities, there are a number of portfolios/strategies that do involve the remisier/advisor taking a role in helping clients manage their portfolio. I would suggest that you can reach out to someone from Phillip to understand the options available, the strategies involved and their associated fees prior to making a final decision. If you do not know of anyone from Phillip, you can reach out to me.0 comments6"
