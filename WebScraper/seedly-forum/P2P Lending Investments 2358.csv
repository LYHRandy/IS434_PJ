1,"Getty Goh, Co-Founder & Exec Chairman at Coassets LtdLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 09 Mar 2019Hey there,I’m Getty and I’m the CEO of CoAssets - an ASX listed fintech company that offers online funding.You have asked a very good question. To add on to Kenneth’s post, there many types of corporate funding requirements. I have provided a simple table below to illustrate the various requirements and where alternative funding channels (for corporate debt) sit in the grand scheme of thingsWhile banks is a primary source of funding, there are other funding requirements that banks selectively serve. It is in these gaps where other types of financial institution (including alternative funding channels) serve.I hope this will give you a better idea on the types of businesses that would use the services of P2P platforms.0 comments3"

WizardAnswered on 03 Mar 2019These companies do P2P because of one of two issues.Either:they do not meet the requirements from the banks (not enough operating history or payment history)they need the money faster and the amounts may be not big enough to justify a bank loan0 comments1"
