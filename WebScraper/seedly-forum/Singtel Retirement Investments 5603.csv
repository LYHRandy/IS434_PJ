question,"Singtel Retirement Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Oct 2018Too big to fail? Just an example, like our local banks, singtel or ascendas reit. Since the probability is low, is it worth it to invest in these companies rather than a etf which has a lower yield?5 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Oct 2018I think the only one too big to fail might be Temasek holdings or GIC. If they fail we are really in deep S**T. DBS maybe....because it is the largest bank in SG and most of us deposit money there.0 comments3"

4,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Oct 2018I'll give an example. Hopefully it is enough. ​If you want to invest in Singapore Stock market, there is no choice, but through SGX. In other words, among the big companies that can't fail, SGX is the biggest of them all, right? If you just buy these ""infallible"" companies, well, you can be sure of a rude shock one day. Why? This is because you need to be aware of the value of the company famously summed as this investing quotes, Price is what you pay, value is what you get. ​Back in 2007, SGX was trading at over $15. I have checked on their website and there is no stock split, scrip dividends, etc. If you had bought that stocks back then, you would curse and swear as the share price is about $7 today. Even today, the dividends is about 28 cents. In 11 years, SGX has not gone back to $15. You suffered a paper loss of around $8, while the dividends are around half that amount at best. Next, if you had bought at $15, your dividend yield is at best, 1.86%, which is better left in the bank or SSB. This is not assuming there is no capital loss. ​Would you still have faith in such big, infallible companies, even if it is a 0.01% chance that it will fail? As such, whether it is worth to buy the individual stocks depends on your proficiency in stock picking. If you do not have the proficiency, then perhaps it is time to invest in a hobby/education in understanding how stock works. 0 comments1"

2. give maximun X percentage of your capital to them. if they really fail, you dont lose too much.
3. when the price drop 50%, you shouldnt sell out. (most difficult thing to do)0 comments1"
