MasterAnswered on 25 Sep 2018I honestly hate it when people answer this question irresponsibly.​Listen - if it meets your needs, it's the right policy. ​Is it a lot for a total of whole life and endowment plans? Not necessarily. If your goals were to get covered for a certain amount, and you are trying to save a certain amount in future - if you've gotten it done, then its a good thing.​Are there more efficient ways of achieving these goals? Possibly. It depends how good your advisor is, because there's a ton of instruments that you can mix and match and many things depend on the kind of person you are. ​But with so little information available, all I can do is warn you that cancelling will cause you to lose your money AND your insurance. Again. ​It is possible to mathematically review if this loss is acceptable. I have done it for a 40 year old client. But I generally can't encourage people to cancel their policy because I have to take responsibility for it. ​Please ask people who have to be responsible if you carry out money-losing actions, not randoms online. ​​0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 25 Sep 2018I agree with Luke Ho.​I personally have a 50k coverage Whole life plan with CI bought at age 21, compare to Mindef Aviva Insurance.​I have done my own studies on the IRR required to hit the death benefit. (ceveat, its for myself... so please do your due diligence)​The breakeven point for retirement is at Age 67-82. Thereafter, it make sense for to draw by age 92.For your own, you need to check upon yourself how this will affect the calculation.0 comments0"

4,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Sep 2018That really depends what you are covered for (death, TPD, CI, ECI)  and the amount of coverage (large or small). Whole life is more expensive than term life but there is cash value when you surrender the policy in the future. Perhaps you need to determine what are your needs before deciding whether to retain or to cancel.0 comments0"
