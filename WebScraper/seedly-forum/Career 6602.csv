GeniusUpdated on 16 Nov 2018Hi, I'm doing my Bachelors of Engineering in Software Engineering at Singapore Institute of Technology.Try FreeCodeCamp, YouTube tutorials on using content management systems like Wordpress.If you're highly skilled in these areas, such as doing digital marketing, website design, SEO, there are companies and people out there that are willing to pay you good money for it. I'm talking like taking up an account for $2k monthly.So imagine you work with 3 clients as a free lancer or you operate your own digital marketing agency, you're already raking in $6k monthly.So ask yourself this, which part of computer science do you want to dive into? Front end development? Back end development? Mobile application development?Computer science is broad. Define what exactly you're passionate about first, before making a decision.0 comments0"
