In fact, looking at the figures posted from your WL policies, you may still be under insured.I suggest to cover your insurance gaps with the group term life and add on the Living care rider for CI cover, you may want to look at private term policies as well if you want ECI coverage.Based on your annual income, you should have a total of about 330k as coverage in the event of death if you have dependents and 150k in the event of CI.7 comments2"

Death coverage only increase after age 65, so doesn't matter when you get it."
