WizardAnswered on 17 Feb 2019I actually went to Okinawa last week... for 7D6N over the CNY period :)It's actually not too bad a place to go, depending on season of course... perfect for summer weather. Place filled with history and many places to drive around the island :) people there are pretty happy. And okinawa soba is really good.Anyway if you really want to cancel your tickets... i think the only way is to list it on Carousell or ask friends if they may be keen.Then sell your ticket price at: Total price - change name fee (depending on which airline) If you are flying JETSTAR  most likely as a direct flight to Okinawa... then...Looking at this: https://www.jetstar.com/sg/en/help/articles/fees-and-chargesThe Change name fee is $60 per ticket. Hope this helps :) I would think Okinawa is really not bad to go actually... i can send you my itenary. a good mix of nature and shopping also (big malls there and outlet mall not bad)0 comments1"
