1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 24 Mar 2019Look at recession resistant sectors such as:Healthcare: Whether or not the economy is booming or in a downturn, people (unfortunately) still get sick and will demand healthcare services accordingly. This could be anything from your regular GP visits to the expensive but required surgeries, as well as constant medication. Also think about big pharma, who makes vital cancer/chronic disease drugs that people cannot go without.Consumer staples (and especially grocery): In a downturn, people are more likely to dine out less (no-frills), and cook more at home. When we dine outside, we are after all paying a premium for brand/service/ambience/staff costs etc. Discount retailers: People might still want to shop, and could turn to discount retailers instead especially when budgets are tighter.0 comments3"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Mar 2019You can think about rotating into defensive sectors such as Healthcare, Consumer Staples and Ultilities, because these sectors serve basic human necessities that will not diminish by much even in the event of recessions. people still fall ill, people still need to eat, people still need electricity, heating (for us it's the irreplacable aircon, for those that can't sleep without it). Defensive sectors have low beta, meaning they are not sensitive to the movements of the market. Keeping your money and not investing may sound like a good idea, but what happens in recessions is that you are leaving your money to sit there and get eaten away by inflation. and when will recession occur? who knows. You may have to wait another 1 or 2 years before it happens. If you truly are afraid of possible capital gain losses - invest in some of the strongest bonds in the world, right here in Singapore - your SSBs/ SGSs. They will at least beat out inflation by a little, and still provide you with regular income in the case that you get retrenched. In the chinese saying, "" nobody despises having more money""!0 comments2"

I think some areas to consider invsting in during a recession would be to invest in core sector stocks, core sectors are usually sectors whereby people will still spend their money on during a recession. Such sectors include healthcare, utilities and consumer goods sectors. Another area of investment that you can look into would be precious metals such as gold or silver as they tend to perform better during market slowdowns.0 comments1"

I'm not sure why you think there is an impending recession - if it is related to US yield curve inversion, its a pretty big bet to invest based on that assumption. But lets say you do know the future and a recession is coming.Think of what happens in a recession, and think about your objective during the recession.  While the exact strategy would also depend on the nature of the recession (is it runaway inflation, stagflation, depression etc), there are certain things you can do:You can start to rotate into long duration Treasury now, because when the recession starts, people will flee to safety.Gold has sometimes been one of the safe havens - usually a knee-jerk haven though.Cash is alway king - but not in a bank account. You might want to take short term bonds.4.Some people go to 'defensive' sectors like healthcare/utilities. That could work for you, but it depends on the nature of the recession and the timing. Lastly, remember that no one is immune to a recession. before thinking of your investments, think about how your earning/job will be affected, and then think of your investments in that context. If you are a salesperson whose commissions depend on selling a luxury item, you might need to think of the impact on your income as well - because less people will be buying your products..0 comments1"
5,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 25 Mar 2019One simple way to think about is what are the things you still need in a recession?Healthcare: Recession or no recession, if you fall sick, you still need see doctor or go hospital.Consumer staples: Things like your groceries, snacks, food, toiletries, etc. Recession or not you need still your toothpaste, shampoo, groceries, milo, kopi etcUtilities such as power, water: Recession or not you are not going to start using candles at home....and i doubt you will give up a good shower too.0 comments1"
6,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Mar 2019Some sectors that thrive on recession are consumer staples and commodities. Consumer staples are typicall the last products that a household removes from its budgets, therefore making it one of the safest. As economies slow, demand slows and commoditiy prices tend to drop. If investors believe a recession is coming, they'll often sell commodities, which drives prices lower. However once the economy moves into recovery phase, the growing economy would need inputs including natural resources. These needs grow as economic output grows, therefore pushing up the prices for such resources.0 comments1"
