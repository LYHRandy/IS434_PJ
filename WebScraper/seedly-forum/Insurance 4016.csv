question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 01 Nov 2018With a parent diagnosed with cancer decades back and in remission now, which shield plans should I be looking at?I'm in my early 20s and just starting to learn about all the shield plans. I have a family history, and people are saying that I may get rejected in my application. With cancer in my family history, I'm looking at plans with longer pre/post hospitalization, but I'm not familiar with underwriting etc. Which companies are better?5 answersAnswerBump0"

Only for life insurance plans would you have a chance of being loaded (asked to pay higher premiums).Seedly has an article or two on the best Shield Plans on the market but the 2 plans I usually look at would be AIA and AXA's. And only Aviva for their moratorium underwriting if applicant has slight health issues that doesn't affect their daily life. 0 comments1"

It would be kind of outrageous if you think about it. If you're looking at longer post hospitalization, most companies are beginning to offer 360 or 365 days now - AXA, AIA, Aviva...in particular, AXA has private post hospitalization that is fully subsized. I'm from an FA and I do not offer AXA. Bleah. I think Aviva would be better if you have underwriting concerns.Hope that helps. 0 comments1"

Like what the other FAs suggested, go for plans with longer pre and post hospitalisation, e.g. Aviva, AXA, AIA. It is quite unlikely that you will be rejected at this stage. If you have some minor health issues, it would be good that you consider getting it from Aviva due to moratorium underwriting. And please do get it soon because Aviva is phasing out this option after 2018.Also, do get yourself covered with a plan that covers early critical illness and its better to get it as soon as you can!If you would like to know more, feel free to drop me a PM on www.facebook.com/brandan.chen or drop me an email at brandan.chen@manulife.com.sg0 comments0"

GeniusUpdated on 19 Nov 2018For medical underwriting concerns (depending on individual insurer), if there is just one person with cancer (except breast), age of diagnosis over 50 , it will usually be a standard case for u. Coverage wise all the companies are about the same. There are only very minor benefits differences.Note Do not take Moratorium underwriting if u do not have any health issues.If u want to learn more about hospitalisation claim processes, and or discuss more in details about the shieldplan, can add me on my facebook.0 comments0"
