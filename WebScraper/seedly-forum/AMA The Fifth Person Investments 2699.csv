2,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Feb 2019There is no better or worse between the two. Just different methods, strategies and mindsets.Fundamental analysis revolves around looking at the company's financials, business, moats, long term prospects.Technical analysis is more into the price action of a stock, using indicators, figuring out market psychology. Does not care what company it is, as long as there is price, a chart, you can use technical analysis.Both are suitable for beginners to experts. You have to find out what is your mindset. Try learning both, and see which one suits you as an investor or trader, and also determine your own risk profile.Even within each type of analysis there are many many ways of analysis. These are just the broad categories. 0 comments1"

Technical analysis (TA) require to look at charts and it can be quite taxing as compared to fundamental analysis. If you feel emotion everytime the share price move south then probably TA may not be suitable for you. 0 comments0"
4,"Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Like the others have mentioned here, there probably isn't a better answer, but it would be dependent on several factors. Here are just a few that you can think of.What fits your skill set better, or what are you more familiar with?Others have already defined the differences between the 2 forms of investing here, and it would really be dependent on what suits you best. I would say, learn both forms of analysis first, and see what plays more to your strengths. You can also try to observe which forms of analysis leads you in making smarter investment decisions. You can do this by trying out investment simulators, or simply hypothetically make investment decisions and see what kind of hypothetical results you will get over timeWhat kind of asset classes / investments are you looking at?Different asset classes may require different approaches to monitoring their investments. Before you choose what approach you want to adopt, look at what kind of asset classes and risk and returns you prefer.You should probably have a feel of both technical and fundamental analysis at the end of the dayThere is no right or wrong here, but both approaches can lend you different perspectives, and in your investment journey, that would be quite helpful. Hence, it would be good if you choose one over aonther, but then have the other form of approach as a backup or a check on your investment decisions.0 comments0"
5,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019There is no better or worse. They are tools to validate the price action and value of the company.Fundamentals just means looking at the whole company financial health (like how you do a review for your own health). It's meant to help you find out the company financial stand. Hence people look at the various indicators. 
1) Price to Book
2) Price to equity
3) Net Asset Value
4) Income and expenses, and those related to operational like free cashflow etc.
Investmentmoat (By Kyith Ng) is really a great resource for such analysis. He really goes in depth to understand a company.Technical Analysis is just judging based on the chart, price action, volume, support and resistance, etc to gauge the sentiments of the market. It shows you consolidation (people buying or selling a stock currently), possible breakout or sell down (especially when Consolidation occurs). EtcIf you are able to combine the two, you will likely get a better price than just relying on FA. Though, the basis for your price should be on FA, and TA is just used to see when is a better time after you have done your FA. 0 comments0"
