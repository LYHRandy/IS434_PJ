Grand MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019If I want lifestyle, i prefer condo.If I want financial prudent, then 1)  HDB = the monthly maintanence fee for condo is way higher than HDB.2) if you are newly wed, HDB allows you extra subsidies, $40,000 for example. None for condo3) The extra money for Condo will attract extra interests you have to pay over the years = another extra costs0 comments0"
3,"Nicholas Woon, Marketing Director at ERA Realty Network Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Oct 2018I would go for condo! Price of resale HDB is stagnant and somewhat on a downward trend. It doesnt look like it will increase anytime soon with the huge supply of BTOs. Condo has much more room for capital appreciation!0 comments0"

5,"Raina LimLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 24 Oct 2018It depends on your exit strategy. After X years of stay, what are the chances of selling the resale HDB for ($1mil + bank interest + CPF interest); similar for the condo. Do keep in mind that HDB is not exactly a free market anymore as HDB valuation is no longer done by private valuers but by HDB inhouse valuers. A property is usually a person's biggest investment (and liability), hence do look at the future returns before locking in.:)0 comments0"
6,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 May 2018Assuming both equally good location, and assuming financially you can afford both with no issues. Then I would personally prefer condo over resale.​Why? Because if you can afford condo, the potential for en bloc is higher. Price appreciation is also better. Condo also commands higher rental if you can find the right tenants.​And condo facilities are good for personal enjoyment!! (at a higher cost though, because condo fees more ex than HDB conservency fees)0 comments0"
