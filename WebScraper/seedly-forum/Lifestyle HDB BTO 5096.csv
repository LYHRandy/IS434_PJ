1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019No. 25 is just nice.  Wait 2.5 years for BTO, takes 10 months to conceive. ​I thought the new way of propose is "" Ai stead mai"" to become steady bf/gf and then the old ways of ""Ai BTO Mai?"" 😜​For many examples of people in Seedly FB and my own friends circle where they paid deposit for BTO but yet to get marry but later broke off for whatever reason , the lost of deposit and heart pain is more messy to deal with.  Thus suggest that you plan wedding , get ROM , then stay together either at one of the family home or rent a room , then only apply for BTO to be safe. Unless you're absolutely sure about each other and the wait for BTO of 2.5 years is gonna continue to improve , be closer and steady.​Not to mentioned you  both need to save up and pace up the cost of wedding and cost of getting BTO, Renovation etc. ​All the best 😄👍2 comments0"

1) Propose and save for wedding (skip expensive proposal ring to save $)
2) Wedding ROM and stay in either's family house first or rent a room.
3) Apply BTO and save $ while waiting for 2.5 years BTO comes (neck long long liao)
4) BTO reno
