God of WisdomAnswered on 19 Oct 2018It's just a wrapper for purchasing Unit Trusts.You can do so without getting an ILP and purchasing a Managed Portfolio from an FA or a Robo Advisor which provides full liquidity and lower costs of investing. However, when preparing for retirement, do take not you want to have some of your income to be guaranteed and some to be variable. Retirement planning is not just buying a product. You should speak to an FA or a trusted advisor for that. 0 comments0"
