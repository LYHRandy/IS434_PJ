1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Apr 2019Hello! The Saudi Aramco bond allow investors to invest in the Saudi economy without taking on any additional political or governance risk. Apart from a strong credit rating from Moody (A1 issue rating), Aramco has minimal debt relative to cash flow, large scale of production, market leadership and access to world's largest hydrocarbon reserves. As such investors view the Saudi Aramco bond as a safe bet at an attractive price. Aramco alone contributes to 45% of Saudi Arabia's GDP, 90% of country's export revenue and 80% budget revenue. Saudi Aramco is one of the largest oil exploring and producing companies in the world. It is nearly as big as Venezuela's oil reserves as a whole, bigger than Canada's oil reserves and several times larger than its global corporate competitors such as BP, ExxonMobil, PetroChina and Rosneft. TLDR: The bonds are a low risk way to get exposure.0 comments3"
