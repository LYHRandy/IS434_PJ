GeniusAnswered on 19 May 2018Hey,​Seedly has published an article on this:​Cheat Sheet: Best Savings Accounts in Singapore for Working Adults ​DBS Multiplier seems to give the highest realistic interest. But also, to each their own, different individual has their own spending habits. This calculator can help you find out the best savings account. Simply type in you basic information such as monthly spend, salary credit, insurance spend etc. and it will generate the best account for you.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 16 May 2018I like this post by Heartland Boy on highest interest savings accounts which should give you some good information as per which one you could pick, but I wouldn't recommend any specific bank given that you're still at the early stage of your 'working adult' life. Thus, any thing is good among the 3 main banks. Also, take note the author's angle with respect to maximising interest rates in your bank accounts. ​I personally use OCBC 360. ​0 comments0"
