1,"A.JLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yes they do. Even if they dress plainly with one or two jewels (which is not obviously high quality diamonds for untrained eyes), you can tell from the way they talk and walk. I recognize the 'small' ring wore by the lady is worth at least 1 million. Totally Astrid Leong eh? ​I know one couple (in good term with the husband, barely see and talk to the wife). The crazy rich actually the wife's family (similar to Astring Leong - Michael Teo story), but I suspect the initial wealthiness' gap between them is not too big. Wife's family own few hospitals in Singapore. I'm not sure what else they owns, but pretty sure much more than that, looking at the extravagant life and endless parties.  ​Grandma Shang Shu Yi is very friendly compared to grandma of this family. The real empress. Haha. 1 comment1"

MasterAnswered on 29 Aug 2018I don't know about Crazy Rich Asians, but I do know many crazy asians, aka mother-in-law (not mine), girlfriend when she is hungry... ​Jokes aside, I don't think many of us would know any of them, they probably have their own society and keep within their circles. I heard that they are quite wary of anyone not in their circle because the motivation for relationship with them can always be money.​I did know a classmate in school who lived in Sentosa cove, and I think had more than 1 property there. She was really very nice and never flaunted her wealth though. Who knows, there might be some of them hidden amongst you! ​But if you do find out that one of your friends is a ""crazy rich asian"" just treat them like you always do, I'm sure they'll appreciate it!0 comments0"
