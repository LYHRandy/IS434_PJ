1,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Oct 2018You invest a sum of money that generates interest. Instead of spending the interest, you reinvest it by buying more of the original investment. The next year both the original investment and the reinvested interest will earn interest, which you again reinvest. Compounding is like a snowball effect where your original investment will grow to a larger amount.0 comments0"
2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Compounding gives an ""added on/exponential"" effect.Let's say you have $10,000 in an investment with 5% simple interest. Interest earned will be (10,000 *5% = $500) in 1 year. Compared to a similar investment with 5% but compounded monthly. Interest earned will be (10,000{(1+5%/12)^12 -1}) = $511.62 in 1 year. Of course, the effects will be much exagerated over long period of time.5 comments0"

Consumes takes loan from banks and banks earn from the interest generated from the loans. Banks also profit from investments they make elsewhere. These profits allow banks to provide interest. Money was transferred from the borrowers and investments.Question Poster31 Oct 2018Okay I see, thanks!"
