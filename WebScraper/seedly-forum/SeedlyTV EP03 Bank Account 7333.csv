1,"Jessica ChuahLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 14 Aug 2019I'm using UOB One Account as my joint account. Instead of fulfilling the salary criteria, what my fiance and I did was to fulfill the credit card requirement and in future the 3 GIRO payment requirement when we move into our new place. For us this account worked best as we needed the cheque book and we were still able to maintain our regular salary crediting accounts separately.
The main downside of this arrangement is that the principal account holder will not be able to open another UOB One account under his/her name, so do take note on that.0 comments0"
