question,"Robo-Advisors STI ETF Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Mar 2019I have a lump sum of >$10000 I am about to invest in the STI, but after reading all of the posts on Seedly advising otherwise I'm a little confused. So this brings up 2 questions:Hariz, Luke and a couple others recommend a ""globally diversified portfolio"" instead of the STI - what does this mean practically, and how does one start in them? What are After the lump sum I have $600 monthly to DCA. Is this too small a sum to DCA into a global fund or ETF? If so, what minimum amount is recommended? What low-fee brokers are recommended? Any RSPs? B/G: I'm already invested in the STI, ABF, SSB and 5 local blue chips. Thanks for reading!4 answersAnswerBump2"

2,"Question Poster21 Mar 2019Thanks! I already have a lump sum in StashAway from 2 years ago and want to start investing directly in indexes. What are the advisable platforms/brokerages to use for buying global ETFs? I may look into mutual funds later this year when I come into inheritance money. At the moment I figure I need to start on global index investing.Hariz Arthur Maloy21 Mar 2019I'm not personally a user, because I'm not a big fan of index hugging. But you can access them using Interactive Brokers."

WonderkidAnswered on 20 Mar 2019The STI comprises the largest 30 companies listed on Singapore exchange, whereas a globally diversified ETF has broad exposure to a wide range of global companies around the world. For example, IWDA ETF has exposures in 23 developed countries, including Singapore with the weight of 0.5%.The biggest difference is the diversification. STI gives you exposures to Singapore listed companies, so if you only own STI the performance will be strongly linked to Singaporeâ€™s economy and stock market performance. A globally diversified ETF will give you a more balanced exposures across countries. To access global ETF you can either use 1) Local brokerage that provide access to foreign exchanges;
2) international brokerage account e.g. Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, Saxo Bank; 3) Robo-advisors such as StashAway.Different accounts have different charges.Size of investments depends on the account, as some account has minimum fixed monthly fee so it doesnâ€™t make sense to invest small amount of money. This is a broader topic on asset allocation which will involves your personal risk appetite and personal finance.0 comments2"
4,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Mar 2019It really depends how long you have to stay invested, so I'm going to give advice off the assumption you have a time horizon of at least 10 years.
1) A globally diversified portfolio means you're investing in economies around the world. So US, India, China, for example. You can start with a lump sum investment, or break it into smaller parts similar to DCA to manage your risk.
Global indices are not too difficult for me to beat, so you could always let me know if Hariz or myself can drop you a message, but otherwise you can always look up the IWDA ETF, for example, which is quite accessible.
2) A sum is only small depending on your needs. If someone is trying to get $10,000 in passive income by 10 years, they need at least $2mil if the passive interest is 6%, of which they should invest quite a bit more than $600/mth. I think you should just invest after ensuring that your cash flow is sustainable. You don't want to compromise your regular investment. Tie it to a goal, so that market drops do not make you deterred easily.I cannot recommend a low-fee broker because I am a high-fee Financial Consultant. If you want higher returns, you have to pay me. The most I can do personally is a non-wrap iFast, FAME or Philip account of which I would have no responsibility for how your portfolio goes after some initial recommendations.
That's generally how I do things as a professional. I do think fairly well of things like FSM, SGX and DollarDex. Just be mindful and don't trade.Since you have quite a bit of Singapore investments already, point 1 remains even more relevant. Do drop me a message if you'd like to see what I have to offer. Otherwise, just follow the advice above and get clarification from others who are more into a low cost, low yielding strategy. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 21 Mar 2019Globally diversified means you have investments in other countries apart from Singapore, namely mature markets (e.g. US, Europe), and emerging markets (e.g. the BRIC countries), such as by buying into stocks/ETFs etc listed in overseas markets.$600 monthly DCA seems decent, it is ultimately up to your comfort level.0 comments0"
