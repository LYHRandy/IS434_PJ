1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 08 Apr 2019Seems difficult to time. How long will you short it for? Most trends don't last more than a couple of days.Its been 3 weeks since you posted this answer. Hardly anyone's talking about it. Nike got slammed for its ad but its stock recovered quickly. Same goes for Gilette.Don't bother trying to time it unless you're an experienced options trader. Stay invested.0 comments0"
