question,"Credit Card DBS Live Fresh Card Asked by Huang YixuanAsked on 24 Jun 2019Do you guys face issues with DBS Live Fresh not giving out cashback for some months?I realise that on alternate months I only receive very little, like $0.19 or $0.34 for my Visa Paywave/ Online expenses when I definitely hit a few hundreds per category. When I do receive the monthly cashback it's usually maxed out at $20 for each category. I spend about $1000 every month on this card. Do you guys face this too?1 answerAnswerBump0"
