1,"Jessica Ann LeeLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 06 Sep 2019I won't buy travel insurance from the bank unless I know my personal banker is really going to stay there for quite a long time.(but then again, insurance advisers seems to jump ship here and there frequently)I had a read of this blog review on travel insurance and claims and approached them to buy a yearly plan.I met with a small accident in one of my trips, and thankfully the broker helped me with all the claims very professionally. Not like my previous bank who sent me an URL and wants me to fill in everything on my own.....And no banker at that time wants to help me because my previous banker just jumped to another bank.Hope that helps.3 comments2"
