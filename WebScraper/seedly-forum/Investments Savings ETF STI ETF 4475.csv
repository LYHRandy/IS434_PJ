1,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Sep 2019Diversify? NIKKO AM STI ETF’s exposure is Singapore. I would think it would be a good idea if you can set aside another sum to do StashAway since it has exposure to the US and Europe markets. Or money is an issue, maybe you can halve or set aside from the money you’re investing in STI ETF to go into StashAway? Maybe 50%? Or even 80% if you are able to take more risks.0 comments0"

FreshieAnswered on 09 Sep 2019If your monthly RSP to Nikko AM STI ETF is only S$ 100, would suggest you keep it (especially if you are having DBS Multiplier account and investment is one of the criteria to earn higher interest rate). You may do a monthly contribution to StashAway (no amount of investment is too small) as well to get exposure to the global portfolio, diversifying your portfolio across different regions is always a better choice than putting all into one basket. I have 3 different risk portfolios in StashAway and currently, 14% is the best (for 6 months continuously).My two cents :D0 comments0"
