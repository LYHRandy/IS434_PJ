1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 Mar 2019Update: Was reading about this online and some people were sharing the sentiment that this could be an orchestrated mistake by a trader/group done in high volumes at short intervals. For what gain would they get out this? My guess is the headline generated and interest piqued for Zoom's IPO.Honestly, I myself wouldn't have known about this company if not for this. As I myself follow the startup scene quite abit, finding out about Zoom made me research more behind what this company exactly does and their growth story leading to its IPO. I was actually quite curious how their video conferencing software doing so well against all the conventional nodes we are familar with(skype, googlehangouts, facetime).The numbers behind their growth was pretty insane. Sequoia publically declaring they joined one of the later investing rounds purely based off their growth. That really drove it home for me given how reputable Sequoia are as a VC to openly state that. As with many other unicorns- they have a good product, good marketing strategy, and when these translate into positive growth numbers (and at this rate), every investor wants to come aboard.Sincerely not doing publicity for them, but I do think they are worth a read. For those keen on investing, I urge you to read into their Prospectus(released about a week ago).https://www.drift.com/blog/how-zoom-grew/0 comments0"
