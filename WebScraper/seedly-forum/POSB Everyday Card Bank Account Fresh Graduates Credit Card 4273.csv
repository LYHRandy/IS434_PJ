question,"POSB Everyday Card Bank Account Fresh Graduates Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 24 Oct 2018Does POSB Everyday Card have a minimum spending / any catch I should be aware of?Hi, saw on some topics that POSB Everyday Card doesn't require you to hit a minimum spend. However, saw on https://www.valuechampion.sg/posb-everyday-card-review that it has a $700 minimum spend. A bit confused, and went to check their website but there's no clear information. Can anyone advise on the question in my topic title?1 answerAnswerBump0"

It will be in terms of Daily$ which you will need to manually redeem to offset your credit card balance.0 comments1
