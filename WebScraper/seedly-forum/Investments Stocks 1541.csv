1,"TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Well, I feel that this question is phrased inappropriately. (Or perhaps i misunderstood your question)I feel that if that person has no concept of saving money in the first place he wont have enough funds to invest. Well, its true that investing doesnt requires large amount of funds or savings (using RSP/DCA), I feel that its more important to allow the person to understand the importance of saving first (emergency funds, saving for goals/milestones).After he/she understand the importance of saving, only then he/she could look into investing his SPARE cash/funds to generate higher returns.The rule of thumb from most forums or blog is always 50 30 20, 50% of income for expenses, 30% for savings, 20% for investing. Do note that there's risks in investing and it usually requires commitment. I wont recommend someone to invest without having enough savings to fall back on. My motto for investing is always ""I'm prepared to lose 100% of my investments incase theres a financial crisis""1 comment2"

3,"Mel Tan WmLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do u want to cry that you have no money when u start to prepare for retirement? For myself, I am trying to earn more when I can, so I can start my investments. At 28, I do consider myself late if i were to start investing in my 30s. So yes, if you want to invest, make sure u have capital first, which is done either by saving up or creating more cashflow. Both steps, saving and investment will ensure that you would be safe when you retire, and that you dont have to rely on people or the govt to help you cross your silver years.3 comments1"

5,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 22 Apr 2019By walking the talk instead of talking the talk. Show results. Why would anyone listen to you just because it is fundamentall sound? Lots of “experts” are out there, and you are likely to be viewed as one, even though you may have the substance. If you have invested, and are quite good at it, (minimally decent at getting slightly above inflation rate of returns), you can show them that it is possible to invest and get good returns. The other reason you can sure is why you invest. Is it for a house? A wedding dinner? An early retirement? Another way would be say, use only a portion of your returns (say 20%) to treat them to a meal. Tell them your investment returns paid for this meal and if you can afford treat yourself to a nicer restaurant for the rest of your life, and you don’t have to slog for it. Chances are, they will light up their eyes and see the short term tangible impact of investing.0 comments0"
6,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 22 Apr 2019These are two separate but related concepts. Savings is the first step before investing can happen. If this person isn't currently saving any money, but wants to invest, then it is a clear argument. He/she would need his/her own capital to invest. If this person is not saving any money, and doesn't want to invest as well, then it's probably going to take a greater amount of effort to get them to do so. This is where you bring in the concepts of the importance of having emergency funds/what should be done to fight against inflation/what his or her long term financial plans are.0 comments0"
