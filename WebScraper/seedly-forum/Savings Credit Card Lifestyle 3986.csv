1,"Gabriel LimLevel 1. FreshieUpdated on 12 Sep 2019Nope. Not worth your money. Was stupid, got the annual plan. Worst waste of money in my life. Like literally flushing your money down the toilet2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster12 Sep 2019Oh got it... not alot of options available?Gabriel Lim12 Sep 2019Yes. Mostly unknown small eateries trying to promote themselves. They few big names they have, such as Harry's, you're limited to high priced low volume items such as a beer cocktail. (19++). Taste kinda nasty. Same goes for most outlets, you're limited to items not really moving. Very few places allow you to actually get a proper main for their one for one."

5,"Huang YixuanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Dec 2018I think Burpple beyond does not have as many options as entertainer, and for good restaurants (like the atas kind) the 1 for 1 is usually for something that is not the restaurant's speciality or not as expensive. So Entertainer could be more worth but the cons is that they lock you in for one year, while burpple you can just subscribe for the month you are bringing someone out and a lower cost!0 comments0"
