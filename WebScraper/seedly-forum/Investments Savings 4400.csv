God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoIf you have a horizon of at least 25 years, you can consider growing your funds via investments through a multi-asset portfolio of stocks, UTs, ETFs and bonds. However should you need your funds at a specific point in time, we will not know if the market is in a bull or bear phase during that point. Hence to hedge risk, you must either take the profit off the table when opportunities present themselves and lock them in safer instruments or allocation a portion of your investment budget to a very safe or even guaranteed asset class, to minimize your downside risk.Also, your CPF is also a method of funding your downpayment for the house. This will, however, be limited to a number of factors such as your salary (and by extension, your OA contribution). Thus, there is a limit to how much your OA funds can grow to, but on the bright side, the return is pretty much guaranteed.Consider the asset classes at your disposal, the goal will be to achieve a blend of the asset classes that will achieve a reasonable return with lower volatility and risk.0 comments3"
