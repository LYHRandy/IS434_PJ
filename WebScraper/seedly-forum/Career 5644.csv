1,"Jessica Ann LeeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 29 Aug 2019I will always choose passion over income.Passion means your life is a bit more exciting.Do note that at your age, your idea of what sector/topic/degree/demand may be different from reality though.For example, I thought Business degree is useful, fun and full of interesting people. After finishing my studies, I found that business is not as fun as I thought. Really different perspective after entering it.0 comments5"
2,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Sep 2019Can go networking session, go talk to those already working in IT and business, see what's their day to day is like. If you can intern for it might be even better to get some feels on how is it like.
Most of the time, what we study and expect the situation is at work is different. If you could intern for some of it, then the experience on working at the job would give you a sense of day to day light. What I'm trying to say is that, even study in Business is what you may prefer for, but the work might or might not be what you like. Same for IT.Finally, I would choose IT ($ ) over Business because I've tried both even though I'm from IT. I've switched to Business lately but still didn't really like it after a year of working on it... though it gives me more $ ..I still find daily I'm missing what I love to do most in IT, or development / UI /UX.  After some soul searching, I decided to go back to IT because that's what I love to do most despite that the business position that i""m working on provides more $.. .but daily is a chores living /doing things that I find no passion on and it felt depressing.
So go for what you love as long as you make sure the pathway to upgrade is providing enough for now and the future. Most of all, keep life simple so that $ doesn't become a driving for what you choose to do day to day.
Not many gets to F.I.R.E early, thus we gonna work at least for 30 to 40 years +/-. SoDo what you love, love what you do.
Hope it provides a different perspective. All the best!0 comments1"

If you study the course and then work in the same industry that you have absolutely no interest in, chances are you are not going to stay in the job for long or going to work just because you are bounded by a contract. I would advise you really sit back and really think hard about what you are passionate about in future before diving in and putting all the time and resources into it. Especially when Uni tuition fees are not cheap and you wouldn’t want to waste your time and money on it. If you are not sure what you like to do, do use Google to find out more about the syllabus, content of the course or narrow down the future jobs you want to land in and work backwards from there to find out what you need to do to get there.0 comments0"

6,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 25 Aug 2019Are you deciding on a uni degree? If so, then why not double degree/major? Personally, I would prefer to go with the one I have the most interest in as that allows me to perform my best. A ‘pass’ degree wouldn't allow you to stand out, but if you get First/Second class then it’ll be a good advantage over your peers, and subsequently draw higher income.0 comments0"
