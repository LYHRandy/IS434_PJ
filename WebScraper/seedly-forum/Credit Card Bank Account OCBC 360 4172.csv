1,"Edison PuaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 18 Apr 2019It depends on your spending pattern.One interesting thing I noticed is that installment on the GE Cashflo card counts, so that can be one of the sources if you have GE insurance policies.I tried using 365, but personally find it hard to hit the 800 min spending consistently for meaningful cashback. Considering changing to Frank or Titanium.If you high earner (120k p.a.), can also consider Voyage. At least this gives you miles regardless of spending.0 comments1"

Reason here is simple, basically being able to directly get bonus interest on your savings amount as well. For me, I'm getting: 1.2% + 0.3% + 0.3% = 1.8% monthly! (close to DBS Multiplier) but easier to manage in my opinion.You can check it out the best combo for savings accounts here: https://seedly.sg/tools/savings-account-calculator3 comments0"
3,"See all 3 comments Kenneth Lou10 Apr 2019Hey YewFong! Yup that is correct... ""To enjoy the above cashback, you need to spend a minimum of S$800 based on posted transactions in a calendar month. If you spend less than S$800, a flat 0.3% cashback is awarded.""

If you are unable to hit that amount, I would recommend this CIMB Visa signature which is at 10% cashback currently now and min spend is $600.YCYewFong Chua10 Apr 2019Hmm...looks fine to me. Just that I was thinking whether ocbc provide credit card that has minimum of spend is $500 and has the same benefit as ocbc 365.

Just dun understand why ocbc has to increase the minimum amount of spending."
