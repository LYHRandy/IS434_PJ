I'm using both Lim and Tan and Maybank KE. Both allows creation of watch list and monitoring of individual stock prices0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 04 Mar 2019I am currently using SGX mobile.Aside from adding your favourite stocks to your watchlist, you can also enable push notifications for company announcements as well as price. The watchlist also includes informative remarks such as CD or XD. Very intuitive with clean interface. App is free as well! 0 comments0"
