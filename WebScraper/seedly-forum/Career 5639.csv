1,"Yeap Ming FengLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018Hey! That was the same question I asked myself not too long ago. I think it mainly depends on your interest. I was interested in Growth Hacking, Tech and also Econs and Finance. From there you can go on and see where your area of interest lies and the skills required to get there.​Here's an article with a compilation of courses and academies that can help. ​https://blog.seedly.sg/degree-jobs-practical-ways/​Cheers!!0 comments2"

3,"Lee JiahuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 15 Aug 2018The way i see it, there are 2 broad scopes in fintech jobs - sales and software engineering. My background is software engineering so I will say that software engineering is a mountain to conquer if you come from a totally different background. An online course will probably just get you to the foot of the mountain, following maps can get you there but scaling it requires totally different skills. Sales on the other hand seems to have a lower barrier to entry.0 comments1"
4,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Aug 2018FinTech seems abit broad! You also need to ask yourself what aspect of the startup you would want to join. There are largely two main functions in any Fintech company (or startup for that matter):​Function 1: Product & EngineeringThis aspect is way more complicated to join Requires more than 1 - 2 years of work experience before getting a meaningful career opportunityFor us, we also see alot of people applying but lack a ton of real world exprerience actually building products For fintech specific, depends how deep you are looking to go. For a person doing a career switch, probably a front end role would suit best (but again, based on how many projects you have done before)Just doing 1 x course in some online program, will not adequetely help you understand how to build any real products, you should join as a intern or do hackathons or personal projectsFunction 2: MarketingThis is more straightforward and more personality basedHow do you show that you are creative and also data driven at the same timeHow do you show that you learn quickly in a ever changing spaceIn a sector that is always evolving with new channels, new methods and rules (every few weeks to months)Fun but intense work, willing to fail and learn quicklyYup! Hope these helps, and if you are looking to chat more, you can drop me an email or a comment below at kenneth@seedly.sg :) Cheers! and all the best in your job-career switch.0 comments1"

WonderkidAnswered on 15 Aug 2018If you don't know where to start, I'd suggest reaching out to people on LinkedIn who have jobs in fintech that you might be interested in. Tell them you're keen to find out more about how they got to where they are, and ask if they'd be willing to have a coffee chat with you. Make sure you do some solid homework first, because if they respond you'll need to have good questions prepared.​I've tried this a few times myself and got some very useful advice about conferences to attend, tips to navigate new environments, and skills/angles to focus on. 0 comments0"
7,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Aug 2018Good Question! FinTech, as the name reveals, is made up of Finance + Technology. To understand what are the different type of Fintech companies, you can either Google ""Fintech ecosystem"" or read on the reviews of the different Fintech products on the Seedly website!​If you really want to get into things like investments, Seedly has a section on that! https://seedly.sg/reviews/investment-coursesDo check it out!​All in all, you will have to have knowledge on both Finance and Technology, but can decide on which area you want to work in, before learning more in-depth about them0 comments0"
