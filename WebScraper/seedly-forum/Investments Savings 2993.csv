1,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 25 Sep 2018you need to first work out your basic expenses per month. Then multiply by 6. This will be your emergency funds. So in worst case scenario, you can last 6 months without any sales.​Do note that this is your cannot touch savings, so don’t use for holidays, etc. That belongs to a different saving goal. And always put back the money you spent during bad months.​After that you should be able to start investing. Don’t put everything to investing though. ​Youll also need to regularly review the monthly spending to make sure your emergency fund can always cover you for 6 months.​0 comments7"

Then save enough liquidity for your expenses that lasts this long. When u have it, invest the remainder. 0 comments2"
3,"Nicholas Woon, Marketing Director at ERA Realty Network Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 25 Sep 2018Hi-5! I feel you!​1) Like what Serene mentions, I set aside 6 months worth of expenses as my savings and do not touch them to tide through my down times. ​2) Next, I would have a secondary sum of money (operating cost) where I use for marketing cost like flyers and facebook marketing! I think it is important to set a budget for this before you start investing!​3) After that I got myself Singapore Savings Bond due to the liquidity of it! If I need the money urgently, I can redeem my money within the next 1 month.​4) I would also consider putting some money into CPF OA for the decent interest and I know I can use it to finance my house next time!​Lastly, I think it is very important to have the discipline not to overspend when I receive my commission due to the windfall effect! Always remember the tough times and be prudent in my spendings!0 comments2"

WizardAnswered on 25 Sep 20181) basic living expenses, your own and whole family(if any).2) operating cost for being able to continue business , advertising (car, adverts for property,coffee treats to potential clients )​Save the total of the 2 above based on your longest number of month without income + 4 months as drought savings (This is to ensure even the worst case scenario, you still have 4 months extra to cover). ​As much as possible , before any drought happens, should already starts now to find side gig / income that can receive monthly returns / immediate cash so that you do not need to touch the drought savings as much as posssible) ​Covering the above 2 to ensure you can continue day to day business as usual when there's no comm coming in due to earlier month less or no deals and the comm lead time.​There's plenty of strategy on investment here by Seedly content team.
