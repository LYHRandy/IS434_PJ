Does not require medical checkup, and will not need a submission of medical report. Only prerequisite is that you have not had cancer before.1) $40/mth: Singapore only. Early stage payout =12k, Late stage payout =80k2) $66/mth: Covers anywhere. Early stage payout =45k, Late stage payout =150k2 answersAnswerBump6"

WonderkidAnswered on 27 Apr 2019Assuming the policies offer the same coverage for the same premium, always get from an insurance company. This is becos there will be someone servicing you if you get from insurance company, but not from the bank.Of course there is likelihood that your insurance agent is irresponsible or he/she may leave the company, but at least you still get higher chance of being serviced after purchaing the plan.0 comments1"
