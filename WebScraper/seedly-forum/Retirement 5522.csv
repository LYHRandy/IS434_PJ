God of WisdomAnswered on 17 Mar 20191) High capital guarantee2) Flexible payout3) High Projected Yield (above 4%)4) Pays out for life (If you want shorter, get a retirement plan - the difference is that a retirement plan pays down your capital to 0, while a lifetime annuity protects your capital)5) Benchmark it against CPF Life. (Many people think CPF Life is the best, but it may not be. It's definitely bloody amazing, but I can confidently say not the best - start another private annuity early enough and you can contribute lesser premiums to get a higher projected payout with 0 capital loss, unlike CPF Life)Start one as early as possible. It's one of the best ways to receive a guaranteed passive stream of income for life. Even dividend income and rental income are active streams as you have to manage your assets, unlike the annuity.0 comments1"
