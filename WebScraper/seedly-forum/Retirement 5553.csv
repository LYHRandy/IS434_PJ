ProdigyAnswered on 17 Dec 2018I will go for either1) Retirement plans from Insurance companies2) Build-my-own by buying into Bonds (30%) and Dividend stocks (70%)These 2 will help me to fund my retirement. As you mentioned your friend is a ful time freelancer, this demographic personnel usually won't put money into CPF, thus the above 2 recommendation is for your friend's consideration.0 comments1"
2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Dec 2018Then she should be reducing all her taxable income (if any) as a freelancer. Or even wake up her idea that CPF has a 3.5% to 5% interest that can form part of her retirement. Or better yet, maybe she should be increasing her income to pay heavy tax (so to benefit from RSTU and SRS).Why would you be worried if you have a plan. You are worried only if you have none right? 0 comments0"
