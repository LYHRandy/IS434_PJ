question,"Insurance Asked by Bang HongAsked on 29 Jul 2019Should someone with S$2000 outpatient insurance from their company try to make full use of it?A friend came to me for advice on this matter from a financial perspective. Noted that there may have some ethical concerns but looking to discuss this from a financial pov.Co-payment of S$5 is required for each visit.YTD - Utilized ~$800Balance - ~$1200Can visit a doctor and ask for expensive meds (i.e. probiotics) and each visit about $100-$200 to avoid suspicious/flagged out for audits. From a needs basis, if there is use for the meds it is okay. What are your views/comments?1 answerAnswerBump0"

You never know when you might need a large outpatient claim.If it's not possible to roll forward, then sure. Go to GP for any minor ache and pain and let him suggest tests and treatment to make you well. You can research about supplements and vitamins then ask GP if he is able to prescribe them to you as part of treatment or overall health maintenance.There's no ethical dilemma here as it is your entitlement to use it. As long as it benefits you medically then I think it's fine.0 comments0"
