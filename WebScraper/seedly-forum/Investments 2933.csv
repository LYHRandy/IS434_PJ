1,Sandy ChamLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jun 2018As Warren Buffet once mentioned there is no intrinsic value in gold. It doesn't generate income nor will it have a guaranteed value. Also its use as a backing for currency is limited. However. It can be considered a safe haven. But consider investing or Singapore Savings bond which can appreciate in value. 0 comments2
2,"Marcus GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Hi Shawn,​As Gabriel mentioned, either you could invest in an Gold ETF (Stock Symbol of GLD) or you could purchase the physical gold.​There are two types of assets:Non-Income Producing AssetsGold, Silver​Income Producing AssetsStocks, REITs (Pay Dividend)​Additionally, gold prices will be inversely correlate to the price of the dollar. If USD dollar drops, Gold will rise in prices and vice-versa.​So you could study a little bit into Macroeconomy if you looking into commodities like Gold so you can make inform choices. Always do you due diligence.​This is more like an informative post. I hope it helps! :)0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 18 Jun 2018Gold is a great diversification tool for those who are bearish on the US Dollar as it is negatively corellated.​In terms of a buy and hold strategy, it may work out if you have a really long investment horizon, and have an exit plan on a particular spot price.​Like every asset class, make sure you do your due dilligence and study on the thoughts of gold investors both bulls and bears.0 comments0"
