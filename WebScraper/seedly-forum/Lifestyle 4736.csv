1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Jul 2019On food - I know it's difficult to aim for $5/meal in the CBD area, but it is possible provided you brave the long queues and stuffy hawker environments. I still try to target that though - Amoy and Maxwell if in the Tanjong Pagar area. Unfortunately for Raffles Place, the cheaper food options have decreased with the moving of Golden Shoe Hawker.  If I am super frugal about it - baseline of $5 per meal ie. $10 per day (2 meals) and total of $300 a month.
Exercise is my entertainment - so I have a gym membership which costs a little over $100 a month.
Transport - on average $3-4 a day with public transport. So $120 a month.
Shopping - don't really shop unless I need to replace something.
So the range is $500-$1000 - with the latter being me not being so frugal when it comes to food and other snacks.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 03 May 2019I think this is quite subjective.  im assuming you are not taking into account any big ticket items? eg looking at just transport, food, entertainment, shopping etc,  and not like housing, car etc because it would be realy hard to find a basis for comparison0 comments0"
