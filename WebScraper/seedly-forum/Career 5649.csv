Grand MasterAnswered on 07 Sep 2019The character to thrive in IT, Engineer, Business or Accounting are actually quite different.Accounting is a stable field, but you need to be meticulously detailed and.. well it's boring.Engineering- you need to take care of details too... and able to think in different layers and dimension.Business-  not sure if you mean running a business later with your degree.. need to be an all-rounder, need to handle stress and excitementIT - technical stuff and jargons. Totally different from accounting or business0 comments0"
