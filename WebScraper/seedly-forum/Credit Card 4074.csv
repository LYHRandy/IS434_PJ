1,"Dexter TiahLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jun 2019Hi, there is actually an answer to your specific question and similar questions like these. Basically, you can key in the merchant ""Grabpay"" in the search field in www.whatcard.sg. In that site, you can see the rewards offered by the various credit cards, to optimize your cashback/rewards! I did this for your question, and the result is: Amex Ascend has the best miles reward (3.2mpd), and HSBC Advance has the best cashback (2.5%, subject to you hitting S$2k spending that month) for Grabpay.0 comments2"
2,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019You team cashback or team miles? I would suggest the DBS WWMC for miles, following by AMEX ascend. Not sure for team cashback though.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 13 Jul 2019Hi there, currently the best credit card reward we know of for Grabpay topups is through the UOB One card, mainly because of the very generous extra 5% cashback on ALL Grab transactions (including topup, Grab Food, Grab rides) that is given above and beyond the standard cashback tiers for UOB One card (up to 5%). At a maximum cashback rate of 8-10%, this will give a higher value than any miles cards we know of (that give at most 4 miles/dollar on Grab)We also wrote a longer article detailing how to maximise cashback on UOB One card through Grabpay topups that you may be interested to check out to learn how to get the maximum rewards on Grab0 comments0"
