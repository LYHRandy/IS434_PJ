1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Apr 2019Best form of investment differs for all. For someone who has a low tolerance for risks, that individual will tell you SSB's / ETF's / Temasek Bonds would be considered his 'Best' investmentsFor someone else who has a high risk tolerance, that individual will tell you Bitcoin, Stocks, Options, CFD's, DLC's would be considered his 'Best' investments. Furthermore, to take things a step further, your Best form of investment MAY NOT BE your most comfortable form of investment. Which is more important if you were to ask me? I would go for comfortable form of investment, one that allows you to sleep soundly at night. Nonetheless, dip your toes in both spectrums of investment tools to know yourself better.0 comments1"
2,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Apr 2019After about a year here, I do find that a lot of the people here will advise you to invest in one thing: yourself. In order to get the best returns, you firstly need to know what you are doing. It's very hard to just follow what everyone else is doing, and expect results from that. Moreover, you should invest in what you are passionate in- I don't mean just money. After all, no one else can tell you how to live your life. You know what makes you happy, and you know what makes you feel like you lived life to the fullest.Back on to the topic of finance- just a couple of years ago, some people might tell you the best form of investment would be cryptocurrency. If you asked 1M65, he would have told you CPF. The best form of investment depends on what you want, so invest in yourself. Gain some knowledge, and choose what to do from there.0 comments1"
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Apr 2019I think the best form of investment is education. You'll have to invest your time, effort, and money (sometimes) into something in order to get results.As long as you get educated in a certain subject, chances are, you make much fewer mistakes and excel more than the average joe.0 comments0"

5,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 2019Hello!As Brandon has mentioned, there is no such thing as a best form of investment. No matter what investment you do it will come with risks.  It is just a matter of how high these risks are and how comfortable you are with taking risks. The 'best' investment is relative to everyone, it would depend on your individual portfolio and also your age. For example, if you are young many would advice you to do dollar cost averaging. However, if you are older dollar cost averaging may not be the type of investment that would be suitable for you.You would need to determine which investment is the 'best' for you based on your own portfolio.0 comments0"
6,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 2019There is no such thing as a best form of investment.All investments come with risk. At the end of the day, what matters most is your risk appetite/profile, stage of life and portfolio allocation.For example, some of my clients are younger and are more growth-oriented. For such clients, they would be open to taking up a larger proportion of equities and high yielding fixed income instruments in their portfolio.Whereas for another segment of my clients that are older and nearing retirement, they would prefer to allocate a higher proportion of their assets into Capital Guaranteed Instruments or solutions that will provide them with sufficient passive income.At the end of the day, education is key. For starters, you may want to read up some articles on Seedly or connect with me. I can be reached via  https://www.facebook.com/brandan.chen0 comments0"
