1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered on 20 Jul 2019I would advice you to get more knowledge first. You can find many resources online, and beefing up your own knowledge doesn't cost a cent, but will save you from making the wrong financial decisions later on. Once you have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, you can speak to a independent financial advisor like myself to refine your knowledge and plug any gaps before you start.The worst thing you could do now is to rush in. I presume you are still very young and hence time is still on your side.0 comments6"

Before thinking about investments, its great if you could clear outstanding loans.Investment is long term and taking on one while you still have student debts etc to clear isn't wise :) Once you've cleared your student debts and loans, I found the 50-30-20 guide rather useful:Savings (20%)Expenses (no more than 50%)Investments (30%)You can read more about this here: https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-allocate-your-monthly-salary/ Savings (20%)Save your 20% in a high i/r bank such as the DBS Multiplier account. You can find a suitable high i/r bank that best suits your needs here: https://blog.seedly.sg/best-savings-accounts-singapore/Investments (30%)For the 30% allocated salary for investments, it's great for a beginner to start with a very basic SSB and RSP, which is what you did. If you prefer a safer bet, you can always go for bonds and other endowment plans.For your next step, you can try out investing in some Index, such as STI..-If you'd like to try something more adventurous, I'd suggest investing in blue chips- a stock in a corporation with a national reputation for quality, reliability, and the ability to operate profitably in good times and bad. These stocks are not as risky, and will be beneficial for you if you are looking at a long term investment plan. However, remember to do a ton of research on these companies or funds before buying those chips. Beyond that, if you're looking to invest in the stock market, you will have to:Open a CDP account with the government https://blog.seedly.sg/step-step-guide-opening-stock-trading-brokerage-cdp-account-singapore/Find a broker- someone that will be the middleman between you and SGX.However, I'd highly encourage you to engage in lower risk investments first, know more about the stock market and do your research before going in. The stock market has high risks and (potentially high returns), so it pays to be cautious when investing!EDITTook so long to type these out wtheck but I found this right after and it's pretty good so you can check it out:
