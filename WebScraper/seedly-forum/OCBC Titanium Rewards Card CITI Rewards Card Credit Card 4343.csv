1,"YY Yin YuLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jun 2018I just want to highlight the bonus points about citibank rewards because these two cards offer similar rewards for shopping.From now till 31 July 2018, CR gives 8mpd for Apple Pay transaction. No cap.From now till 8 July 2018 Shop at Lazada and earn 8 miles for every S$1 spent ​On top of that, they offer Up to 10% Citi Rebate at over 300 locations, including Starbucks, Subway and Sheng Siong. So you are practically getting 2 times rewards.​If you are a LiveUp member, you get 8% rebate instead of 5%. ​Though the above mentioned promotion has validity till July, if you need to apply the card now, grab the opportunity. ​​0 comments1"
2,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 Jun 2018Just by looking purely at the credit card reviews, you can see a few things! I'm personally using any of these cards yet but I'm defintiely interested in the CITI rewards card.​CITI Rewards: (5 stars by 8 reviewers):​""Best card I have as i get the most rebates or miles out of it. On lazada membership giving lots of rebates for lazada (now 8% rebates), Grab and Chope and RedMart purchases and most miles for most online shopping. I only use this card for the 4x miles return for the above and avoid using it when it gives me less than that equivalent. ""​OCBC Titanium Rewards (3.7 stars by 4 reviewers):​""Not much benefit for me. I prefer cash back than points. And there’s some restrictions on retailers which apply for extra bonuses. I was even tired to read the details. The customer service for credit card section is also not really friendly or helpful. Just minimal helpfulness. Hardly use this card unless retailers have some OCBC promotion ongoing.""0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2018Why not both?​Both cards are similar but it really depends on what you are looking out for.​If you are using them to collect points, jus head over to their rewards catalogue and see which bank has more rewards you want to redeem.if you are collecting miles, Citi now has a slight advantage due to their partnership with Apple Pay to provide 8mpd.0 comments0"
