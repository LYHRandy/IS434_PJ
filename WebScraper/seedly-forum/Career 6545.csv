God of WisdomAnswered on 03 Jan 2019Woah, what a turn of events.Honestly, it's gonna be hard working for someone who thinks you don't deserve a raise until they realise how important you are. And in the future, if you think you should be promoted or in line for another raise, must you do the same thing to get your way? It'll be too hard to stay for me. BUT, I might take one month salary to boost my 'last drawn salary' stat, and then apply for another company. Gotta be savage. 0 comments2"

I think it highly depends on your relationship with your boss, any potential changes to your scope, and also your comfort level on the culture at your company.To me, a raise may potentially come with more responsibilities (depending on the extent of the raise) so it is important to clarify this before you make your decision. Also, because it is clear that your boss only appears to treasure you when you resigned, there must be other reasons that triggered you to resign on top of the above mentioned reason. Everyone's personal situation differs so do consider carefully and weigh your options against your own personal situation and also with what's available in the market.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 03 Jan 2019He know that you did good enough for a raise and despite that dont want give you a raise for some reasons and only offer when you decide to resign. If you can find a job, i think you should leave.0 comments0"

WonderkidAnswered on 03 Jan 2019I don't think you should stay as your boss doesn't realize how valuable you are - which will means you will ""stuck"" at your current pay / position before you send him another resignation letter as reminder...Nonetheless, it is worthwhile to work for another 1-2 months, at least get the variable bonus before you leave, this time round makes sure you secure a job offer before tendering.P/S: I would not be pleased if my boss said I don't deserve a pay rise. 0 comments0"
