1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Dec 2018Don't be hasty to jump on the investment train.  You're still young, there's so much you have to know. Invest in yourself first. Read up on basic investment strategies. Our public libraries have some excellent materials (seen some ads at train stations that showcased some good books like the intelligent investor). Set aside emergency funds first. Start small and get your feet wet before jumping into the deep. Small bite sized investments you can consider for a start are sti Etf or the abf bond fund offered through posb's invest saver, maybank ke's monthly investment plan (Blue chip, sti etfs and reits). Consider these if you have more of a risk appetite; starts at $100 a month. Robo advisories can be considered as well for $50 a month from Smartly - these allow you to create portfolios based on your risk profile. We were all once like you are now, and it's not easy. Take your time, think a lot, do your due diligence. Then take the first step. All the best! 0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 31 Oct 2018You should protect your downside and build an emergency fund first before investing.Once you've done that, choose between being an active investor or a passive one. If you're active, learn to stock pick. If you're passive, just purchase a globally diversified portfolio from a Robo Advisor or an FA. 0 comments0"
