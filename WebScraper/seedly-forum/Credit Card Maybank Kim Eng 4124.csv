1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey there anon!I've been researching into student-friendly CCs lately too and considered the 2 you mentioned as well.Here's my opinion: I prefer the DBS Live Fresh CC over the Maybank eVibes CCThe cashback from the DBS Live Fresh CC isn't just 0.3%, there're different cashback percentages for different types of spend. Check this answer I recently did with a more thorough analysis of the DBS Live Fresh CC!Objectively speaking, the DBS Live Fresh CC might fall short of the Maybank eVibes CC because there're monthly caps on the cashbacks you can redeem (read more in my answer!). Based on Maybank's eVibes CC T&Cs, there isn't a monthly cap on the cashbacks you can redeem.That being said, I still prefer the DBS Live Fresh CC because it helps boost my interest rates on my DBS Multiplier account. If you intend to open a DBS Multiplier account in due time, I highly recommend you get the DBS Live Fresh CC instead!To close, the monthly caps imposed by the DBS Live Fresh CC wouldn't be too much of an issue unless you spend a lot - which i assume you wouldn't as a student as I don't too.
