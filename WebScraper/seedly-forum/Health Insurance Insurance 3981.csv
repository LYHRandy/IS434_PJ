MasterAnswered on 06 Dec 2018You can start to invest long term to build up a financial fallback in the event of extreme emergency/disease. Aside from them, you should also consider three things:1) GIO plans - because they will still provide you additional benefits regardless of your c ondition, and may be better for preservation of your capital.2) Pre-existing insurance plans - Such as AIA Diabetes and PruTerm which may cover you despite your preexisting condition. 3) Topping up your Medisave - because it will be your primary fallback and compounds at a guaranteed rate. You can always nudge me if you would like help on these matters. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
