SGS bonds and Treasury bills (T-bills) are issued to meet banksâ€™ needs for a risk-free asset in their liquid-asset portfolios. And also other institutions such as insurers/nonbanks will need such risk-free assets. It is also part of Singapore broader strategy to grow Singapore as an international center for asset management/debt capital management etc. The Tbills/bond yields will also serve as benchmark riskfree rates in the market.SSB is created to provide singaporeans with another option for savings, complementing CPF/SRS and other investment tools in the market. Singapore government invest the monies received from issue these bonds. If the investmentdebt cost, our nation's reserves will grow. 0 comments0"
