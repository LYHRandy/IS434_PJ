1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 11 Sep 2018Too many news makes one confuse. Stick to your investment plan. Most are just noise which make the stock go up or down. For long term, we focus on fundamentals. Unless the news really affected the fundamental, usually just read and take it with a pinch of salt.​​0 comments0"
