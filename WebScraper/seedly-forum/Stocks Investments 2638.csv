1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Personally, I feel that 'The Intelligent Investor' is a bit dry to read, very philosophical. I found myself having a hard time to finish the book! However, the book does give some good key insights for developing an investing plan. Do note that the emphasis is not on detailed stock picking, so it gives you more of a general/ broad idea. If you have the revised edition, there is a commentary after each chapter which includes more current examples and references. I found that it was helpful to read the commentary before reading the chapter! 0 comments1"
2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Feb 2019There's a site that lists out the lessons that can be picked up from that book! (https://medium.com/@dlishego/lessons-from-ben-grahams-the-intelligent-investor-f126c6b10535) Personally, by biggest take away is that you should focus on the underlying value of the business. This tip is of course mentioned by a lot of others, but I think Graham lays it out very well. For me, it is a timely reminder not to just enter the market solely because of price fluctuations, but to really understand the value of the stock that represents the business. Owning stocks of a company that is just riding on volatility and speculation does not really appeal to me. I think that if stocks are over or undervalued, they should be priced correctly over time. 0 comments0"
