1,"Ernest Yeam Wee LeongLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 17 Apr 2019If the person is jobless and wants to have enough money coming in from investing which i assume it to be from dividends, a large amount of money is required if based on monthly living expenses of $2000 per month.From the table, with a 5% dividend yield, minimum $480,000 capital is required to achieve $2000 monthly income for expenses.Having $1,000,000 capital invested will leave you with approx $4,166 per month to spend.0 comments3"

WonderkidUpdated on 17 Apr 2019Investment income is a good supplement but it is unlikely able to match your employment income unless you have built up a substantial portfolio already.If you dread going to work, consider what your passion is and then plan to work in it, than work becomes fun and not a drag to go to everyday! There is no perfect job but finding purpose and meaing is extremely important for sustaining a fulfilling career. All the best Anonymous!0 comments1"

With enough skills over time and if you are good, I guess you could earn enough passive income to not have to rely on the salary income from the job or business income. Probably go into full time investing from there. This is not common though.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 20 Apr 2019You will need a sizeable portfolio if you want to go into full time investing, but this also depends on the returns you are able to generate. Good example will be what Ernest has mentioned in his reply. I'll add on to say you will need not just a return to cover your expenses, but also to grow your portfolio over time. This is one method where you generate income passively via stock dividends. There is another one where you actively manage your portfolio, trading to be exact. This will require more skill and you will need a system in place. This can generate a higher rate of return, bypassing the need for a huge portfolio size. You need to see what you are comfortable with and start from there. I'm in the midst of transiting to becoming a full time investor in a couple of years or so. Looking to make this happen once my account has reached 6 figures in size and a bit more.0 comments0"
