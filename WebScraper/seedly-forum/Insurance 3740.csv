question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Jul 2019What are the insurance plans available in the market for your parents?Recently, I discovered that my uncle has no insurance plans at all. He is around 64-66years old and has retired many years ago. Smoker for many years, and with diabetes, and possibly high blood pressure and cholesterol. Wonder if there are any plans in the market that are available for him with these health conditions? The priority is medical and hospitalization coverage.2 answersAnswerBump0"

Even Raffles Health might reject the proposal. But if you really want to apply they might be your best bet.I suggest to get the MerdekaCare PA plan from NTUC as well. :)0 comments2"

I recommend you try Aviva for as they have a momaritum underwriting option. Read this link below. In short, Moratorium underwriting offers the chance of having pre-existing conditions covered after a period of time.https://www.sgmoneymatters.com/moratorium-underwriting-by-aviva/Cheers!2 comments0"
