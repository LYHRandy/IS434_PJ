The Dividends shouldn't truly matter in the grand scheme of things. like what everyone is saying - if the company is healthy, showing good structure and having a sustainable, forward looking business model, you could very well be holding on to a undervalued stock. The markets may take some time to correct inefficiencies due to irrational behavior of investors, so there may be cases that these winning stocks are undervalued for some time. However if they're really quite shaky and having internal troubling signs like rising D/E, constant changing of management, belonging in a sunset industry, best cash out while it still is worth cash!0 comments1"

4,"Jay Liu, Sleepyhead at Land of Dreams Level 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Sep 2018Find out what the company did e.g. acquisition.  Try not to fail paper loss. But also read on news of the company you're invested in. If they happen to be some company that are in financial trouble, it's better to minimise your loss. Don't let it be a next case of eerrhmm. If the company is OK continue to hold. Or even pump in more in average out the paper price. 0 comments0"

7,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You should be holding onto stocks not because you are young, but because the company has good fundamentals and lower price makes a better bargain. Onto the next point, not all stocks will rebound after some years, it depends on the industry and the fundamentals of the company(the debt, cash flow, etc). It's important to do your research on the company first before making any decision.1 comment0"
8,Kishor Bhagwat31 Mar 2019Total Return = Dividends + Capital gain. Is this meeting your needs? Are you beating inflation? Do you have the confidence to use the money elsewhere and earn more?  Would you buy the same stocks today? If yes then its great that they are still cheap! These are some of the things you need to think about and then decide. Remember that holding an investment is just as active a decision as not buying or buying a stock...they all need good reasons.
