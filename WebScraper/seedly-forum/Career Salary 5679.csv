question,"Career Salary Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Jul 2019Should I make a career switch from construction to IT?Currently earning $4k as an engineering consultant for 2 years in the construction industry, no bonus no AWS. I got an offer for a graduate program for the same amount, they don't offer any bonus as well. To be honest, I'm not hyped up or excited about working in IT or construction, I'm just thinking which one would allow me to earn the most money. Anyone got any idea? Yeah, I know I sound very materialistic, but yeah.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Jia Ni TohLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 30 Jul 2019I don't think you sound materialistic. You sound rational.
Since both your current job and the graduate programme both offer the same financial rewards (regarding salary and bonus), then you're asking about career progression and potential growth in earnings. And you have picked a good time to consider a career switch, because you sound quite young (still in your twenties).
Since you didn't provide many details about your current job and the IT graduate programme, I'm just going to point out that your current construction job gives you 4K a month _after _two years of work experience, whereas this entry-level graduate programme gives you the same amount. So if you're looking for growth in salary, and if you find construction engineering and IT equally easy, then you have nothing to lose by going for the IT job.Perhaps the bigger problem is that you've already said, you aren't interested in either of these career paths. I would question why you're focused on getting jobs in fields that _don't _interest you. However, Cal Newport has written about why you shouldn't select a career based on passion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMu1PGbG-0, and since he's very successful, lets follow him on his advice instead.
I'd reccommend that you take the IT job, try to change your expectations of your work. I'm confident you can do this thing, and eventually you will find satisfaction in your job.2 comments1"
2,Question Poster30 Jul 2019Yeah that's what I was wondering about. Both gave the same pay while 1 gave it after 2 years of experience and the other right off the bat. I'm wondering which one would be better career progression and stability wise. I feel like I can do well in both even thought I'm not totally passionate in both.Question Poster30 Jul 2019And thanks man!

The worst thing to do is to jump onboard (into IT sector) without ensuring you have what it takes to sustain yourself in the ship. You can get kick off board. Even if you switch now, what if the satisfaction in monetary gains wears off? What if you cannot do well in IT sector etc? Donâ€™t walk your way into a blackhole. Look at those PMETs who thought they have experiences and qualifications. Yet, they were still susceptible to being retrenched, or have to accept pay-cut just to keep the job.  By saying that you are not hyped up or excited about doing the job, you have already sentenced yourself to failure. You get the job, you get the higher salary, but it will not last long. If monetary gains is what motivates you, then go do sales. It seems like having clarity in your career interests and skills sets is the first step. Please get yourself a career coach to guide you in career development. Good luck pal.0 comments1"
