For my my dividends I received them directly into my Saxo account. Also depending on what currency your account is in your dividend may be converted to your account currency. E.g my account is in USD, so when I received dividends from my U.S investments I received them in USD, but if your account is in SGD and you received dividends in USD it will be automatically converted to SGD. so make sure you choose the correct currency for your account.0 comments2"
