I remember you saying you're in your 20s.We will be retired for about 25 to 30 years. So now, if I give you 450k, will you be able to stop all work and survive for the next 25 to 30 years? If not, then no 1m is not enough to retire.Start by calculating how much you will need if you stop work today and have to survive for 25 to 30 years. Then adjust that figure for inflation until your retirement age.10 comments3"

You can set aside BRS only if you do a property pledge. You'll still get the full FRS amount but only half will be from your RA. I would still delay to 70, again free money, which not only increases your payouts but delays the depletion of your bequest. You don't actually earn from your CPF Life premiums until you outlive the bequest depletion to 0 at the 16th year mark. So delaying earns you 6-7% extra, which is higher than RA gives you.

ProdigyAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Whether $1million in hard cash is adequate depends on a combination of conscious choices rather than a figurative amount.1) Are you going to rely entirely & periodically withdrawd on that $1M by the time your retire? Or are you going to invest that principal amount & reinvest the dividend and/or interest income with the aim of growing the initial lumpsum and subsequently relying on its returns to meet monthly expenses?2) Have you considered the possiblity & willingness of migrating to a lower-cost location eg: Thailand, Vietnam should your retirement sum proved to be inadequate down the road?3) Is your financial obligations (etc taking care of dependents, parents & children) by the time you retire going to wind down or increase? Will your house mortgage be fully paid?4) When you retire & no longer receving a salary, can you & your familiy adjust the lifestyle requirements? The ability to acheive ""budget deflation"" is an essential component of ensuring expenses not exceeding passive income/budgeted withdrawal of retirement sum5) Did you consider how much cash you can withdraw from your CPF by the time of age 55 & the amount of cash payouts from your CPF Life from age 65. This would & should supplement the cash you had set aside for retirement outside of CPF.I feel that by asking this hard questions, would at least give some framework into planning for an individual financial retirement as opposed to assigning a ballpark $$ figure that on first sight seem sufficientCheers :)0 comments0"
