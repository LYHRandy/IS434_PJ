WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Zeng, Douglas here. 2nd keynote speaker.Yes property prices in general will continue to rise in Singapore but slower than before due to the cooling measures. Investing in other countries has its own unique set of risks so do all the necessary homework and don't get burnt like other folks before you.Propert investment in Singapore is easy because data is transparent and easily available but not always so for foreign countries, so u have to check with their respective property agents or agency where to access a centralised database.​​​

So the rise in singapore property is due to the above 2 factors
Choose a country with rapid gdp growth and population growth then it is very likely property price will rise rapidly.0 comments2"
