1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Apr 2019Well, large debts are relative and debt is not always a bad thing. We shouldnt simply cast the assumption that having large debts make a company not good for investmentThe more important thing to look at is what is the purpose of the company taking up debt, as well as their ability to repay the debts.For example, if we were to look at Apple and Microsoft which has more than 50Bn in debt, but holds more cash then debt. Would you still invest in such companies?Hence, debt size or D/E ratio may just be one of the many indicators that investors look at when picking a stock. It is more important to understand how to interpret the financial statements and whether the company has good growth prospects.0 comments2"
