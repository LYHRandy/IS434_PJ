In that case, the only purpose would be for earning the interest rates from cpf. However, do note that the monies topped up will only be disbursed to your parents gradually via monthly payouts from 65 onwards; it won't be available as a lump sum withdrawal. 0 comments1"

You will be able to top up their CPF OA account for a reasonable, completely liquid interest of 2.5%. You will also continue to enjoy tax relief. If they are already above 55 and have met FRS, it's locked in. 1 comment0"
