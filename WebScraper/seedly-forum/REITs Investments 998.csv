WonderkidUpdated on 12 Jun 2019Mapletree Industrial Trust (MIT) @ 2.14 PriceP/B ratio = 1.42Distribution Yield = 5.68%Gearing = 33.8%Ascendas REIT @ 2.97 PriceP/B Ratio = 1.39Distribution Yield = 5.40%Gearing = 36.3%Overall MIT is a better pick, due to a slightly higher distribution yield and lower gearing, but right now it is pretty expensive @ 1.42 PB ratio, so maybe wait for it to drop in price before picking it up?3 comments1"
2,"See all 3 comments Question Poster12 Jun 2019I'm quite new to reits, and I would like to find out If I were to purchase MIT using a RSP, do I have to be concern about the current price?Gavin Tan12 Jun 2019Hey Question Poster, personally, I feel that it would not matter because if you invest regularly, the price will be averaged down. A common phrase you'll hear is always ""Having time in the market, is better than timing the market itself"""
3,"Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 12 Jun 2019Hi, I actually analysed Mapletree Industrial Trust and Ascendas Reit in January 2019. Before analysing both REITS, I always felt that both are equally good. However, I feel that AREIT is far more superior that MIT in almost all the categories that I compared. I would still choose AREIT over MIT but there is no harm in buying MIT. If I have spare cash, I would buy MIT too if I want to own as many industrial buildings in Singapore.0 comments0"
