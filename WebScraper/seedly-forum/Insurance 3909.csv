God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'll recommend a WL plan only if it covers for Critical Illness. A pure death cover WL plan is not the most ideal.So the rule of thumb is 3-5 X of your income is coverage for Critical Illness and I'll recommend you to get this for Whole of Life.If you have dependents, I'll add death coverage in the event of death only for a term till retirement age for about 5-10 X of your annual income. So, if you're making 50k a year, a 150k-250k WL policy with CI & ECI and another 250k-500k Term cover for death till retirement.You also have to manage a budget as well, so try to keep costs for insurance to be max 10% of your income.
