WonderkidAnswered on 10 Apr 2019Whichever gives you more value.Even though Kaligo has 10x miles, they often mark up the prices more than other online travel agents (OTAs).Do a quick calculation to see whether the additional cost is worth the 10x miles, and whether the 10x miles earned is worth more or less than the 1 free night. All these depend onthe additional cost,your personal valuation of a mile, and choice of hotel property for the 1 free night.0 comments1"
