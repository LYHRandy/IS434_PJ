question,"Savings Asked by Jacqueline YanAsked on 12 Sep 2019Should the 3-6 months emergency fund be based on our expenses or salary?Recently saw some sources suggesting an emergency fund should be equivalent to 3-6 months of our salary. I'd assume that it might not make that much difference for someone starting work since the gap between our expenses and salary may not be that big. But ideally, our income will have a larger surplus for us to put into savings and investments, and the amount in our emergency fund will differ rather drastically. Is there a scenario that's better to use our salary as the basis of the fund?2 answersAnswerBump0"

Grand MasterUpdated on 13 Sep 2019Yes, it might not make such a difference for someone just starting work... or anytime. As salary increase, so does commitment (family expenses, marriage, kids...)3 to 6 months is itself a wide range. I will say at least 3 months of salary.Or 6 months of expenses :)PS: personally I don't have emergency funds myself. I know in an emergency I can rely on my credit facilities, business sales or assets. Or just borrow from a friend.... kidding.1 comment2"
2,"Jacqueline Yan13 Sep 2019That's true! I was working on the assumption that I'll be able to keep my expenses low (to a reasonable level) even as commitment increases.

I'm hoping to start investing but I wanted to make sure I've got enough in my emergency fund. 

Thanks for sharing!"
