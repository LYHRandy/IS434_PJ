question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 01 Feb 2019What is the financial impact of a person who serve national service versus someone who does not?Read the seedly article on this and felt the study is myopic. Can we have a study that looks at the financial impact on a person who serves ns vs one who does not, over a career that ends at the same retirement age, same starting pay and same increment percentage? I think your number is too low.2 answersAnswerBump0"

Your second pt is exactly what i am going at with regards to the study done by seedly. Its too simplistic to look at the impact over 2 years vs the whole career..... the impact is not small and its there. Just trying to shed some light on the real scrifice on ppl who serve ns0 comments0"
2,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You really can't track this because people do different things after NS. If I serve National Service and go on to start a successful business because I learnt to work with men from all walks of life, that's a positive financial impact. If I stopped working hard after that because I learnt during my time that you'll get paid no matter what job you do, that's a negative financial impact.  and these two things actually happne.If you're talking about the 2 year difference and we're both teachers - this is a pretty common scenario for at least a 5 to 10 year career in education - the men will likely never catch up unless they were particularly ambitious. This is a fact. The tiny increments from service could never hope to match up against the government increments, additional years of experience actually DOING the job and the much higher likelihood of promotion.Yeap.https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.541 comment0"
