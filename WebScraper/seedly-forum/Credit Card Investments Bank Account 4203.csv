1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 19 Mar 2019For my non-salary crediting accounts, I use both CIMB Fast Saver and also the Citibank Citi MaxiGain Savings Account. In terms of priority though, I put the max in the Citi MaxiGain Savings Account first, with the rest going to other accounts. Based on latest as of 19th March:Around 1% base interest (70% of the 1-month SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offer Rate))Bonus interest rate that steps up month, starting from 0.1% p.a. to a maximum of 1.2% p.a0 comments0"

3,"Vincent TanLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 07 Aug 2018Citibank MaxiGain as recommended by Isabella if you have at least 15k to start a banking relationship with Citibank (if not there would be a $15 monthly fall below fee). Based on current Sibor, the interest starts at 1.2% and step up monthly by 0.1% if average account balance is higher than previous month. It takes one year to realize full potential of 2.4% (higher if Sibor increase).​Charmaine‘s recommendation is good if you don’t want to worry about anything and just get 1% on your savings (min deposit 1k).​Another option is Singapore Savings Bond. The next issue (Sep 18) is 1.75% for the 1st year with an average return of 2.44% if you hold for 10 years. You can redeem the SSB at any time with no penalty. Do note that you need to have a CDP account to apply for SSB and each application has a $2 transaction fee. Min application is $500 and in multiples of $500. The maximum SSB an individual can hold is capped at 100k.​0 comments0"
4,"Isabella JoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Aug 2018Citibank Maxigain savings account. It doesn't require salary crediting, gives high interest rate of 1.2-2.4% (monthly step up of 0.1%).
Downside is interest rate will drop if you withdraw and minimal balance is S$15k.I think it's good if you want to stash away some money which you don't have immediate use. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 06 Aug 2018For savings only I recommend CIMB Fast Saver. https://seedly.sg/reviews/savings-accounts/cimb-fast-saverI'd recommend you to ensure you have sufficient savings first then invest; so it'd be prudent to do both with higher on investment if you already have a sound savings nest.​Investments wise you may want to understand more about REITs, ETFs and auto wealth & stashaway from the product review and blog area.​Hope this helps!0 comments0"
