2,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 29 May 2019Hey there. One of the best annuity we have in Singapore is CPF life. (I won’t go into CPF Life details here)
But for starters I will recommend that you max out CPF life to ERS level (base on your future age) and you can get about 1,500/month.The payout for CPF life starts at 65. So you may split your annuity plan into 2 portion
1. 55 yrs to 65 yrs 
2. 65 yrs onwards (this is to cover the shortfall from CPF life)Also, you want 2,000/month base on today’s value or just in absolute dollars? As you will know, 2,000 in 27 years time is probably going to be worth 1,000 or less. Annuity plans from different companies are probably around 90% the same in their structures and all. Price differences are not huge, so I will not go comparing the plans. The focus should be to build up a strong annuity plan against inflation and again, CPF Life is one of the best annuity we have in Singapore and I will include it in an annuity portfolio.If you are keen to discuss how we can build an inflation resistance annuity portfolio, let me know.0 comments2"
3,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 May 2019Can't get to use your exact configurations as different insurers have different parameters. However, if we are looking at premium term for 20 years and pay out from 55 to 75, guaranteed monthly income $2k without bonuses. You would have to set aside about $13k - $14k per year.My advice is to find out choice of advisor and seat down and tweak with the configurations. And you might want to take bonus into accordance. It wouldn't make sense to take away bonus totally. This is assuming insurers don't make a single cent through the 30 - 40 years investment horizon, which is highly unlikely.0 comments2"
