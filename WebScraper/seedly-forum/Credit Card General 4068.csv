question,"Credit Card General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Jul 2019How are credit card interests calculated?Parents owed $32.10 on non-payment of annual fee because the company rejected the waiver. Was charged $98.60 as ""interest in period"" the following month, which was not inclusive of the owed amount. How is it possible that interest charged in 1 month be more than 300% of what was owed when the applied rate of interest is 2.41% per month or effective interest rate being 28.88% p.a?Credit Card: BOC Sheng Siong Card1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 20 Jul 2019This is pretty nasty. 28% p.a for most credit cards. That's really ridiculous rate and the interest compounds monthly because the fees are charged every month when you do not pay off your credit card debt.
That's excluding all the late charges and additional interest fees.The total amount of interest you are paying:28% p.a interest on your credit card debt (X) you oweAdditional late charges monthly (Y)(X +Y) x 28% p.a will compound agressively and very quickly.Rule of thumb: NEVER get a credit card if you cannot control your spendingAlways pay off your credit card debt monthly in fullDon't be too lazy to waive off your credit card annual fees (this compounds also if you dont pay it off)1 comment0"
2,"Question Poster20 Jul 2019They called the CC hotline and was told that the waiver had been approved so they paid everything excluding the annual fee. In the end they had to go down to a physical storefront to clarify and ended up paying just the fee and got the interest waived. Apparently according to the customer service officer, BOC has been aggressively rejecting annual fee waivers recently."
