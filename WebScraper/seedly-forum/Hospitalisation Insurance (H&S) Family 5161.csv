question,"Hospitalisation Insurance (H&S) Family Asked by Takingstock @Asked on 23 Jun 2019Anyone has any recommendations as to what one should do with the cashback cheques from hospitalization policy payouts?My mum was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer a few months ago. Fortunately, I had bought an NTUC Income H&S policy for her before then.Apparently, we have been keeping costs low by not staying in hospital if not required, and staying in b2 (though her policy covers up to A), and we got cashback for 462.40.I know some of the treatments have been paid with her medisave, and well we have been thinking she could use some cash for cab on the days she is weak / tired. What would you do with the 462?1 answerAnswerBump0"

WonderkidAnswered 3d agoHi Anon,Condolences to your mother and I wish her a speedy recovery.For the cashback of 462 I would keep it as cash for your mum's followup treatments or for items to make her life better such as cab fare like you've mentioned.Cancer is a long journey and hopefully you have implemented an ECI plan to help tide through.All the best for your mum and your family0 comments0"
