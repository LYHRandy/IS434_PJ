question,Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 Nov 2018Surrendering old type of traditional life policy?I have an old traditional life policy which involves paying till you decide to stop / maturity (I.e you pass on). It was bought 3 years ago and yearly premium is 4K. I just got a multiplier life policy that only requires me to pay for 20 years (also 4K). This takes care of coverage much better. Should I cancel the old plan and forgo the premiums paid (use the money that would have been placed there for other investments) OR should I continue to keep the plan and treat it as a savings plan?3 answersAnswerBump0

God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You should keep it unless you can lose 12k and make it back up at a higher % return then when the WL policy reaches your retirement age which I think you would plan on cancelling by based on your phrasing.It's not easy to forgo 12k. And it's also not that easy to earn it back if you're not confident in investing. The WL plan will still give you about a 4% p.a return after 30 years or so. So you can treat it as a long term bond with an upside death benefit. 2 comments2"
2,"Question Poster14 Nov 2018thank you. yes i do intend to cancel it just either now or after 55 (30 years which you rightly mentioned). Im just undecided on whether i should use it for investing in other means or to continue with this. Afterall, its all dependent on the insurance company's performance as well. Hariz Arthur Maloy14 Nov 2018You have to be sure of your confidence in investments. 1 bad year could impact your returns significantly. If let's day you invest 1200 per year every year for the next 30 years. So let's say every 5 year cycle; you earn a 7% return for 3 years, a 10% return on the 4th year, but a 10% drop in your 5th year. Now repeat this 6 times. 30 years have passed, but your compounded return is just 3.6%. A WL plan would have given you the same return if the headache of investing in the market. Because investing also does not mean you make 7-10% return every single year. "

MasterUpdated on 22 Aug 2019You might want to do a comparison on the plans bought and see if it makes sense to keep or to redirect the funds/lost of the insurance.A good way is to do up an excel table and check the benefit illustration, and compare the opportunity cost of putting inside CPF OA (gauranteed 2.5%) since you wish to withdraw it at age 55. or even to meet your FRS instead so that you can draw the remaining money.This will not be an eas decision until you see the figures and analyse the pros and cons.1 comment0"

5,Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You shouldnt treat it as a savings plan. There are probably better ways. I advocate using Term plan which u can have a much larger coverage at a lower premium. The rest of the money could be better invested for higher returns over the long term. Add me on facebook so that I can run some numbers with u. You can better understand this way. I am not an agent or advisor. 2 comments0
6,"Question Poster14 Nov 2018in that case, do you think cancelling or keeping it is a better way since i already have coverage?Yixiong Chang14 Nov 2018I would not be able to tell u whether to cancel or keep. I can only help u review the figures and show u what are the alternatives (opportunity cost), then u can make the decision yourself. Without knowing what are your policies coverage amount and terms, I cannot conclude that you already have sufficient coverage. 
Feel free to contact me on facebook, or anyone else u feel can help u. This issue demands more than just a few lines of explanation, which cannot be fulfilled here. "
