1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Mar 2019There are various ways you can go about doing this. I'll tell you about how I got started:Started by reading local financial blogs. Here are some that I read: https://blog.seedly.sg/http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/http://investmentmoats.com/http://singaporeanstocksinvestor.blogspot.com/https://dollarsandsense.sg/Tried reading some books. http://www.sgbudgetbabe.com/2017/07/recommended-books-on-personal-finance.htmlFrom the above 2 steps, I gained some knowledge; enough to get me started on investing. I also gained valuable lessons (which cost $$$ in terms of my losses) while I was investing.Recently, I signed up for a course that quite a few financial bloggers recommended. The course, even though it was made for beginners, was extremely enlightening for me. It organized the knowledge that I gained over the few years of investing extremely well. I would say that it would benefit me in the long run.So, if you have some money to spare, consider investing in an investment course. It is a shortcut to learning about investing. Of course, if you are not willing, you can always use the 2 points I listed above. They work well too :)0 comments1"
2,"Sylves AngLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 18 Mar 2019Start by researching online what are the various products out there for investment and depending on your own risk behaviour (whether you are risk adverse or high risk taker), select the product which are more suitable for you.For a start, I suggest you can take a look at banks website and understand through their invest options. Some even have a system which can suggest and plan your investment to meet your goals. For e.g: you can start to use OCBC life goals.0 comments1"
