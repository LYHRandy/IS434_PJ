MasterAnswered on 19 Nov 2018It will be prudent to get unless you wish to ""self insure"" meaning to bear the risk of losing with no claims to make for any issues.Personally wouldn't encourage to save that $50 or less unless your total spending for the trip is $300 or less. (which you probably can stomach the lost)0 comments0"
