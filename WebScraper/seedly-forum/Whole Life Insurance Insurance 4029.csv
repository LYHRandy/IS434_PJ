It is also a product which you cannot buy from (after your death/illness) when you want to buy.Its a contract between the insurer and you, when you pay premiums, in the event that you are met with death (or illness depending on the policy wording), a payout is given to protect you/your dependents financially.0 comments0"

Those are the 2 products in life insurance.You pay a premium to an insurer for them to pay a sum assured benefit upon your demise or when you contract a critical illness. This helps you continue generating the income you were supposed to generate if nothing happened to you so that life goes on for your dependants. 0 comments0"

When you think of 'Life' you think of 'Death'There are 3 variants of Life Insurance:Term Life: This is a purely coverage focused product, where all your monthly/yearly premiums go into coverage, so at the end of 65 years old, you are no longer covered and there is no cash component to this. This is what most savvy people recommend because they know how to use the excess cash saved to invest for better returnsWhole Life: This is a mix of coverage product and savings component tied to it, where there is a cash value associated with your policyInvestment Linked Product (ILP): This is a variant of the life policy where they mix in the investment component into coverage. Often with a long lock in period before seeing returnsWhat: In case of death, your family gets paid the total sum assuredRecommended Benchmark: 5 x your yearly income or your existing liabilitiesWhy itâ€™s important: Should increase when you have dependents or more liabilities (e.g loan, kids)You'll get all your answers here: https://blog.seedly.sg/working-adults-what-are-the-key-insurance-policies-you-should-get-in-singapore/0 comments0"

You agree to pay for the policy on a regular basis, and the insurer agrees to pay a sum of money to your beneficiaries if you die. 0 comments0"
