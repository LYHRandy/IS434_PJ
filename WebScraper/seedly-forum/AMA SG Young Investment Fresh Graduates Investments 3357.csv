MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018As long as you have access to your brokerage account online and it'll allow you to manage your portfolio, why not? The thing is to stay invested and not waste the opportunity cost. Only thing is the time zone difference which may be big once you have relocated, e.g if you are relocating to US and you wanna manage your SGX based portfolio. All the best!0 comments2"

5,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 20 Sep 2018Moving permanently or short-term? If permanently, maybe better to wait till settle down & invest from where you are going.​If you are planning to return to Singapore, maybe start researching on which stock broker you want to use. Can do a walk in to one of the Investment centers to check if there are any limitations while you are overseas. I'm sure they can advise you without you having to sign up.​If you just have spare cash that you won't be touching and don't want it to sit in the bank while you're away, and cannot be bothered to constantly monitor the market. Can consider SSB, STI EFT, or just a high interest fixed saving bond. You need a investment account for this. I'm not suggesting topping up your CPF as I'm assuming you want access to it when you return.0 comments0"
