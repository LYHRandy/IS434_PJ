Transferring from OA to SA do help you accumulate more interests and as we know these interests roll over time to a good amount. Also with increasing costs and inflation on yearly basis, interest rolls helps to buffer. I recommend you to do a quick calculation, have enough to support at least the down payment and 3-5years of installments; then transfer the rest to SA. Continue to transfer every JAN to your SA or on monthly basis if you're dilligent.0 comments2"
