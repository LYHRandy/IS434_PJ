GeniusUpdated on 27 Jun 2019Hi OP,At this point in time in which it is implied you have issues paying the premium, I think you would need to answer this question honestly ""Do you think AXA Pulsar is worth it?""The fees you are paying is 5% upfront and 4-5% trailing (2% to the fund and 2% to the platform) while in comparison, you can get the same exposure through an ETF for 0.2% brokerage and 0.5% trailing. While some may point out that AXA Pulsar gives a startup bonus, the fees will eat up most of your gains. Lastly, do note that by going on premium holiday, the account value will fall significantly due to fees and charges which will continue to be charged as per normal and you may not be entitled to loyalty bonuses.0 comments0"
