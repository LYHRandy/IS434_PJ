Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoMiles is better value for money if you like to fly.Unfortunately, for those who prefer cashback (like me), a lot of cashback cards are more on ""regular spending month to month"" than big spend once a mth.Almost all the cashback cards I know of are giving rebates based on x minimum spend for 3 months (or 1 quarter) to reach that tier of cashback.I think the best I heard of Standard Chartered Unlimited Cashback Credit Card for a big spend. 1.5%.I am not a cashback expert, but this is the one I heard about.(Other cashback cards give better rates, but usually, it's based on 3mths spending..)0 comments0"
