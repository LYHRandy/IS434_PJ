There are three types of platinum cards from American Express. 1) The Plat Card (charge card)2) The Plat Reserve (credit) 3) The Plat Credit (credit)The basic privileges of 1 for 1 across dining at selected restaurants are similar across all products. Hence if you really want to use it just for dining, the Plat credit card is good enough.
The differences obviously are the add ons and of course the fees all of which are not waivable for the 1st year. I do know if spend annual about $7500 a year on your credit card, the subsequent year's fee might be waivable. 1) The Plat Card (charge card): $17122) The Plat Reserve (credit) : $5353) The Plat Credit (credit): $321I know Amex does run some campaigns for 1st year free on their Plat Credit Card sometimes. If you pay for the fees, Amex will provide welcome offers that vary from time to time. Generally, the perceived value of the benefits will outweigh the actual cost. You can view the welcome offers on the site: www.americanexpress.com/sg/credit-cards/all-cardsBack to benefits, it really depends if you want to pay the incremental $214 in fees for the reserve, versus the Plat Credit which essentially are:Access to Tower ClubVouchers with 50% for 4 or more at selected restaurants
If you fee those incremental benefits are worth paying the additional fees, then Reserve would be the one to go for. Personally, I'm quite happy with the Platinum Credit - just make sure you spend sufficient to get the fees waived.0 comments0"
