3,"Lewis PohLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 23 Apr 2019If there is a choice, I would say 4 days work week. Whenever I take leave on a Mon/Fri or there is a PH, I feel like I’m forced to be a lot more productive to complete all the tasks. Get more work done => Feels productive/accomplished => Better mental health/happierBut I also think it depends on the actual job requirements. Some requires more time to keep businesses running, like service line.As for commission based employees, I think they wouldn’t consider lesser work weeks since it would mean lesser opportunities for that $$$$0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 28 Apr 2019Rather than provide fixed days how about the concept of “always on” ?In many IT companies, employees do not really have 9-5 work hours. Work and personal life is interconnected so personal life and work take different slices and portions on different days Let’s face it there are days when your work load is lower and if you can spend those hours doing your own errands and work later in the night to cover work wouldn’t that be nice ? The draw back to this concept is the number of hours that you are truly working. It might be more than 9-50 comments0"

I love taking mid week leave so it's like you worked two days, you get a break then work another two days. Helps to break up the accumulated stress level. However it would be great if company is more flexible when it comes to leave taking as most if I understand is a structured day but meetings especially when you're in a MNC doesn't always happen on days you're in the office.0 comments0"

But what we could relook is the hours we spend each day at work. Germany’s (constantly coming up tops as the world’s most productive employees) has a weekly average of 34 working hours, and most companies work by clocking in and out, meaning you can tailor the hours each day a little to better suit your physical and mental health.Singapore lies on the other end of the spectrum with about 44 hours of work a week, and we all know work doesn’t end the minute we step out.1 comment0"
