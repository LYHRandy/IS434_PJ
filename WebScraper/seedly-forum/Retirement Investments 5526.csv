1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Mar 2019If you plan to retire by 40 or 50, you can still do it. You dont have to follow the SIngapore retirement age. Unless you decide to retire later for whatever reason. You can make sure that your investment are less volatile when you are older and nearer to your retirement age. So that you wont have trouble retiring at your target retirement age when market downturn happen close to your target.0 comments0"
