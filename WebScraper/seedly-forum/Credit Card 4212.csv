1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019To your questions,1) Yes, you can pay off before receiving the statement, especially if you know how much you owe.2) Banks nowadays like to ""go green"" so they prefer to send e-statements. If they are late, it is due to working days. Like 15th is a weekend, so they will send on the next working day3) The same applies for paper statements, which will even be longer, taking into account postage time4) Yes, it is normal to wait a few more days. My BOC statement, in paper form, arrive at least 1 week after the statement close date.It all depends on you but as long as you pay the banks before the deadline, they generally don't care when you pay. Problems will only arise if you don't pay or you are late.0 comments0"
