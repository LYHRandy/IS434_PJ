6,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Do both if you can. Service the minimum and grow your investments. Once the latter is of a sufficient size, can consider liquidating some to redeem the outstanding mortgage partially or fully 0 comments0"
7,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018It depends! Are you confident that your investments can yield you more money than the loan interest rate? If not, you should clear off your loans first before starting to invest.​For example, if you have $20k to spare. Your housing loan interest rate is, say, 5% per annum (I dont know the actualy % so i am just using a random number). If your investments yield 4% an annum, you are making a loss and also taking a risk (in terms of stock prices). You'd be better off clearing your loan in this case :)0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Housing loan interest would usually be high and immediate effect than what an ETF may return to you unless you have a 5 figure sum. Thus debts reductions to save on interest is the right way to go for the 2 options here. 0 comments0"
