1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Oct 2018Higher returns tend to run in line with higher risk. The thing you need to ask yourself is how much of a risk appetite you can stomach before you need to cut losses. Generally speaking the safer choices would run the gamut of fixed deposits, higher yielding bank accounts like cimb fast saver and citibank's maxi gain, structured deposits, Singapore savings bonds, ABF Singapore bond index fund (through posb invest saver). Robo advisory portfolio with low risk profiles may also fit in here. Higher risk choices would be straight stock investing, robo advisory portfolio with higher risk profiles, equity Etfs and options portfolio. Typical returns range from about 4% to 40+% or more a year. For non managed portfolios, I'd suggest you find a mentor to teach you to shortcut the learning process. Saves money in the long run and you will be able to achieve your goals much faster. Just ensure there's a track record for the programme. Hope this helps 0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 19 Oct 2018Depending on your risk appetite, you can either try to max out another high yield account, buy ssb, Temasek bond, fixed deposits. The above are low risk products. Higher risk = stocks, high yield bonds. Medium risk = BB+ rated bonds,good quality corp bonds.0 comments0"

If you're willing to take a little risk, you can consider investing in the STI ETF or US ETFs via Robo-advisors. If you prefer safer options, you can consider CIMB FastSaver, Singapore Savings Bonds, Fixed Deposits or the recent Temasek T2023 bond0 comments0"
