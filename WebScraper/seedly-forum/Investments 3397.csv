1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Aug 2018For the 'safest' among what you mentioned, options may be the one. Cos it is still possible to repair the trade if it goes against you. Not exactly the fastest earning but quite consistent, possible to get about 3% or more month on month or so. Don't really need extensive use of charts as well if you know how. 0 comments1"

These are high risk products and require good knowledge of technical analysis for trading.​To learn more about trading:​Two really good books on candlestick charting are:​Japanese Candlesticks Charting Techniques – Steve NissonThe Candlestick Course – Steve NissonYou can find them in the library.​Other good trading books are:​Entries and Exits – Alexander ElderTrading for a Living – Alexander ElderSell and Sell Short – Alexander ElderCome into my Trading Room – Alexander Elder​0 comments0"
