DBS STI ETF is a good start in the sense that you would be ""buying into Singapore economy"" and a decently safe start with moderate risk considering Singapore current market environment.
It's good to see that you are also considering DCA as an approach.
However, for a long term investment, you might want to look into other markets that generate higher returns (S&P 500) or a basket of ETFs that can be easily accessed by you through robo-advisors.Based on historical records (Not reflective of future returns), S&P500 has generated higher returns compared to STI ETFs.I personally still invest in STI ETFs, mainly because of my belief that I will be entrenched in Singapore's economy for a long period :)1 comment1"
