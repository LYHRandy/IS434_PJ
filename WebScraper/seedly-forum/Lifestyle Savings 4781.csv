1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 30 Jun 2019I always believe in value for money. Sure, if I need to get to the airport with large luggage in tow, in the middle of the night, grab/taxi might be worth it for the convenience it brings.If not, it boils down to planning. If you need to be at a place in 1 hr, and it takes 1 hr to get there, then leave now. If you need 30 mins to prepare, then make sure 1.5 hrs before hand you start preparing to leave. Just that simple act of planning ahead will trim down your costs dramatically. Singapore is not a big place, and frankly if your destination is near public transportation, there's really no need to take private hire transport.3 comments6"

WonderkidUpdated on 28 Jun 2019Iâ€™ll try to limit myself to 3 Grab rides for going to work in a week, cutting down to just 1 (purely indulgence for waking up later than usual then GrabHitch to workplace).If this fails, top up a fixed amount (ie. $30 - $50 per month, then use accordingly for Grab rides. Empty GrabPay wallet means no Grab for the rest of the current month).Takes discipline to do this method though.2 comments1"
