How do you do so with the interest rates of the bank encouraging spending?High interest savings accounts generally reward for spending on credit cards.

1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 18 May 2019Yes, I do! I top up my savings accounts to the extent to which I can enjoy the higher interest rates. It's important to see what the cap is for the different savings accounts.Take for example the Citi Maxigain savings account. I currently have my Citi Maxigain savings account topped up to 100k (because beyond 150k, you don't avail the step-up interest of 2%). Currently that gives me the best interest rates with no hassle of minimum spending etc.For the rest, I use Standard Chartered Bonus Savers account (but am not liking the minimum card spend like you mentioned), and the rest I have in CIMB for all the rest of it.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 19 Jan 2019Personally, I placed a portion of my money in another saving accounts which reward me with higher interest if I do not withdraw it as I generally don't spend much.I think it differs from person to person on how should they allocate their money in different accounts depending on their income and average monthly expenses0 comments1"
