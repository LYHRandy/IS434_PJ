1,"Arpita MukherjeeLevel 2. RookieAnswered 5d agoAlbeit there are many non-Singapore ETFs that you can choose from, at Kristal.AI, we have Katalyst.Katalyst which is an actively managed kristal that identifies suitable ETFs across different sectors in the industry and invests to maximize returns while protecting the downside.Â Just so you know, we characterize different strategies as kristals. The Kristal invests to take tactical positions at a more targeted level than traditional style-based investing. It enables investors to acquire a low-cost exposure to popular, growing sectors like technology, healthcare, industrials, consumer discretionary that have been characterised by their solid balance sheets and extraordinary earnings growth. To reap the benefits of some diversification, this kristal also takes some exposure in emerging markets, while any remaining cash is kept invested in short term US treasuries.I work at Kristal.AI, and my mojo is to help people make the right financial decisions. If you think I helped you, do give me ""Thumbs up"". If you think my response was biased let me know, I will work on it.0 comments0"

But if you want to go the ETF route, consider using robo advisories instead. A portfolio will be recommended based on your risk profile0 comments0"
