God of WisdomAnswered on 11 Sep 2019If you're in Quality Assurance and the like, a Lean Six Sigma will help you stand apart from those who don't. However, practical experience counts for more when you are applying for jobs, so don't be too fixated on the certification. Also, if you are going to get it, go all the way to black at least, to show that you are serious on persuing a specialized skill set in this area.0 comments4"
