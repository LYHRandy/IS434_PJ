1,"Marcus GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 19 Jul 2018 Some valuation for you to measure the price of REITs are as follows:1) Price to Book Ratio P/B < 1 is consider undervalued​2) Gearing Ratio Low gearing ratio is good (Pay banks and bondholders a lower amount of interest expenses, which mean there is a higher distribution of earnings back to you as investors)​3) Distribution Per Unit (DPU) Let's say dividend payouts occured semi-annually (twice a year) and your DPU is 0.1, so your annual DPU is ($0.1 * 2) = $0.2.Let's assume the share price of ABC REITs is $3.74. ​So your dividend yield will be (Annual DPU / Share Price)(0.2 / 3.74) * 100 = 5.34%​REITs typically have yield around 5 - 9% but is NOT GUARANTEE!Combined all these and some other valuation with your future outlook of the company, you can make your decision to purchase.​FifthPerson does compile LIVE Daily Updates of Singapore REITs, you can check it out at https://sreit.fifthperson.com/0 comments1"
