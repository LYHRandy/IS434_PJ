Roboinvest also picks the REITS/stocks for you, leaving the research and analysis to the bank's robo setting.Occassionally, the robo will rebalance the portfolio for you.If you pick and purchase multiple REITS yourself, the dividends are credited to your account. You would have to reinvest them yourself. Of course, you can create a similar portfolio as the ocbc robo but you would then need to monitor, research and track the individual stocks/REITS.0 comments2"
