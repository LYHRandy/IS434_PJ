1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019How confident are you of your system that it will succeed? You may want to do a trial run first before plunging into it full time. Ideally your profits should minimally cover your monthly expenses consistently before you fire your boss.0 comments2"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Mar 2019First of all, you must have a sizable capital(which I presume you already have invested in portfolio of stocks), of which a good amount is sitting liquid as cash. Furthermore you must be invested into good news platforms in order to take a postition quickly based off latest market news to ride swings and momentums. That is how I would do things if I were a swing trader.Like what Jonathan said- at the end of the day, it boils down to whether you are confident you can consistently generate returns from your investment strategy.0 comments1"
3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019My opinion is you have to trade in the regions of $100k stock value to even make a decent amount to be a full day trader (for SGX stocks).My best earnings was $600 for a 15 days trade.Most trades would be about $100 to $150 (can be positive or negative).Unless you use leverage. But what if you got margin called? Think about it.0 comments0"
