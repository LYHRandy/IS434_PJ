1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Jan 2019Your portfolio is heavily dependent on financials and reit. Not sure the bought price of your stocks, but beware of the blue chips becoming brusied chips as they become overvalued. STI ETF is also largely finance based consisting of OCBC/DBS/UOB, since you have already bough those stocks why go into the STI ETF? The problem of most cap-weighted ETF is that you will be overweighing overvalued stocks and underweighing undervalued stocks. Maybe consider going into consumer sector.0 comments0"
