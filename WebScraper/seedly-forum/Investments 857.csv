2,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For bonds, you will get back the amount you used to buy the bonds when the bonds mature (in this case it is 10 years), provided the bond issuer (in this case the Singapore government) does not go bankrupt. For STI ETF,  as there is no maturity date as it is unlike bonds, the amount you get when you sell off the units depends entirely on the price of each unit. I.e. you sell them off to the market.1 comment0"
