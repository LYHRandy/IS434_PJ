1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Feb 2019The most important metric when valuating REITs is the NAV (Net Asset Value). The NAV is the market value of its assets net liabilities and dividends. You should look for REITs with a high NAV as this indicates that the REIT has potential for strong earnings and good management. Another metric to consider is the capitalisation rate. The cap rate measures the property yield in other words, the return on investment of a property. Broadly speaking, a high cap rate means the purchase price is low. In terms of a qualitative analysis, the sponsor's relationship with the REIT is an important aspect to consider. Since in Singapore many REITs have a sponsor, that is a company that supports the REIT. Whether the sponsor functions as a property developer or a tenant and whether the sponsor consistently feeds the REIT with cashflow treating it as a partner or simply to maximise returns for the sponsor. The sponsor can maximize returns from the REITs by selling assets at full valuation to make a profit, and throwing assets into the REIT every few quarters. 0 comments1"
