1,"Leo KwekLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 03 Sep 2019Yes, it is legal to extend another 60 days because it is a continuation from the existing lease. If your tenant is a foreigner, the due diligence needed is to check if he/she still have a valid pass.Yes, your right and interest are protected by the law under equity.2 comments1"
