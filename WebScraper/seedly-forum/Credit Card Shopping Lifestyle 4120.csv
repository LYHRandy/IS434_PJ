1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I still prefer Youtrip, for the rates and also the range of currencies they cover. For example, I was just in Laos and while the local money changer did not accept SGD, Youtrip actually supports Laotian kip. I also  used Youtrip on my Japan trip, and found rates to be comparable to what I could get from the Raffles Place money changers. This would probably apply even for shopping in foreign currencies. Another big plus - when I was out of JPY for a transaction, it converted my SGD to JPY. Which also means, no small change that I need to change back to SGD when I get back! For me, that's a nice plus since I typically don't like to change it back to local currency.I don't mind using it as a one-way wallet, because I use Youtrip as an EZ-Link card as well for my local commute!0 comments1"
2,"BLBrian LeeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Though I haven't tried TravelFx, but I do have CIMB visa and Youtrip. I totally agreed with Junus that the exchnage rate by Youtrip is really competitive. Previously I went to JB, though Youtrip does not have Ringgit Malaysia currency, their exchange rate is very close to the money changer in JB. My friend even told me, one time, it's even better than money changer. I also went to Macau few weeks ago and again, the exchange rate definitely beats the airport rate and about the same as money changer. The good thing is that you don't need to change to foreign currencies and if under utilize, you need to change back to SGD.
As Youtrip good for trip, CIMB Visa is best for online. They offer 10% off visa transaction. But do note that recently they change the T&C as of June.0 comments0"
