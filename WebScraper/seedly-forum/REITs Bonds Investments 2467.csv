1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Mar 2019I feel both would be good for an investor looking for passive income. I think the more important question would be how much to allocate within your portfolio, and how to maximise the pros and cons of having these 2 investment products in your portfolio.0 comments1"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Hello! I personally feel that whichever is better will depend entirely up to you. You should see which you are more comfortable in investing in.
I think it is ideal that you research on the pros and cons of each and then proceed to weigh the pros and cons to decide which maybe better for your personal investment strategy.  It may also be good to invest in both as it will help to diversify your portfolio should you invest in both.0 comments0"

1) Bonds: works like loan to a company. When equity goes down, bond increase will go up so you make more from this investment. Choose SSB as it's the safest now. 2) REITS: Company borrow $ to build and manage properties. Good to earn divident from REITS as it is quite attractive. However, when interest rate increases, their cost also increase due to REITS usually borrow a lot of $ to develop and run the property.From this you can see why need both so to cover both ends of the situation when equity up/ down and when interest increase and decrease.  You'll need more than just the above two. Check out more details on how to get a balance portfolio in Seedly blog post.0 comments0"
