question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Oct 2018Hello. Looking at the current market, most of the stocks have fallen. I am thinking if should be buying? I am looking at SGX and i want to be a passive income investor.?I am not sure if it will drop further. Understand from my readings from this blog that there are two views - 1) duration in the market, less regard on point of entry 2) capital gains are important, more regard on point of entry as capital loss could wipe out dividends earned for many years4 answersAnswerBump0"

But Dollar Cost Averaging assumes the stock/index you put into does go up and not stagnate (case in point Japan)2) Capital Gains are important in your early years. Dividend stocks helps to unlock value from the money you invest to fund new opportunities. No matter what, fundamentals are important in business. If it can't sustain, neither the price nor dividend can. Invest in business that can grow and profit to ensure certainty in your dividend income. 0 comments0"

Stock price drops = cheaper, if you fear, maybe you should consider etf instead. If you still fear that the etf price drop, maybe you shouldnt invest in stocks and etfs at all.0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 27 Oct 2018Well, like the saying goes, what matters more is time in the market rather than timing the market.Instead of parking a lump sum in at this point in time, you can consider spliting your investment capital into a few lump sums and take a dollar cost averaging strategy to smooth out your returns.In terms of passive income, it may come in multiple streams, it will be good to consider having some parts of it based on variable income such as Dividends, Bonds etc, and guaranteed income from CPF Life and a retirement plan.Feel free to PM me should you like to find out more.
