Personally my current stashaway portfolio's risk index is 36%. I did not pay much attention to the changes to the portfolio but I believe that the new updates will help make it much more diversified !!Don't worry, as long as you stay invested and continue investing for the next 3-5 to even 10 years down the road, you'll be making money for sure !Good luck on your investing journey !1 comment1"
