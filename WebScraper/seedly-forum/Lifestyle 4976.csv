1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 21 May 2019Fitness First membership. I actually got it for free and am not usually a big gym user, but I do see people use it like country clubs. You literally see them there for a solid few hours, charging phone, getting drinks, and sometimes sitting on an exercise machine watching YouTube.Funny but true.0 comments2"
2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jan 2019I have a Passion Card. The 5 year membership is $12, which works out to be $2.40 per year. It's great for all, not just for people who regularly attend community centre's activities (member price). Discounts available at various merchants island wide, from New Balance to LiHo to Shopee: https://www.passioncard.sg/passion-merchants. There's rebates for Dairy Farm Group companies (7-11, Giant...). So long you save more tha $2.40 per year (isn't that hard), the membership is worth it.0 comments0"
