1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Jun 2018For bank account:​Definitely the CIMB FastSaver which gives you the best flat rate interest at 1% p.a and it is also liquid (ie you can withdraw the amount any time)​You can read the real user reviews here to understand why also: https://seedly.sg/reviews/savings-accounts/cimb-fast-saver​A very simple to use savings account. Designed for the person who is just keen to save up and earn 1% up to the first $50k. Also, many people may not know but actually it is SDIC $50k insured and the CIMB Clicks Online interface is not too shabby as well! Online approval is quick.​For Credit card:​This one really depends on whether you are a Cashback or Miles fan. Both has it's pros and cons.​For Cashback, if you spend above $500 to 700 a month, I would consider the BOC Family Card or SCB Unlimited cashback.​SCB Unlimited cashback:​""Simple no frills 1.5% cashback with an option to use it as an ez-link card. Unfortunately, ez-link convenience fees applies and you don't earn cashback for the ez-link transaction. Also, 1.5% cashback is pretty aweful although there are no cap or no minimum spend. Standard Chartered card promotions are a little hard to come by too.""​BOC Family Card:​""Guys will be relieved to know with the BOC card, there is a smaller hole burnt in their pockets with the 10% rebate for local dining and movie tickets. Of course, there is a cap of $30 per billing cycle (approx $30 expenses); so guys don't indulge your girlfriends too much with the BOC card :P  As for families, there is a 5% rebate for grocery shopping and teleco bills. While the overall rebate cap for expenditures is $100 per month, this is acceptable given that financially prudent individuals are unlikely to spend a large expenditure.z""​For Miles, would recommend either of these two:​CITI Rewards: ​""Best card I have as i get the most rebates or miles out of it. On lazada membership giving lots of rebates for lazada (now 8% rebates), Grab and Chope and RedMart purchases and most miles for most online shopping. I only use this card for the 4x miles return for the above and avoid using it when it gives me less than that equivalent. ""​CITI PremierMiles:​""Sign up for this card during the sign up bonuses with miles.  You get two priority passes to use for airport lounges around the world, however all local spend is at 1.2mpd, which is entry level but not much. You might want to get this card if you are chasing miles because the miles dont expire and you can get 10000 miles if you pay the annual fees of $192. Otherwise, try other cards if you are more into dining or shopping. ""0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 08 Oct 2018Bank Acc wise the best option would be UOB one as it does not require salary credit to access higher interest.​The UoB one card is also good because it does not have fixed spending categorie. Everything gets including into your mind spend of 500 a month(take note of standard exclusions that every bank has)0 comments0"
