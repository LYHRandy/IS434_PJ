1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHi, I would not advise on doing RSP into STI ETF only. There are multiple markets for you to choose from, and RSP can also be done on UTs at zero cost. So unless you have strong reason to believe that the STI will go up like S&P, I would actually go regional or global even. The fees when you RSP can also eat into your returns. I believe your transaction costs are 0.5% each month.Now, about your current paper losses: this is natural. When we are investing, we are exposed to the risks of the markets. Markets go up and down. So most people will only see meaningful returns in the right asset classes over the mid to long run (at least 5 years).I've answered a question on the reasons to RSP recently and you can find it in my profile. Also, I would encourage you to split your budget of $1000 a month over various asset classes. This helps you achieve diversification and a lower weighted average volatility on your investments. You can speak to an independent advisor to find out more about the various options available to retail investors such as yourself, in order to understand the pros and cons, before crafting a strategy to best suit yourself.7 comments7"
2,"See all 7 comments T@Takingstock @2w agoNo offence taken I hope. Its a gd discussion. In my view point, the mgmt fees (although hidden in the final sell price / nav) will still erode returns, hence why managed funds seem to underperform their benchmarks. UTs as a whole could offer a venue for global diversified portfolio, but with the rise of Stashaway and the like that deal in etfs, I am not so sure yet, but I would think the ETFs would prevail over time.Elijah Lee2w agoNo worries. No offence taken. Yes, management fee erodes returns, but what we aim to look for in a UT is a fund manager whose returns justify his fees. If (in a hypothetical scenario) the benchmark makes 7%, the ETF TER charges 0.5%, then nett return to investor is 6.5%. However, if an active fund manager achieves 10% under the same asset class and geography, has a TER of 1.5%, the investor gets 8.5% nett. That's when a manager is worth the fees."

WonderkidAnswered 2w agoHey there, in my opinion, I would still put some money into STI ETF for local exposure because I would still eventually retire in Singapore so I would still believe that Singapore economy will be strong in the future (but who knows!). Nevertheless, I would still diversify by investing in overseas ETF such as those suggested by the ppl before me (e.g. S&P 500 ETF). I would personally go for global ETF with exposure to developed countries economy as they would provide the best diversification. One example is IWDA which I plan to invest in the future once I have the cash. So maybe if I were you, I would consider still putting 500 dollars into OCBC BCIP but I would choose to put the other 500 into IWDA for global exposure!Importantly, you need to be stay invested for the long-term as markets can fluctuate so when you do DCA you can still eventually earn a profit overall. By long term I mean 20 to 30 years down the road till your retirement age. This is just my two cents and there might be better advice and opinions out there! I'm still learning and I learnt greatly from this book called ""Rich by Retirement"" by Joshua Giresch. It's a great book and I hope you can find time to read it if possible!0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered 2w agoHey Anon, if the STI ETF is the only thing you're doing to invest your money, then definitely it isn't a great strategy.The STI is an index that holds the 30 biggest companies in Singapore. It is also heavily concentrated in financials because of the 3 banks in the components of the index.So you're exposed to concentration risk in terms of geography (Singapore very small), Industry (Heavy on financials), and holdings (only 30 stocks).A smarter way to invest is to diversify your investment - globally, across asset classes, without concentrations in any one particular industry.It is natural for investors to have a home bias. Because you live here, there's also no currency risk, you probably see these brands every day, you'd want to invest your money in them. But it has shown that the Singapore economy hasn't been doing too well and in fact, hasn't rebounded past it's market highs back in 2008. In fact, if you held the index 9 years ago, you probably make close to nothing.But even the S&P 500 (the 500+ biggest stocks in the US) also had a lost decade. Where the price of the index at the start of 2000 and start of 2010 was also negative. So invest worldwide, invest regularly, and stay invested when markets go up or down. This would give you a much higher probability of success.2 comments1"
5,NNinja2w agoS&P will become sti etf in ten years. And vice versa for stiHariz Arthur Maloy2w agoNo one truly knows. But I don't have a big confidence on Singapore economy doing extremely well. But S&P 500 can surely go into another lost decade.
6,"MIModel InvestorLevel 2. RookieAnswered 2w agoTbh I will personally never buy into the STI because I see no point in doing so as the STI is very dependent on macro factors. Since you are putting 1k per month into STI, I would rather you channel that same amount into the S&P 500 instead. Either you can DCA into the S&P or lump sum investment in it, the returns over time would definitely outpace the STI.2 comments1"
7,Question Poster2w agoThank You!NNinja2w agoLol sti has decent gains. It’s quite stable and not dependent like you mentioned
8,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered 2w agoLike what the rest has mentioned. It’s too risky to just invest in STI ETF only. You need some global exposure, you can consider IWDA(+EIMI for the emerging markets exposure) or VWRD or VWRA. Reduce the STI ETF amount and buy into one or two of these ETFs. The ratio all depends on your risk appetite. You can read up more online before buying them.0 comments0"
9,"SLSamuel Lee, Financial Planner at Advisor Alliance Group (AIA)Level 3. WonderkidAnswered 2w agoHi,$1000 a month is a rather substantial amount if that is all you are budgeting for your investment.Contrary to popular belief, investing into STI ETF is not as diversified as you would like to think it is. A layman way of explaining it would be that you are ""buying into Singapore's economy""With the recent factors worldwide (US-China Trade war), it is normal for the STI ETF to be making a loss. Do note that when investing - you are bound to be exposed to risk and potential loss of capital. If you are not comfortable with that, you may want to consider instruments with lower risk: Bonds, CPF, Endowments for example.Do speak to a trusted financial advisor if you wish to diversify your portfolio. Meanwhile, feel free to DM me if you have any questions!1 comment0"
