God of WisdomUpdated on 20 Sep 2019Hey Anon, Lupus is one of the 37 Standardized Critical Illness definitions as provided by the Life Insurance Association and is covered in your CI policies and riders.To add on, Lupus has an early and intermediate definition as shown below. To claim for these 2 definitions, you'll need an Early Critical Illness policy. ECI policies also cover late stage CI.You can purchase this as a standalone CI term product or as a rider on a term or whole life policy.But do read the definitions closely because for late-stage it only covers from Stage 3 to 5. And for early and intermediate stage, there are also some specifications.4 comments4"
2,"See all 4 comments Elijah Lee21 Sep 2019I just want to add on a little here about my own experience helping a client. I have tried to get CI cover for a client with lupus as a pre-existing, but was basically told that it would be a decline case. Lupus, as an auto immune disease, basically means your immune system is prone to attacking yourself. So if one already has lupus, it is unfortunately impossible to get cover (maybe in future with medical advances, things will change).
