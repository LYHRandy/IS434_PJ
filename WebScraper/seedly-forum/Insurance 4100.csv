Perhaps you can share the hospitalisation plan that you are referring to / check your policy document / call up your insurance agent.​Also, the hospital will do an e-filling / e-claim for you if you are warded for at least 8 hours so no worries if you are unsure about the claim eligibility / procedures :)​0 comments1"

Under your H&S scheme you will be able to claim this because you are warded (for at least a night).​My experience with this is two situations:​Situation 1: I almost had a leg fracture and went to Mount Alvernia hostpital for a CT scan on my ankle.​Turns out that it was not a ankle fracture but more of bruising so the doctor just sent me home.​This was covered under my PERSONAL ACCIDENT (PA) Policy as it was a 'accident' and not a 'hospitalisation', i got sent home immediately.​Situation 2: I had a nose operation and was warded for 2 nights as I got under the knife to remove a blockage​This one was clearly under my private HOSPITALISATION policy because I was warded and underwent surgery.​Yup those were two of the situations I encountered :) All the best in yours! If not, always call in to ask your insurer as well, that is the best way to know pertaining your policy (or if your agent is still around.0 comments0"
