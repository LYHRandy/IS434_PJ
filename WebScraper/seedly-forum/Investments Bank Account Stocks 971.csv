1,"Elijah LeeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 30 Jun 2019To buy shares that are trading on SGX, you need to open a CDP account and a trading account with a brokerage firm, and link the trading account to your CDP account. Once those are open, you may proceed to buy shares. Costs that are incurred would include brokerage charges, plus Clearing Fees of 0.0325%, SGX Trading Fee of 0.0075% on the gross contract amount & SGX Settlement Instruction FeeÂ of SGD0.35 per settlement. The whole cost is then further subject to GST of 7%.2 comments6"
2,"EEva30 Jun 2019With so many fees and charges, is there any recommended figure if we want to buy shares or stocks?Elijah Lee30 Jun 2019You would want to ensure your cost of investing is low. Usually for shares, I would recommend having a cost of less than 1% or lower. You cannot avoid brokerage charges on shares but for unit trusts, look for zero sales charge."
