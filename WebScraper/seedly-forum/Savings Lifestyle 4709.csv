question,"Savings Lifestyle Asked by Raimi JasmanAsked on 13 Aug 2019Using $8k out of my $18k emergency fund, is this okay?I have saved up $18k for my emergency fund, aka my other deposit account, which I keep my savings or whatever account you call it. However, I have decided to use a sum totalling to $8k this year on pampering myself. It was basically for enjoying my life, taking short trips to JB and Batam.2 answersAnswerBump0"

Do you feel $10k is sufficient for emergencies? If you do then maybe that's sufficient enough to keep. $8k to splurge on travelling regionally does seem quite abit though, maybe you're staying quality hotels or something =)I've an alternative to suggest to you, something which I've posted on Seedly before. I'd recommend to reconsider if emergency savings is really a flawed concept. What if you want to seriously grow your wealth? Maybe an opportunity savings would help you more instead?

MasterAnswered on 13 Aug 2019To be honest, it is a rather personal/subjective question that no one can answer perfectly.If you want to take out the money to pamper yourself, that is fine. If you don't want, that is fine too.Life is short and unpredictable. Do whatever makes you happy is what I believe in.Cheers.0 comments1"
