1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Global ETF gives more diversification than US ETF. But IWDA already hold companies in CSPX so buying CSPX will result in overlap. You can still choose both if you favor the US market more but wants a bit of diversification with CSPX but have to take the overlap into consideration.2 comments0"
2,Donald Kieran Ang09 Apr 2019Im holding a 6 idigit portfolio mainly in SG REITS. Do you think i should liquidate all and put them in IWDA and perhaps MCHI (China) ?Nicholes Wong09 Apr 2019It really depends on you. Buying IWDA is kind of like a hands off approach where you just invest for the long term without thinking about the market. Im not too sure about china but you should take a look at iShares CSI 300 ETF (2846) at HKEX as they seem to have better expense ratio. You dont have liquidate everything in REITs as they are still a pretty good investments. Maybe you can split some REITs and some IWDA depends on which you favor more.
