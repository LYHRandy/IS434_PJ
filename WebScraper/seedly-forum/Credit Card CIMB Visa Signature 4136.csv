2,TWTay WenHaoLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi. Im also looking for a replacement. Seems like CIMB really offered a good deal of 10%. Cant seem to find anything thats close to it.My best alternative so far is UOB ONE @ 5% for $2000/mth (quite hard to reach but should be okay if I include all my household bills: utilities and telco etc)I'm also using DBS Livefresh currently for paywaves/online. Also 5% (min $600)Hope to hear better alternatives from others too1 comment1
3,"R.Rasyad .12 May 2019That's true, nothing in the market is as attractive as the previous CIMB Visa signature, in regards to its minimum spend and categories, for cashback.

Maybe it's time to look into reward-based credit cards, since most don't have the minimum spend criteria."
