Get WL with Early-stage critical riders to protect yourself in case of critical illness.
if I'm telling my 20-year-old self, would be learn driving, don’t give excuses on choosing career over starting a family or vice versa (this one didn’t happen to me but I see it all around me). Partying on weekends is overrated, drinking in pubs where you can have a conversation is better.Drink Lagavulin instead of Laphroaighave a real hobbycut your social media time in halfbuild your clothes properly and don’t Fall for those cheap-made-expensive-again brands like Fila/championWhen I was 19, I wore a Fila shoe and people laughed because it wasn’t Nike Air max.0 comments0"

Disregard for now the fact that you're covered under the SAF plans, you won't be forever.At the same time, continue to save in a disciplined manner - to do anything meaningful you'll need to have a basic amount of funds available first. Also, your investments in BTC and FS are considered fairly high risk in the grand scheme of things so you'll need to balance that out.You've got age on your side so capitalise on that. Keep your eye on the prize :) (but first you gotta determine what your prize is).0 comments0"
4,"KAKhairudin AliLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 22 Sep 2019Build up your emergency funds. Rule of thumb is to have 3 to 6 months of your gross monthly income. You may want to keep that in a high interest-paying account or SSB account. The key is to have it accessible when time in need.

That should be your priority for now. Ask again when you finish that first task.

Peace. Good luck.0 comments0"
