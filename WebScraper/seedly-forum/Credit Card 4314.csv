1,"Amanda PhuaLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 01 Jul 2018Hi there, I feel that your decision depends on your expenditure and spending habits. While benefits from most credit cards include cashback or rebate, certain cards provide rewards for transactions made at specific outlets. Also,  in order to be eligible for student credit cards, you have to be enrolled in eligible universities to qualify. If you’re enrolled in a private institution, your options are limited.  Another point to note is whether you are able to control your spending. Otherwise, it will be better for you to stick to debit card.Some links that might help:

Grand MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Experience.Get used to buying and paying in credit and get used to paying back this credit card bill in time.And if you make mistakes and incurred late fees, interest rate, extra debt, GOOD.At least you incurred it early in life where the amount of credit available to you is small.You can learn how to waive off membership fees, late fees, how to recover from debts, etc.LEARN how to manage credit card. This is a big advantage.0 comments1"
3,Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Jun 2018Apply for only one student credit card if you have to - the only reason would be to enjoy promotions relevant to these cards especially for celebrations etc.​I would not encourage you to apply for one as I believe there are other alternatives to getting promos such as using app like eatigo and the fact that as a student you may not be able to pay off the owed sum (plus the temptation part to use the card..) though.0 comments1

MasterAnswered on 29 Jun 2018I personally have used a student credit card (was using Citibank Clear Card) and here is my thoughts..​Benefit of using student credit cardsYou get to enjoy promotions and deals exclusive to that credit cardYou get to earn credit card points (Clear Card has it) whenever you spendYou get to pay only when the credit card bill is dueHowever, there's also danger of using a credit card as a student:You may forget to pay your bill (which is bad as interest will kick in)You may overspend and not able to pay the credit card bill (which is bad as interest will kick in)​Hope that helps!0 comments1"

You can consider that if your total spending is about 400 ​if not why not try and ask your parents to give you a sub card ? 0 comments0"
