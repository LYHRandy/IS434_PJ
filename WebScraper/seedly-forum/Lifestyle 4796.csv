MasterUpdated on 19 Jun 2019其实世界上有三种人先知先觉后知后觉不知不觉先知先觉The coach knew tt money can come in fast for certain seasons n products.They also knew there are off peak seasons tt drys out profit if any.So they take in students to make money from them and show them the good seasons.后知后觉 if the HARDWORKING students are heng in some ways, they make money back from the course but with their hard work. The income might not be consistent.Most of the time, they dun make back the course fee and any failure is bcos the HARDWORKING students got problems....not true really.不知不觉 Lastly, the LAZY student who wanna be spoon feed will confirm lose money bcos their intellectual is not meant to learn but to leech.0 comments2"
2,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered on 14 Jun 2019Its not a scam. Its very authentic.Disclaimer:- I attended different ecommerce courses before, both local and USA markets.You are not going to get rich just by attending the course. There are a lot of thinking, planning and hardwork to get to the passive income stage (meaning your company has many staff running the operations).If you refuse to attend such courses, you can learn on your own, via googling, via youtube learning, via checking with the platform guides (Qoo10, Lazada, Amazon all have self-help guide), you can definitely do it on your own.What the course can do for you is to cut short this learning curve by a lot. Some pple may take 6months, some may take 2 years etc. These courses usually help by summarising what does not work (via their experience) and what works to you so you can save the trouble, the time, and usually the money.I have learnt from https://decisivemarketer.com/ and also a free group  https://www.facebook.com/groups/158010781507949/
Both paid and free provides different varying level of support. Did I make back the money i paid to my mentor? Of course. It was a long struggle without going through the paid course, and I am glad I gave up learning on my own and seek help. Even with the paid course material, i still need time and effort to slowly apply and scale up my business.Do learn if you can afford the time and money. but do not think its a get-rich-scheme. You need to work hard!0 comments2"
