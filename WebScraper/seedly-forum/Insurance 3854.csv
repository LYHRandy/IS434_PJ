question,Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 20 Apr 2019Anyone ever used Aetna international insurance? Not heard much about them and wanted to know their service and payouts. We are currently with AIA PROHealth and find them good but since it doesn't cover pre existing conditions (very minor problems) we were hoping Aetna might.1 answerAnswerBump0
