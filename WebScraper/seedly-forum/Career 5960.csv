1,"Willy TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 09 Oct 2018You need professional industry experience and you should preferably at least have a relevant bachelors degree (if teaching diploma) or higher. ​You need to apply with the various polytechnics direct. Unfortunately, most poly and uni are under a hiring freeze at the moment so unless you’re really good...it’s not going to be easy. ​Of course, that being said, there are industries where lecturers are lacking. ​Spruce up your resume and cover letter?0 comments1"
