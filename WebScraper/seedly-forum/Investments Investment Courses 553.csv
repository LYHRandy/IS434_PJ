1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Sep 2019This is an extremely tough question to answer. You may want to start with the Fifth Person dividend investing, or attend my event  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/investment-regrets-read-this-before-your-next-investment-tickets-6982034152 first, then decide further.But generally, value is what you perceived and able to get. What is $3,000 to you if you can profit after attending the course within a few months?
What is $100 if it brings you no knowledge?You may wish to revisit what you mean by value.0 comments0"
