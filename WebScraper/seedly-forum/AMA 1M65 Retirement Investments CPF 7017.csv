MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018I am not sure if the CPF is the best in the world (because I am not familiar with the rest of the other plans), but I believe it is the best we can find in Singapore. The only thing I think it can do better is to make the scheme less complicated and let more people appreciate how good the scheme. Many Singaporeans are not having a good opinion of CPF because they do not understand all the CPF schemes available. Once you understand the schemes, you will find that it will not only enable you to be ready for retirement, but also possibly to become rich. That my personal opinion. 0 comments3"
