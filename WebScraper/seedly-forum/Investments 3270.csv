1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 2018No. With all the taxes and duties in place. With very competitive offer by others and thus there's more landlords than tenant. It's not a good investment instruments anymore unless you're Singapore citizen and this is your first property. Otherwise , there are much better investment instruments. 0 comments1"
2,"Choon Yuan ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 16 Sep 2018In this question's context, I will equate real estate to residential and comemrcial.â€‹Most of such real estate demand is tied to one factor - population growth. If there are more people on this island, this means demand for real estate will grow. And for real estate prices to increase, it has to outstrip supply (which is growing by 2% annually). Hence, it is down to your view if the government will keep increasing the population by more than 2% annually by letting in more foreigners. As of now, the government has a rather lax immigration policy which grows the population by 1% annually. 0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018With the relatively recent additional duties in place, it's a lot more expensive now. Plus there's no guarantee you'll be able to find a tenant for rental if that's your intention. As Gabriel mentioned as well, rising interest rates may impact your mortgage loan repayments.  Have you considered investing into a portfolio of reits instead? It flows along the same concept, plus the dividend yield can be potentially higher than property rental yield. 0 comments1"
