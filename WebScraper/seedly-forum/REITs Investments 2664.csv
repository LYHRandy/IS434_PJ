1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Feb 2019Hi there! Mapletree REITs are often considered ""defensive"" stocks due as it is a buffer to the rising interest rates. 2 out of 4 of DBS's top ""buy"" REIT picks are from the Mapletree Group, Mapletree Logistic Trust (SGX:M44U) and Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (SGX:RWOU). The Mapletree Logistic Trust (MLT) reported a solid quarter (sept 2018) with strong numbers, where gross revenue grew by 13.8%, NPI increased by 14.6% and DPU improved by 3.8%. MLT has been on an acquisition spree over 2018 thus providing inorganic growth opportunities for the trust in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Australia. Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (NAC) is expected to show stable income and lengthening of portfolio due to its recent acquisition of commercial properties in Japan. This expansion to Japan provides further inorganic growth opportunities. Additionally, the REIT is facing an upcoming expiration of several anchor tenants (in Festival Walk, Hong kong) where the REIT will be able to adjust rental rates. One point to note is that the growth rate for NAC has been slow however, its growth is steady. The other two Mapletree group REITs are the Mapletree Industrial Trust (SGX:ME8U) and Mapletree Commercial Trust (SGX:N2IU). Maple Industrial Trust is looking to expand and grow its overseas data centre exposure to 20% of assets, twice of its current exposure. The Mapletree Commercial Trust (CapitaCom) focused on real estate office sector currently has the second highest market capitalization and analysts are expected the REIT to gain momentum in 2019. The Mapletree group REITs currently has an average dividend yield of 6.3% and all four REITs consistently report YoY growth in NPI. Personally, I feel that the Mapletree Group REITs have a strong management team which is essential in any REITs. Additionally, Mapletree has ties with Temasek, allowing for greater knowledge and synergies in the real estate industry. 0 comments1"
2,"Gibson JunxunLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 Feb 2019I would consider it a good buy but given the current high market valuation of REITS, itâ€˜ll be a good choice to enter once valuation drop. Stable management with a very strong sponsor backing them, good to hold for long term for dividend but definitely not a growth stock.0 comments0"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Feb 2019I'm personally vested in MLT, MNAC, and was also vested in MCT before I decided to sell off at the price I thought it was fairly valued. Will look to go back in once the price has dropped Strong reits for sure, backed by indirect owner Temasek and they continue to deliver growth. But at current levels they may be a bit expensive, except for MNAC and MLT. Currently doing dca into the latter counter and plan to liquidate if it gets above a certain threshold, unless more yield and dpu accretive properties are acquired 0 comments0"
