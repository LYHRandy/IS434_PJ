1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 25 Aug 2019Don't look at the premiums. Look at the coverage amount and length. If you make 2k a month, you should be covering yourself for about 120k as income protection in the event of critical illness.If you're purchasing this for Whole Of Life and paying for 25 years, your premiums would be about $1,550/yr. If you're getting 150k cover, that'll be around $1,910/yr for 25 years.Adding on an Accident Plan, that'll be about an extra $20+ a month. Your hospitalisation plan would be $300/yr by cash. So all in all, around $175-$200/mth is more than sufficient.You wouldn't need that much more cover until you start earning more or start having more liabilities/dependents.1 comment4"

3,Alan KorLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 26 Aug 2019What is your purpose of buying life insurance? Do you have dependents?How about an accident plan? Do you lead a hazardous lifestyle?What do you know about hospitalisation plans?Would rather you know and understand the rationale before you look at the costs.2 comments2
4,"Question Poster27 Aug 2019For accident plan, it doesn’t necessarily involve me living a hazardously. Some accident plans cover food poisoning as well as insect bites (I am actually allergic to sandfly and bed bug bites). In the long term, I believe that it can ensure that I am not blowing so much money on treatment out of my own pocket. 

I’ve been reading up on insurance for a while as I would like to take more ownership of my well being. Rest assured I am not diving into this recklessly.Alan Kor26 Aug 2019Yes, if you believe that accident plan could benefit you much more because of your allergy, by all means pls get the plan to ensure peace of mind and money

yup, good to understand and learn more to take ownership and responsibility of your insurance coverage"
5,"EEvelynLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 07 Sep 2019Kudos for making the effort and initiative of considering buying insurance at 20! I bought my first one around 21 and it wasn’t a good buy (it’s an ILP unfortunately) but on the other hand, it’s good because it is the only one without loading or exclusions because later I have some health issues. I think 10% is okay if you have worked out the sums where you have comfortable amounts for your own eating, transport, emergency funds savings (6 months at least), parents allowance if you need to give, or any study loans. I think that’s what I had to pay at the age of 21. Make verrrrrry sure you’ve some cash with you just in case of any emergency happens, because the last thing you wanna do is to cancel the policies due to inability to pay! It’s the worst, I can tell you!At the same time, I also would like to advise you to reconsider what you would like to buy. I would agree that hospitalisation plan is good to have! As for accident and life insurance, I’m not too sure, in fact, I have just cancelled my accident plan (because I don’t think it’s necessary). Life insurance would be good if you have dependents if I’m not wrong, so you might wanna consider term insurance because it’s less of premiums which is less taxing on your income? ECI, CI and TPD are lump-sum payouts and may or may not happen (to fit into the requirements for a payout), so you might want to also consider DII (disability income insurance) which is less popular in Singapore (note that it’s not because it’s lousy, but not so profitable for the agents who are selling - according to a Friend who is an agent). Hope that helps!0 comments0"

7,"Jacqueline Yan02 Sep 2019Hi there! It's me again from the Seedly team. :) 

It'll be great if you could elaborate more on the basics and minimising cashflow stress in your answers too as it'd help the other users gather information faster.

Thank you for sharing the article and have an awesome day!Thelobang Thelobang03 Sep 2019Thanks Jacqueline. ""minimise cashflow stress"" = spend as little as possible of your monthly take home salary on insurance and yet get a high level of basic protection, before considering to spend on more complex type of insurance coverage."
8,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 01 Sep 2019In a straightforward fashion, I will say no. 10% looks fine to me.For the budget that you mention, you should be able to easily get your self an accident plan, death/TPD/TI/ECI coverage of at least 5 times of your annual income.0 comments0"
9,"Megan Tan, Financial consultant at PrudentialLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 28 Aug 2019As a general guideline, an allocation of 20% for insurance/long term savings is the max I'll recommend for a healthy cashflow usually. Do hit me up if there's anything else I can help you with. :)0 comments0"
10,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Aug 2019I agree with both Hariz and Alan.To further emphasis, that 10% of income is a guideline, and quite a hard guideline because anything more can be detrimental to your cash flow, especially if some life events hit you, and not even insurance can help you financially.That's why we try to mix in term insurance, to cover gaps due to affordability. No need to worry too much about the IRR yield in terms of term insurance. Do read up Mindef Aviva for your future top-up for death coverage.0 comments0"
