Invest in your financial literacy.Read investment books, and/or attend investment courses (most aren't value-for-money / too costly for too basic content, please read my reviews for the ones I recommend, or read the reviews on Seedly to find out more sentiments).

They're affected by economic cycles and can be cyclical, so it is never a good idea to put all my wealth in a single basket. Wouldn't want a single fall to break all my precious golden eggs!0 comments1"
2,Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018Do your homework first. Understand your risk profile. Choose the instruments that suit your profile. Invest in 100% reits is not viable in a rising interest rate environment. Diversification in different markets using different instruments is more viable. 0 comments0

It would be good to spread out the investments into different buckets in case of down trends.​on the flip side if you have holding power then the down trends would not likely be a huge worry given that you have invested in sound REITS0 comments0"

5,"Leong Wen FongLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Aug 2018Hello! Good question! It's always important to split your money into your expenses, savings, and investment! Make sure you save for a rainy day, in case you suddenly need a sum of money! ​I'm not too sure about REITS, perhaps a fellow member can give you a clearer picture, but perhaps its not the best idea to place all your eggs in one basket!0 comments0"
