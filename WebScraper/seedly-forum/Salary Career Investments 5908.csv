WonderkidUpdated on 24 Nov 2018Time for u to learn about finance management.. with no investment knowledge and little savings.. is best for u to evaluate the following too:1) find a higher bank account with better interest rate. As u need to set a side some emergency funds that is liquid for u to pull out just in case of emergency(e.g. unexpected medical fee, etc)2) have u bought ur insurance such as hospitalization and critical illness yet? Is best to buy some of this health related insurance.. especially u r a freelancer3) start learning the basis of investment.. from what is bonds, reits, etf.. etc.. the last thing u want to do is invest in something that u don't know.. or just becos someone recommend u this investment product over the counter.. U can attend some free or cheap lessons offered by sgx, dbs vickers, etc..0 comments0"

4,"Tim NgLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 24 Nov 2018Agree with YT, you allocate a portion to save and put it in Singapore Savings Bond (SSB). If you want to invest, a good advice is to invest money you don't plan to withdraw for the next 5-10 years. Markets are looking choppy right now. Another method is to put all in SSB and withdraw a fixed amount every month. That way, your money can grow at 1.8ish%PA and still can enjoy the liquidity of SSB. 0 comments0"
