Paying an advisor will cost more but since you're asking a question like this, it may good to pay for that advice to help you with your investment decisions.0 comments3"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 14 Jul 2019Roboadvisors have lower costs, but returns wise can't say which one is better. Stashaway puts money in US market, so you'll be exposed to exchange rate risks. STI ETF is locally and more comfortable if you want an investment in tune with your living environment.Although for children's education I won't risk my money in investments where the capital isn't guaranteed - just my 3 cents' worth of thoughts.2 comments1"
