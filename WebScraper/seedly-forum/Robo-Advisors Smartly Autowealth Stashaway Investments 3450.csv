2,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Jun 2018Hi, I would recommend StashAway since it charges the lowest fees (0.8%) for investments under S$10k. Also, they have a mobile applicaiton so it makes it easier for you to monitor your portfolio anytime. Smartly charges 1% for investments under S$10k while AutoWeatlh charges a flat 0.5% + 18 USD, take note that AutoWeatlh requires a minimum of S$3000 to get started. Please refer to this article from Seedly for a comparison between the 3 robo-advisors - https://blog.seedly.sg/singapore-robo-advisor-investment-comparison/​0 comments1"
