question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 15 Oct 2018I have questions on Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA). If i do it every 6 months, does it mean the units i received will be determined by the price of the purchased stock?For example if I buy 1000 units at $1 in jan and buy 666 units at $1.5 in June and buy 1250 units at $0.8 in Dec. Is it better to dollar cost or to buy large units when price of valuation is low?3 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomUpdated on 15 Oct 2018Since you won't know what future prices will be, but confident that markets tend to rise with time, you DCA to take the guesswork out of when to buy and predict if its a good time to enter, but to keep buying no matter what, so as to remain invested in the market.Because time in the market is better than timing the market.And yes, place the same amount of money each time, thus you'll buy lesser units when price is higher and more units when it's cheaper. 0 comments3"

If you do it 1x every 6 months only it will take you 30 years to average out when you can otherwise do in 5 years.Ideally it is better to buy more when price is low and not buy at other times. But dca is premised on the very reasonable assumption that you cannot guess the right time to buy every single time. So u sacrifice a bit of returns for slightly better certainty.However pls note DCA does NOT eliminate risk entirely. If you invest in a single bad stock (hyflux) dca will not save you from losing all your capital when the share price collapses. So do diversify as well.0 comments1"
