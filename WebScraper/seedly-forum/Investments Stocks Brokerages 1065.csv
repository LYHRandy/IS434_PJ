Google Interactive Broker Money Mind Forum for a comprehensive thread on it.I do not understand the fuss about IB's minimum $10 per month.1 ) You do a single trade with most SG brokers, they charge minimum $10. So if you think IB's $10 suck, don't trade SG brokers2) $10 is minimum. If I incurred a trade of $8, IG will add on $2 to round up for that month. If I do $15 of trades, no extra fees.3) Forex rate. And you need the local currency to buy the local stuff so you suffer in forex for SG brokers... i believe an amount of $10,000 you will already paid more than difference of $100 from SGD to USD because of the unfavourable forex in all broker.The forex rates in IB is remarkably close to spot rate.4) Many brokers charge you custodian fees for keeping USA or other overseas stock. None for IB5) If you have stocks, IB can even borrow your stocks and provide you with interests. Extra returns that is not possible in most small brokers.6) Most importantly - variety. I have never met any broker that has more options than IB, and I have many broker accounts.Disclaimer: IB does not pay me to write this.3 comments3"

Sorry, not sure which broker can be better to DCA. I am using IB to DCA in USA stock markets though. :)Tan Wei Ming04 Jun 2019May I know whether cost incurred when exchanging SGD for USD is counted into the commission US$10?"

On the other hand, Interactive Brokers mininum commission is US$1, they will die die still want to earn from you US$10 each month.Thus, I will go for SAXO for US market. Edit: If you do many trades in a month then I guess Interactive Brokers will be better. As for SG shares, I will go for DBS Vickers cash upfront account. Minimum commission is $10 or 0.12% whichever is higher. The best thing about this is that all your shares are in CDP! If you want to sell, I recommend opening an account with FSMone and link the CDP account with FSM so that you can sell at $10 or 0.08% whichever is higher.0 comments3"

WizardAnswered on 03 Jun 2019Other than MIP, you can use a regular brokerage platform to buy/sell shares in those markets.There would be commission charges and you need to manually buy/sell those shares unlike the MIP which is partly automated.0 comments1"
