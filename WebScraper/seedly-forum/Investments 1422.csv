1,"Cassandra ThoLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 16 May 2019P2P Versus Real estate Hello, I’m Cassandra, the Community Engagement Manager for CoAssets Pte Ltd (CoAssets).While there is no one “best form” of passive investment, I personally define “best” as the highest level of risk an individual is able to tolerate. As every individual risk tolerance differs, it would be dependent on the following factors: Interest rates, default rates, effort required and simplicity of the investment.Since CoAssets provides a P2P platform, I could help by giving a brief overview of how P2P platforms work.Firstly, P2P platforms main focus is to match investors (lenders) to businesses (borrowers).  Returns of investments differ for different projects/P2P platforms. In 2018, the weighted average returns are as shown:Minterest: 3.5-24% (Weighted ave: 12.95%)CoAssets: 9-10% (Weighted Ave: 9.91%)Moolahsense 5.90%-16.82% (Weighted Ave: 9.9%)Funding Societies: 6.51-17.79% (Weighted Ave: 9.32%)SeedIn: 7-20% (Weighted Ave: 8.33%)That said, some would consider P2P investments as high risks and is not for everyone. However it is a new financial product that investors can consider including in their investment portfolio.Real Estate Moving on, investing in real estate has always been popular amongst Singaporeans.
Monthly passive income is generated when a property is successfully rented out. While property investing is the “investment of choice“ for most Singaporeans, it has gotten harder in recent times due to loan restrictions and additional taxes. As a result of these, Singapore’s property market is not as vibrant as before.https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-worlds-second-most-expensive-housing-market-cbre-report https://sbr.com.sg/residential-property/news/chart-day-singapores-property-returns-poised-beat-us-and-uk As the headwinds for property investing grows, it may be timely for investors to explore alternative investment products.With all these information, P2P could be a viable alternative for real estate investors who are looking to diversify their investment. As Benjamin Graham once said “successful investing is about managing risks, not avoiding it”. Hopefully all these information will help reader manage risks better! :)0 comments8"

3,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 May 2019There is no such thing as a best form of passive investment. What works for you may not work for others, and vice versa.Instead, understand your risk profile and what kind of returns you are looking at. When we mention passive, its not entirely true that you just put your money out there and let it grow. Rather it means lesser upkeep in terms of time and effort because you are paying someone to do it for you.Some options that are considered more passive are: 1) Investing in ETFs through a Dollar Cost Averaging Approach - You could either do it on your own via a broker, or take advantage of robo-advisers2) Investment Plans from Financial Advisors like myself - We assist you in managing your portfolio and aim to seek returns that meet your risk profileOther options such as REITS or Stock Investing would require more knowledge on your end and more active understanding of the market. At the end of the day, it matters on how comfortable you are letting others (be it robo or financial advisors or bankers) manage your portfolio.If you would like to find out more about how I assist my clients in building a globally diversified portfolio.

4,"Ashley Wong, Financial Assistant at Multi Management & Future SolutionsLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 02 May 2019For me, the best form of passive investment is dividend stocks investing. You are effectively paid to own these dividend stocks as long as company is earning profits. These dividend stocks can be used to repurchase additional shares or can be received as a cash payment. Dividend stock investing is also considered as one of the best ways to generate retirement income.0 comments0"
