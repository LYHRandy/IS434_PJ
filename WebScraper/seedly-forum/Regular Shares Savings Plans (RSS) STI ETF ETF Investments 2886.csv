1,Adam YamLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I asked myself this question a year ago but there was no affordable option to my knowledge then. Today I use interactive brokers to purchase overseas ETFs as it's much more affordable than local brokerages. You can DCA into a few overseas ETFs each month using this platform. The cost is so low ($1 per trade?) that you'd probably be paying the minimum $10 a month charge. 3 comments4

3,"Ivan GuanLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I suggest you just RSP into infinity S&P 500 index fund. There is no upfront fee or platform fee if you use poems onlineYou don't have to convert SGD to USDHaving said that, a lot of US investing concepts don't apply to Singaporeans. RSP into ETFs don't guarantee returns. 4 comments1"

Just found this out :) Thanks!Jonathan Chia Guangrong24 Jan 2019Well, to me, converting to USD is something I need to live with as my main port is based in the US. Points 2, 3 and 4 are a bit moot to me, as brokerage charges are very little (min 5 bucks for me) and SPY's volume would usually reflect tight spreads and ease of execution. Point 4 can be overcome through selling naked puts to gain premiums and purchase the Etf at a discounted price. Point 5, I agree it can be a sore point. But if you are buying into SPY for dividends, it won't really make sense as it is not an aristocrat. "
5,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 17 Jan 2019SPY would be a popular and highly liquid ETF for the S&P500, and quite cheap at 0.09% fees a year. That said, there is really no automatic way to dca into this or any specific Etf on a monthly basis. You will need to manually make the purchase through platforms like Td Ameritrade or interactive brokers. Avoid the local brokers as mentioned by Adam below as the fees are not worth it. Alternatively you can consider the robo advisory platforms but you won't be able to choose your Etf as it's portfolio based. Hope this helps 0 comments1"
