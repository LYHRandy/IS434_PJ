God of WisdomAnswered on 10 Oct 2018TDSR - Total Debt Servicing Ratio​The maximum debt you can take on as a percentage of your income.​Not more than 60% of your income can be used to pay debt. Mortgage, Loans, etc.​So if right now you're making 100k a year and your existing TDSR is 50%, you can only take up another 10k/yr in loan repayment.​For a 2% mortgage interest on a 30 year loan tenure, you cannot borrow more than $225k. ​For a 6% interest on a 10 year loan tenure, you cannot borrow more than $75k. ​Thus if you cannot borrow the money for your purchase, you'll have to pay more using cash.0 comments0"
