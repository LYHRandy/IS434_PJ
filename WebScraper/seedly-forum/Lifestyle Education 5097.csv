1,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 30 May 2018This pay considered not bad already for dip grad. Even uni grads most will likely be this pay range. ‚ÄãDon't get fooled by the news articles saying uni grads mostly get 4-5k on graduation. Those are the exceptions. Maybe you are an exception too but here I assume average person.‚ÄãBefore you further studies, maybe you need to think, how does this degree help in your career path?Does being in the healthcare industry require a business management degree? Or did you choose this because you read articles or heard friends saying business degree has potential? ‚ÄãMaybe you can consider furthering your studies in healthcare related areas if you are really interested to go further into healthcare industry.0 comments1"

3,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018If you are passionate in what you are doing and you choose to study to upgrade in the same industry, then go for it. If you study to seek new opportunities in other industry, you may end up having a pay cut instead because you may not have the relevant experience. Think carefully. Just my humble opinion. 0 comments0"
4,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Your salary is considered very good given that you hold just a Diploma certificate as it's similar to a fresh graduate from University! With that said, I feel that getting a degree will potentially open more doors of opportunities for you and allow you to explore more areas especially if you decide to make a switch in the future. It also serves as a form of safety net. Ultimately down to you, as to whether you're satisfied with your job and salary. 0 comments0"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Sep 2018Honestly, 3.2k at your age with just a diploma qualification is quite a lot, and it's comparable to some entry level degree roles. That being said, do you still intend to stay in the same company after you get your degree? Maybe you can have a chat with your boss to see how it'll open up doors to you in the same firm once you graduate 0 comments0"

9,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Jun 2018To be honest I think this pay is quite decent for a dip. grad in healthcare industry. You'd need to decide for yourself if you are taking the course solely for the sake of increasing your income or because you have an interest as well. If for increase of income, usually people will take your work experiences into consideration once you've worked your first job and if you're thinking of using the degree to ask your current employer to increase your salary - it wouldn't have a big impact... so you'd need to look for a new employer (new set of considerations will then set in..!)‚ÄãKaplan is fine as the professors are still from the individual universities. Do some research to evaluate how's the review of these degrees are for robustness of course syllabus and quality of professors. I've attended SIM full-time course..International Business with Uni. of Birmingham and got so bittered and disappointed because the professors are mostly great with reciting what I have already read from the textbooks while my studies with Kaplan were much more rewarding (I worked for a while before signing up for a part-time degree) and really applicable to my work.‚ÄãAny investments should be considered in monetary and time wise of course but how you think/feel would affect how you perform in the course and whether you'd actually need it at all.‚ÄãHope that helps!0 comments0"
