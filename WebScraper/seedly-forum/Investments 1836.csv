1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hello! Gold mutual funds as an investment makes more sense. The benefit of investing in Gold mutual fund instead of physical gold is that the mutual fund is safer and more liquid. Physical fold has to be kept safe in a bank/locker whereas with gold mutual funds, investors do not have to worry about gold mutual funds getting stolen. In terms of liquidity, mutual funds can be redeemed electronically whereas for physical gold, you would have to take it to a jeweller to sell it.0 comments1"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Hello!I personally feel that investing in a gold mutual fund would be better than investing in the physical gold itself. This is because it is much more convenient as compared to investing in the physical gold. You do need to keep in mind that you do not own the gold. if you are someone who likes or wants to own the physical thing then maybe gold would be a better choice for you. The main reasons why i would prefer investing in a gold mutual fund would be because mutual funds are easy to trade, there is no need to store them and also there is no worry of theft.
Hope this helps!0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 29 Mar 2019Are you asking if you should buy physical gold or a Gold Fund?For precious metals, I suggest buying physical. No cost to hold other than security. I'm assuming you're buying mainly to hold and not to time the market.I'll only hold gold funds when I'm planning for a recession. And I'll exit when markets rebound. Gold usually inversely correlates to the US Dollar.0 comments0"
