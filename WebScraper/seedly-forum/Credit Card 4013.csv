1,"JasonLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 29 Aug 2019I got the Red Ruby card, the rebate is real (as far as Spotify is concerned), the rebate/cashback is in the form of MCO coin which I usually cash out immediately.Things about the card:1) To benefit from the rebates and cashback, you will need to have a ‘stake’ in MCO coin, you can see it as a deposit to use the benefits. For my card, the stake is 50 MCO, about 200 USD in total when I bought it. I treat the ‘stake’ like a refundable one-time credit card fee. Plus my savings from Spotify makes this ‘stake’ smaller as time goes by. Even though my MCO stake currently dropped by 10%, the accumulated savings I have earned from Spotify so far still gives me a net gain. The lock-in period for the stake is 6 months, you can cash out your stake when the lock-in period ends but lose the rebates/cashback features. I don’t see it happening to me anytime soon unless they stop their rebates or I change to something other than Spotify.2) Cashless payment has no limits, but not for ATM withdrawals. For my Ruby Red card, the monthly ATM withdrawal limit is $400. I tried withdrawing via DBS ATM, it works fine. Used it to purchase some groceries with no issues as well. The app has a cash wallet section, that is where the funds will be located, to transfer money into the cash wallet, you just need to sell the cryptocurrency and designate the funds to be deposited into the cash wallet, and you are good to go.3) Recently a new feature came out that allowed me to deposit the cryptocurrency I owned to obtain fixed returns. The rates are up to 8% p.a. with a duration of up to 3 months. I tested the 6% p.a. rate with a lock-in period of one month, and they have been giving me the yields every week. So far, I really like this feature as the returns are to my liking, allowing me to own cryptocurrency without the risk of being exposed to its volatility. The yields were given in the form of the cryptocurrency deposited. If it all works well, I might use this as another source of fixed D in the future.If you are interested in cryptocurrency AND have Spotify/Netflix, etc., this card will suit you and would provide a long term return of your subscription fees. You can treat the ‘stake’ as a refundable credit card fee when you do not need the card in the future.Please note that the above statements are just my personal opinion, I strongly suggest anyone interested to read up more about MCO before going in. Cryptocurrencies are very volatile, be cautious with your money if you intend to buy some. Respect how you spend your money, and your money will return you in kind.Cheers!If you don't mind, feel free to ask me for my referral code.1 comment1"

There is free tier as well but 1% Cashback only. 
There is no fees for the card for like monthly fee /  for maintaining the card like traditional cards."
