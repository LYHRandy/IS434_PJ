1,"Randy ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 10 Sep 2019Hi there,Unfortunately, you will not be able to convert Citi Miles to Citi ThankYou points. However, you are able to transfer ThankYou points to your frequent flyer program at no additional charge (1 Citi ThankYou Point = 1 KrisFlyer Mile).Citi Miles are earned through usage of your PremierMiles credit cards (either with Citi's PremierMiles Visa or American ExpressÂ® Card)** while Citi ThankYou Points are earned through usage of your Rewards credit cards** (either with Citi Rewards Card or with the Prestige Card).Source: Citibank's credit card pageIt's good to note that for every S$1 spent locally will earn you 3.35 ThankYou Points (which is equivelent to 1.3 Citi Miles).Which means that If you're on the Citi Prestige Card, 30, 000 ThankYou Points will cost you roughtly S$ 8955 while 30, 000 Miles will cost you roughly S$ 23, 076.Also, do note that CitiMiles earned through your Citi Cards are not considered as true air miles. They are like reward points which you can convert to KrisFlyers mile with a 1:1 conversation rate.If you're interested to learn more about this topic, do check out this article, ""How to redeem Citi ThankYou Points for KrisFlyer Miles"" written by Get.com here.Alternatively, you can read more Q&As on this topic within the community or simply by searching for these keywords, ""KrisFlyer Miles"" or ""PremierMiles"" on Seedly.Could you also share with me why you're looking to convert your Citi Miles to ThankYou Points?I hope this will help!2 comments4"
