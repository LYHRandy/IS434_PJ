1,"Jacqueline YanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 19 Sep 2019I think this highly depends on your current income and how much of it you're allocating to your savings. There's going to be quite a bit of planning to do. Are you paying for your school fees on your own? Do you need to save as you go? How much more can you allocate to savings for your future BTO?Assuming that you'll be paying for your wedding with your savings, that brings you down to 5k (probably a bit more since you still have a few more months to save)? Even if you successfully BTO next year, you'll still have to wait at least 3 years before you collect the keys and make any big payment. Don't forget renovation costs. Your HDB loan will only be lower if you're still studying full-time (likely working part-time?) at the point of assessment. That might just play well for you since you're likely to get more from the EHG with a lower household income. Your timeline actually ain't that bad, you just gotta prioritize and ask yourself if you'll benefit from getting a degree.I finally decided to get a degree after working for 5 years and unfortunately,  I have to save up for it as I go. It's also eating into the amount that I'm saving for my BTO, though I haven't had any luck with getting a ballot. Even though it limits what I can do right now, I know it's an investment that'll be worth it. Oh yea, it definitely also depends on which field you're interested in!3 comments1"

Working part-time while studying full-time might still cover your own expenses along with your allowance to your parents, but may not be able to sustain your investments with StashAway and DBS RSP. 

... (more)JWjiajing wang20 Sep 2019Yeah. It's the last one that I am having issue with. My SO just wants me to have a degree because she is taking masters. She just do not want our education level to be far. I do think that getting a degree Will value add to my job. But she doesn't invest and don't care about money so she has this mindset money can be saved again. Studies cannot wait"
