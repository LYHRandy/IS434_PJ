2,Tee-Ming Chew29 Aug 2018Upvoting Gabriel's answer. I feel that the focus should be on the loans first as your investment returns are not guaranteed
3,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Do both, but a bit more on clearing debts. This is because, interest payable on loan is guaranteed, but investment returns are not. Also, clearing the debts relieves you from the burden of worrying about it. ​Note: do not go into more debt for investments. It does not bode well, coming from someone who tried to leverage for stock investments. 2 comments1"
4,"Eric Chia29 Aug 2018Yes, and actually if your investment gives better returns than the loan interest rate, you can channel more money into the investment to pay off the loan faster.Rave Ong Ci De30 Aug 2018I agree. However OP is a fresh grad, and hence, may not be able to consistently generate higher returns than the loan interest rates. Even if OP did, would OP be comfortable doing it? Also, the intangible benefits of clearing off a loan may be better, ie clearer state of mind, lesser temptations to do “funny” stuff to money, etc. "

MasterAnswered on 29 Aug 2018Investments are non-guaranteed, but interest on your debt will continue to roll.​Ultimately, it depends on your cashflow and budgeting, and of course how long you intend to repay your loans. If you earn a relatively comfortable income and have low expenses, perhaps can apportion a part of your income for investments. If you are intending to clear your student loans fast, one way is to take advantage of balance transfer​At the same time, also do set aside a portion of your income for insurance coverage, and saving for upcoming big ticket items such as Proposal, wedding, house, renovation etc.0 comments0"
