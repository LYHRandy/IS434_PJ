1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2019IF you are age 68, you can only transfer OA monies to RA (to get 4% to 6% interest depending on how much you have inside it), up to the ERS (Enhanced Retirement Sum). However, I would suggest transferring to both spouses (if you have) up to BRS first, before moving on to FRS and ERS, since the first 60k CPF earns 5% to 6% interest.For related information...Your SA will be drawn out first in the event that you are withdrawing from your OA and SA. So doing Voluntary Contributions e.g of $1,000 it will be split as follows:OA: $80.00.00 SA: $80.00.00 MA: $840.00If your MA has reached BHS (basic healthcare sum), it will change to:
OA: $920.00 SA: $80.00This will give you a blended return of 2.3% + 0.32% = 2.62% interest.3 comments1"

You can top up and apply for CPF LIFE, up till 80 years old. But do talk to CPF directly for if you are buying CPF LIFE, because they know best. I am only able to advise based on what i know... Make a trip to CPF :)Ang Hongs23 Sep 2019This is so helpful  üëç"
