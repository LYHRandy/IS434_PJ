I usually head on to www.investing.com as it encompasses counters from every country and there's push notifications on market news (similar to Bloomberg and CNBC)Nonetheless, here are a couple of other sites you could look into for company information. www.sgx.com (quite comprehensive as they link you to financials of the company too)www.investingnote.comwww.jitta.comwww.stocks.cafehttps://sg.finance.yahoo.com/https://www.cnbc.com/markets/www.bloomberg.comHope it helps! :)1 comment4"

3,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi Zetong, usually what I do if I want to get a really detailed fundamental analysis on a company is to head over to their company website and download their past few year annual reports. Usually I take about 3-5 years, so I can get a good idea of how their 3 financial statements have been changing: 1)Cash flow statement (see their expenditure, how much have they been using to buy assets, how much is paid out to debtors eg.) 2)Balance Sheet (their Asset, Liabilities and Equity to give you overview of the holdings and capital structure of company)3) Income Statement (how much Net income, EBIT, taxes are they generating/paying, their costs eg.)These 3 are the backbone of any financial analysis. you can derive your relative valuation ratios (your P/E, PEG, EV/EBITDA or any other ratio you like) all from these 3 FSs. You can do your DCF modelling using these numbers, if you are really into doing your own evaluation of the intrinsic value of the stock!Usually apart from ther 3FS, I read up alot of their financial news and their going ons on their company website, and financial news platforms as well to get a general idea of how have they been performing.If you don't really have the time, you could head over to sginvestors.io to get professonal analyst reports on different stocks on the SG exchange, such as from OCBC investments, Phillip Capital etc. that do analyst reports for their clients and recommend buy/hold/sell. However, I take these with a pinch of salt - they are sell-side, meaning they benefit with more people buying into the stock, so they tend not to recommend sell unless the company is on the verge of collapse. Make sure to read through their assumptions, and formulate your own opinions! don't blindly follow their recommendations.I think thats the general gist of it, good luck, and I hope I've given you some tips to help you along your journey!1 comment4"
