question,"Investments Family DBS OCBC PhillipCapital (POEMS) Asked by Alicia LeongAsked 5d agoAre there any regular savings plans that allow a joint account with children and parent?I intend to open a joint child-adult RSP for my child until he is 18 or 21 years old. So far I only found 3 providers that provide such a service. Namely DBS, OCBC and POEMS. Any other banks? Is POEMS a better option than the other 2? Thanks!1 answerAnswerBump1"

1,"Alvin TeoLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 2d agoGreat that you plan on investing money instead of giving it to your kid, it’s a good way to do financial planning. Not only is the platform important but also how much you plan to invest on a regular basis. Transaction fees aren’t the only way as there is also wrap fees where you pay a % annually rather than based on how many transactions you make. Right now, are you on any RSP yourself? If yes, it may potentially cost lesser to do in your own account with you rather than separate it into two accounts. Usually this is option for people with more than one kid and would like to distinctly divide the holdings. There is little to no diff to hold a joint account when you can eventually just transfer it to your boy when he is of age. Do visit those providers or an independent financial adviser like myself to see what options are available to you. Remember, the Platform is just a means to get things done.0 comments0"
