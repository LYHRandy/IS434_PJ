GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My flat is funded fully from CPF, I have zero cash outlay for it.Recommended investment vehicles besides CPF:Risk averse investor:SSB, STI ETF, FDsModerate investor:Mid cap, small cap and blue chip stocksHigh risk investor:CFDs, Forex, Options tradingAsk yourself first, what is the time horizon you're looking at to set aside the money? What is the amount that you're trying to achieve through investments? Are you reliant on your investments to generate income for the long term? Do you have any emergency funds parked aside outside of your investments portfolio?That way, you can determine which investment vehicle is most suitable for you.3 comments1"

I am comfortable having the cash flow to generate greater returns by touching alternative instruments.

You are right, I am also incurring 2.6% interest on the loan that I have taken as well.

4,"Loo Cheng Chuan, Founder at 1M65 MovementLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018It all depends On my phase of life. The most important point is : Don’t Over Stretch Yourself in your home purchase.I have always stayed in a HDB flat. Started with a small one and gradually move to a bigger one. We are still staying in one after all these years. Clearly I don’t believe in properly investment (but that just me) . When i I was young and starting out, I use more CPF OA, soon, I discovered 1M65 so I moved to less CPF and More cash. It was easier then as I don’t have a big flat.  I believe that housing loan is quite a ”healthy loan”, i.e. I can put money into SA and get up to 5% and housing loan charges only 2.5%. 0 comments0"
