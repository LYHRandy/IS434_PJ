1,"Sarah Chan, Business Administration at NUSLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Hey there anon!! Here's what I think after analysing your scenario:1) Assuming the scholarship covers your school fees and gives you a small sum as allowance too, it definitely helps you in potential student debt. 2) Will the total sum of scholarship be as high as whatever you're earning from teaching? Maybe yes, maybe no - you decide on the answer as I don't know the exact value of your scholarship.If no, then continuing the lessons might seem more worth it, aye?Additionally, if yes, you get to value add to these students' lives too, right?Seems like everything is in favour of continuing the lessons and earning the 4-6k/month right? Yes (in my opinion), but short term wise. Here's why I think so:1) Long term wise, the investment in the degree would pay off - literally, it'll give you a better pay as a music educator for sure!2) Long term (or short term wise - up to you to decide) a recession is coming. Being educated while under a scholarship would be to your advantage than being employed and at multiple risks from the economy.3) While studying, i'm sure you can still teach part time during the weekends or on your free days! I've had 3-day work weeks in uni before. I'm sure your past clients would continue hiring you or recommend you to others too! Especially given your prior teaching experience.In short, I'm team uni based on what you've presented. Then again, I'm no expert in the music industry or 100% understand how the high qualification you currently possess stands in your industry compared to getting a degree. These are my two cents worth of opinion based on the facts you've presented. Maybe consult a senior in the music indsutry/school too!All the very best in whatever your choice is! :-)3 comments11"
2,"See all 3 comments Question Poster11 Jun 2019The issue tho is that the scholarship is for a field completely irrelevant to music (engineering) which I'm okay studying but thinking I'd continue teaching music after graduating with an eng degree..Sarah Chan11 Jun 2019Ahh, i see... If that's the case, I would encourage you to think more long term, like whether you would consider switching to the engineering industry in the future or not + are you alright with the current qualification you possess in music because I doubt you would have enough time to continue picking up an even higher qualification alongside your engineering curriculum when uni commences. I'm still pro uni because picking up an engineering degree is highly versatile! Engineers can venture into other industries too. If all else fails (*touch wood!*), i'm sure the 4-6k/m... (more)"

1. Follow your heart and trust that it knows where it's going.
2. The worst thing that could happen might turn out to be the best thing that could happen.
3.  If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right
4. Time in life is limited. Don't waste it living someone else's life
5. Stay hungry. Stay foolish (my interpretation.. hungry to improve yourselves and foolish to fall forward)0 comments4"
4,"Tan Wei MingLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 11 Jun 2019Prof Ben Leong on NUSWhispers answered a question whether one will be successful in life with a degree. Here is it: You probably need to define big. What does big mean to you? But in general, even without knowing what your big is, a degree is probably not enough, whatever that big is. Next you need to define what success means to you. If your definition of success is not to be homeless and to own a dog, you can probably get there without a degree in Singapore. If your definition of success is to become a billionaire, then it's a different league. To answer questions like this, one doesn't actually need a degree. The way we try to answer is to look around and to see how the world works.First, there are obviously some jobs that need the degree. If your definition of success is lawyer or doctor, confirm need a degree. If you want my job as prof, you actually need a couple and not just one. But I definitely wouldn't recommend prof as definition of success, because there is a risk that you will get these ""if you are so smart, why aren't we rich?"" questions from the wife from time to time. Then you look around some more, you will suddenly realize that actually most jobs do not actually need degrees. People have been complaining to me that we have a lot of graduates these days, but quality is often wanting. The biggest mystery is why do so many of these jobs advertise that they need a degree when if you look at what the job actually entails, obviously don't need. I tell you why. What employers want are minions--and they want good minions. Good is smart and hardworking. The degree is mostly used as a signal to shortlist the people who are potentially smarter and more hardworking. So actually what's happening is an arms race. It actually doesn't help anyone if more people get degrees -- simply because most jobs currently do not need degrees.  What matters more is actually the relative education more than the actual degrees. Even if everyone has a degree, degrees from the public universities will be perceived as better then the private schools, unless they do something clever like say SIT. SIT has this specialized degree that is a tie-up with Digi-pen that is recognized as the Harvard of Games Development. So that will work, but there's a price. The programme is v hard and it's probably hard to pass. Basically, the only way to get a degree of value is to get tortured. There is no easy path. Don't get me wrong, more school is generally not  a bad thing, except money doesn't grow on trees and there's significant opportunity cost. I am quite concerned at the proliferation of degrees because we have examples in Korea and Taiwan, where everyone has a degree, but a lot of people have no jobs. Why do we think we will be different and if more people have degrees, they will have higher paying jobs? But this current situation is what's called the Prisoner's Dilemma. We all know that a degree is in general not v useful, but if someone ""cheats"" and gets a degree, everyone is worse off, i.e. everyone spends more money and time but they are back to square one. The Government is trying to tell people not to pursue degrees to avoid this situation and going down the route of Korea/Taiwan, but I don't think it's succeeding v well --- but I don't think it's the Government's fault. It's just v v hard to overcome the propensity to ""cheat"" when in a Prisoner's Dilemma. Tuition in Singapore is fueled by the same sort of fears/mechanism. To summarize, whether a degree is needed or not is not the right question. The key to recognize how things work and to realize that there is a significantly risk that a degree will be quite worthless as we see a proliferation of degrees in the coming years. People just check out Korea and Taiwan to get a glimpse of a plausible hard landing that we are looking at. When the implosion happens like these countries, our people will then wake up to the idea that degrees were never really required to be with. But when that day comes, there will be a lot of waste and hardship. I really don't think I am in a position to tell people what to do to succeed in life. I can try a stab at potentially helping people and how life works to maybe improve their odds of being a bit happier:Develop self-awareness and understand what really matters to you. Just because your parents say you need a degree and your friends say you need to grow up to make a lot of money doesn't mean that you will necessarily be happy getting that degree and making lots of money. Keep in mind that there's no free lunch. Even if you do end up making a lot of money, there will be a cost to that -- and you better be sure that you are happy to give up what you need to give up to get there. Self-awareness also involves getting a handle on what you're good at. If you have been failing math in school, please don't try to do CS, which is applied math more or less. Don't do law just because your parents think lawyers make a lot of money.  Find something else that you're naturally good at and work at becoming world class at that. It could be making chicken rice. You make good chicken rice, I will come eat. Get the expectations sorted out and set right. A lot of unhappiness comes from unmet expectations and in many cases, if we look at it realistically, the expectations were set out to fail. Set stretch goals but make sure that they are realistic. Talk to people in the industry that you are interested in. Interestingly, I will be meeting this boy who is thinking of becoming a prof. He wants to find out from me what it's like and how to get there. And to conclude: I think the right question that people should ask is not so much ""how do I succeed?"", but ""what am I willing to pay?""  If you are willing to work 996 and do things that people are not willing to do for a sustained period of time, your probability of success in life will be higher. Big success typically comes only when you also have supporting attributes like high EQ and street smarts, not to mention a big dose of luck. All the best.0 comments3"
5,"Siow Nan, Electrical And Computer Engineering at NusLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Is your scholarship based on a music-centric degree course that can help advance your music career later on?
are you looking to pursue a music teaching career later on? Would 4-6k/month be sufficient for your future needs, and how do you see the number to increase as years go by? The fact that you have a scholarship placement in a University means that you have the potential to do so much more.  Why not give it a try first, maybe if you cannot cope with both university and music teaching, you can trim down the number of students to a more manageable level.  In the short term, you might be making less, but who knows what other opportunities you might be missing if you skip the university route. Also, should you give up the scholarship placement, will it be given to the next qualified candidate?  It would be a waste of a scholarship slot if you had applied for it but not to go for it, and in turn deprive another candidate of their chance for the scholarship.2 comments2"
6,"Question Poster11 Jun 2019The scholarship is for an engineering course so yep kinda lost as I'm okay studying engineering but I'm not sure if I'll truly enjoy doing what an engineer does in the workforce tho I know I'm cool doing music as a careerSiow Nan11 Jun 2019I graduated from engineering as well, but that does not mean we are restricted to a pure engineering career later on. Myself and many of my peers have ventured beyond engineering, and I would say engineers are a resilient bunch and can adapt to different work environments easily. There is even a field for music engineering that might interest you too."
7,"Heng Kai Le, Mondomover at School Of LifeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 11 Jun 2019As a teacher myself, i know how hard it is to ""give up"" on students, especially those with whom you have built rapport and strong connections. can i just say that children are often more resilient than what we give them credit for? i know of students who are coping admirably with fissures in their parents' relationship. they will survive without you, if you don't mind me putting it bluntlyjust because you're parting ways with them now doesn't mean that your paths won't cross in future. Singapore is so small, lol. i taught a student for a month when she was in Sec 2. after she graduated from sec sch, she went to the same poly i was lecturing at. although i didn't teach her personally, she came to me for help with her assignments, hahaha. this is gonna sound philosophical, but fate plays a part in determining the depth of our relationships with certain individualsalso, why not think of this scholarship as a chance to hone your skills so that you sharpen your saw and can impact your future students more effectively? think of all the competencies and enhanced knowledge you can leverage to excite and enthuse them!all the best!0 comments1"
