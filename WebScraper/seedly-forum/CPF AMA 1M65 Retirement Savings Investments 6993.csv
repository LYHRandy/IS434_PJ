RookieAnswered on 29 Nov 2018Our risk appetite will change according to our life stages, taking on too much risk when you need to feed your family could lead to a disaster whereas being too risk adverse could mean you lose out. I’m not one to speak as I don’t bring decades of experiences, however I know such FAs which will be more than willing to share with you FOC. :)0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Nov 2018You can find a fee based advisor like Wilfred Ling from Promiseland or Christopher Tan from Providend. Not exactly sure of their rates but, if you want qualification and experience, you can't go wrong with them.0 comments0"
