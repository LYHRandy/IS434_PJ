1,"Amos GohLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 13 Apr 2018I think it differs from person to person. Yes, different banks give consumers different interest rates but these often come with strings attached. These criteria / conditions sometimes erodes your capital and this might end up causing you not to save any money.For example, if you are a fresh graduate, you must have salary crediting and overcome several hurdles before you can hit the interest of around 2% for DBS Multiplier. In contrast, a SSB would be in the ballpark of a 10 year-guaranteed 2% rate for $500-100K.0 comments6"

3,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 03 May 2018There are many products to achieve similar returns.â€‹CPF can be considered a bond, super long term bond. Because you can only cash out at a certain age. But the interest is guaranteed and very high for a low to no risk product.â€‹Most banks impose terms and conditions for their high interest savings account, be it in spending requirement, minimum deposit requirement, lock in periods, etc. â€‹Bonds are simplier but also carry its own risk. Bonds may default, in which case you may lose your capital investment. But there are also safer bonds such as Singapore Savings Bonds backed by the government.â€‹SSB is a no frills product, with a $2 transaction fee and a 1 month delay in withdrawal. â€‹In summary, it depends on your expectations and risk profile. People who are able to meet banks conditions might choose high interest accounts. And low spendings or savers might prefer SSB. And for the risk takers, they might choose bonds from the market.0 comments1"

5,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Apr 2018Yeah I think this is a common thought process and good question when thinking about Bonds vs low-interest rate other products (eg Fixed deposits or Endowments or High savings rate account or even CPF SA.) I would say there are many similarities but when you are talking about liquidity, both the DBS Multiplier account (or even other high savings rate accounts) and SSB do best. :DBut take into consideration that I believe many people go for SSB if they do not qualify for the many terms and conditions (T&C) for the high-interest rate savings account. Normal savings account only get you between 0.05% to under 1% p.a. So if you have no other options, SSB can work well for you!0 comments1"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Banks may change the terms and interest amount any time they want, usually with some notice period. Whereas bonds will pay the coupon rate for the stated period. Bonds may default though, so need to choose the bond carefully. Best if you can get some that are issued by our government if you are looking to buy some. Hope this helps 0 comments0"
8,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018don't think any savings account in singapore gives high interest than bonds haha. also, savings accounts usually have a limit whereby they do not give the higher interest after the cap0 comments0"
9,"Jay Liu, Sleepyhead at Land of Dreams Level 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018To hit those 3.x% high yield interest savings account, you have to fulfil the conditions to achieve that interest rate. So others who do not want to spend just to hit that interest rate, they'll go for alternative products. 0 comments0"
10,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Sep 2018Both works, in the long run, SSB might offer better returns than the savings account. Moreover, the higher interest savings accounts usually requires you to hit certain criterias such as salary credit and minimum spending on a few categories0 comments0"

12,"Yeap Ming FengLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 17 Apr 2018Few things, there is usually a cap for bank accounts to enjoy the maximum interest rates, plus to hit their highest interest rates tier, there's some criteria and at times it involves spending too.
While it doesn't make sense to say open two bank accounts and try to maximise the interest for both, investing allows one too. Next, bank accounts interest rate is at the mercy of the bank. Remember the case with OCBC 360 and all where they change their criteria overnight. That is the risks involved too. 0 comments0"
