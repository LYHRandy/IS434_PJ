1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Jan 2019Its a form of guarantee (based on the gauranteed amount), that a certain amount of money will be given to you once it matures.There is a component which is tagged into the endowment.1) A non-guarateed component which is put into bonds and equities to beat whatever bank rates (fixed deposit) has offered to the mass market.2) A insurance portion whereby 105% of premiums paid or 101% of total surrender value (whichever higher) will be given to the beneficiary in the event death has occurred.3) Hence to many people, it is an effectively a savings plan for people, or a potential better than fixed deposit savings account.To choose 1, it is best to get the highest Internal rate of return (IRR) based on the plan.Also, do take note that the IRR consist of guaranteed and non-guaranteed (so choose the plan that has a higher guaranteed and total IRR is the same) for your endowment.0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Jan 2019Form of 'forced savings' product from insurers that has a mix of life protection and 'investment'. Premiums you pay go in part to a fund comprising mostly of bonds and some equities. May be suitable for those who are not savvy about investing their own funds and do not wish to pick up any knowledge. Not good due to the very low yield. I'd suggest learning how to invest on your own which can give better returns on the same amount of money. Or if you have a low risk appetite, consider parking in fixed deposits or Singapore savings bonds instead. Hope this helps 0 comments0"

4,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Jan 2019It is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term or on death. Often advertised as a forced savings plan. Make sure you know the guaranteed returns. Look at other alternatives as well such as Singapore Savings Bonds or high interest savings account. Put your money into something that suits you because everyone is different.0 comments0"

What you do need to know is that it's an asset, and buying one is an investment.It's usually an illiquid asset that provides guaranteed and non-guaranteed return subjected to the bonuses paid out by an insurer in relation to how well the participating fund (only for participaying plans) that your money is invested in, performs. I would recommend endowment plans to people who die die needs the money invested to be there upon certain life events, like paying for a child's education or for retirement nest egg/income.The yield for participating endowment policies can yield anywhere between 2-4.5%. And every endowment plan can be different in their own way.To choose one, look out for (some of them are very complex and you may not know how to properly judge if you're not an FA):follows a timeline you wanthas a high yield upon maturity or at a certain age as written in the benefit illustrationthe % of the total bonuses paid out upon maturity shouldn't be too high compared to bonuses paid out each yearUsually shorter premium terms but with a longer policy terms work better.The expense ratio of the company's par fundThe bonus pay out table in relation to $ for every $1000 sum assured as stated in the product summaryThe reputation of the company for honouring bonuses promised.Flexibility of the plan and added benefits (cash in early, policy loan, assignment option, life replacement options, etc)Could be more but I think I named quite a lot already.My advice is to speak to an IFA, at least you have a comparison available for almost all the products available in Singapore.0 comments0"
