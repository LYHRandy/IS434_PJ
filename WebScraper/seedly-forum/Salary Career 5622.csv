God of WisdomAnswered 3w agoThe rule of thumb I use when friends ask me would be 3-5% per year for the total amount of years you were at your current job.So if you've worked for 3 years, you can negotiate a 9-15% raise. If 5 years, a 15-25% raise.This rule is pretty applicable until you are close to your 50s.0 comments4"

Not including bonuses.Always remember to negotiate on a basic annual salary. Ask for the higher range then negotiate down. Show them you are willing to negotiate.0 comments0"

4,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered 3w agoWhen I interview people, I notice people who are skilled and is shifting to look for a better salary, tend to have an asking salary of roughly 10% more than their last pay. Some even ask for 20% if they know that they are in demand.For people who just hate/dislike their previous/current jobs, they tend to have a round figure increment such as $100 over their last pay. And when I negotiate, they are actually okay with the same figure or even a pay cut, because they dislike their current job so much.So these are the current competitors- go ahead and ask for 10% and even more if you know your skillsets are quite in demand.0 comments0"
5,"Adrian Goh Jun Wei, Product at NodeflairLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated 3w agoI cannot help with the question on how much the increment should be, but at NodeFlair where we connect many software engineers with companies, it's rather interesting to see the different reasons people explore job opportunities. Some of the main reasons are:Looking for growth opportunitiesPoor work culture (Backstabbing)Poor management (Lack of direction, voices not heard)Inflexibility (e.g. overly strict working hours)Seeking for higher salary/incentives (e.g. starting a family)As much as this might sound surprising, most youths (people under the age of 35) don't explore other job opportunities because of salary-related reasons but because of growth opportunities. Being able to learn new skills and do interesting projects that can help them learn is more important than the increment in salary, as these skills might potentially lead to better career growth (and eventually higher salary in the future)0 comments0"
6,"Leong Wen Fong, Growth Manager at Trive Venture CapitalLevel 6. MasterAnswered 4w agoHonestly, there's far too little information to go along here - you might as well ask ""Am I on track to be a millionaire?""Opportunities and growth are different for different industries and job roles. As with your current title and experience. Roles ranging from marketing, design, analytics, engineers - all have different growth paths and different starting salaries. Industries from finance, logistics, retail - all offer different types of remuneration and again- future opportunities.Also, no one can tell whether you are on track to earning 4k or not if you don't let us know what your current salary and experience.One general tip I can tell you is that you are not obliged to disclose your past salary to your prospect employer - so use that to your advantage. So how much increment is really up to you, and how capable you can appear to your possible future employer0 comments0"
