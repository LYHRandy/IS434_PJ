1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Hi,The pro is that you can get a feel on the valuation investors are expecting on similar type of company. The con is that if the market is overvalued and the comparable companies are all priced at overvalue valuation then you may be paying a high price for the company using relative method.0 comments1"
2,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Apr 2019Another thing is that RVs don't use your prediction of future cash flows, they use current EBITDA/EV/PE values to evaluate whether your firm is overvalued or undervalued - so you wont be doing any prediction of future earnings there. Though it is the strength of RVs to be able to reflect the current conditions of the market, it is also its weakness when it comes to talking about whether the market in itsself is overvalued, and does not take into account future events that may grossly impact the earnings capablility of a firm today.0 comments0"
3,Isaac ChanLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Here are some cons that you should look out for. Some companies are not good comparables with each other. Volatile changes in the stock market can affect the value you have determined. Valuation derived from RV may produce something very different from intrinsic valuation methods such as the Discounted Cashflow Approach0 comments0
