2,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Feb 2019REITs ETF is extremely attractive to passive investors and beginners as it provides the opportunity to better diversify investments sectorally and geographically and allows minimal monitoring of the performance of REITs. But as Nicholes mentioned, for those investors who prefer to have more control, it would be more worthwhile to do their research and select a few REIT. One point to note is that although REITs ETF allow minimal monitoring, investing in REIT ETF without first understanding the index that the REIT ETF tracks, undermines the benefits of minimal monitoring. Specific to Singapore market, the REIT ETF market is relatively new and thus the performances of the REIT ETFs have short historical performance data. More data is required to provide insights on long-term performances of REIT ETFs. 0 comments1"
