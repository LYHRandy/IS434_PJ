2,"Nguyen Thu HaLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 29 May 2019Hello! While rental yield shows you the flow of income over time, capital yield shows the growth of the property value. You should definitely look at both! Depending on what type of investment it is and your investment goal, rental yield and capital gain can be of equal importance. For short term investment, capital gain is what will set you apart as an investor. One way to look at it is that rental yield is the money that will look after your portfolio, but capital gain is the money that help you purchase the next investment grow your portfolio. To have a better understanding on how to increase rental yield, find out more at: https://www.99.co/blog/singapore/property-jargon-of-the-day-rental-yield/ Rental yield can be calculated based on previous transactions information. However, if you want to explore a more sophisticated calculation, a property agent can help.
