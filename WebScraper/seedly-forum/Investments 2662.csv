1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Feb 2019I think its important to differentiate between noise and relevant company news at changes fundamentals of TSLA given its long run of volatility especially since Elon's tweet of securing funding to taking TSLA private at $420. Since then, TSLA has gone through complications with SEC, multiple changes in board CFOs , Model 3 production issues and the surprise earning of Q3.To long term investors, TSLA's move into China comes as no surprise given China is TSLA's biggest overseas market. Manufacturing cars in China was the goal for ages as it allows TSLA to scale up production and saves TSLA hefty amounts in export taxes and shipping.In fact the growing demand of electric cars in China's domestic market has not just attracted TSLA but local new electric car makes such as recently IPOed $NIO in Nasdaq. Investors of TSLA should look beyond the short term implications of the Trade War but more on long term fundamentals, ultimately because TSLA is a growth stock. Ultimately, buying a Tesla or the stock is more than just buying into the growth of the electric car market or the prestige of TSLA. You're also buying into the vision Elon has of revolutionalizing the world with TSLA's technology.0 comments0"
