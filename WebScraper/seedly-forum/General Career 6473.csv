2,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Dec 2018It depends on what kind of work related materials you mean. Sometimes we do it because it helps our job a lot more (some companies just do not provide), and things might be urgent. (buying a test pen or putty and back claim later. If not approved also doesn't matter to me).But for big items, please do not do it at all because it will create a lot of issue. 0 comments1"
3,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 Dec 2018I think it depends on the type of work and your dedication (albeit sometimes not by choice). It is a commonplace for educators to splurge on stationaries, children's day/youth's day gifts, small tokens as rewards or for student's birthday -- all of which not claimable. If work related materials refers to computer/chair/table then that's quite unreasonable. You should exercise personal discretion when buying for yourself or for your colleagues.0 comments0"
