1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 12 Mar 2019I think that starbucks is quite an interesting example, being a trail blazer by setting the coffee culture and developing this culture around itself. I feel that what's fascinating about starbucks is that they focus so much on the overall experience of the customer in the store.To them, it's not just about the coffee but about the entire experience of being in the store. This in-house store experience helps it to differentiate itself from other players in the coffee industry.Like McDonald's, I believe Starbucks has also got it right in terms of choosing the best spots for where the store is held, even if rental costs there are exorbitent. That kind of frontage and accessibility seems to be one of the key drivers of growth for both these companies.Not really well-versed in marketing here, but starbucks seems to also be a success story (along with Apple and Google), about brand equity and the need to nurture and develop brand awareness within the consciousness of the public.Paying 7 to 8 SGD for a drink is actually expensive if you think about other comparable F&B items you can buy with that same amount, but somehow Starbucks has done it.Something else I believe it has done right is in specialising and promoting its core items, coffee, and not veering too much off course with other food items like it had done before0 comments1"
