1,"Elijah Lee, Independent Financial Advisor at Phillip Securities (Jurong East Lite)Top Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 4w agoHistorically, the traditional asset classes were equity, fixed income and money (money market/fixed deposits). In recent years, property, commodities, and even things like cryptocurrency have been added to the mix.Now, there's no right or wrong answer to how to structure your investment portfolio, a person adverse to risk might want to reduce or eliminate stocks completely, a person willing and able to take risk may skew the portfolio heavily in favour of stocks.What is important is to build a multi-asset portfolio with the flexibility to shift your allocation across the various asset classes in tandem with your evolving finances, age profile, risk appetites and lifestyle. Most young people often say that with time on their side, they start out with a portfolio that is high risk: I suggest an alternative viewpoint as such:Imagine that you have saved your first $50K after some time and you decided to purchase some shares. Now, due to lack of experience and knowledge, you end up buying something that doesn't really appreciate, or even worst, tanks 50%? How long do you need to save up another 25K to compensate for what you have lost?Hence I feel that there is a need to start cautiously when you begin your investment journey. If anything, the number one rule of investment is not to lose money, but by and large, most people suffer losses. I do advise my clients to ensure that there is sufficient diversification in their portfolio that if a bad investment decision was made, their portfolio should recover within a short amount of time. Once some experience is gained after your start, you'll be able to confidently take on more risk while minimizing your downside due to your newfound knowledge and experiences.On a personal note, I'm 40-50% in cash and 50%-60% into a diversified portfolio of UTs (regional equities, global bonds), shares, REITs and some SSB. The division between my UT, stock portfolio and SSBs is approximately 45/45/10. Adding on monthly to my UTs, I do DCA to ensure that I remain committed to growing my UT portfolio, for stocks, it is a matter of identifying opportunities when a good company becomes undervalued, which requires a lot of patience, I have a position in a local bank which I waited for more than a year to enter at a price I found acceptable.I don't intend to maintain a 1:1 ratio on UT/stocks forever, and I do see that a gradual shift to a 2:1 ratio as I age will most likely be the scenario. As we age, we will want to step down our risk, remembering that longevity is the multiplier of all risks when you are 70, you won't be able to handle your investments the way you did when you were 50. Topping that off, I have an annuity to complement CPF life when I retire, which I have not included in the figures.Hopefully, you will have gained some insight into my thought process, methods and philosophy, and incorporated the parts you found relevant into your own plans. Good luck!0 comments6"
2,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomAnswered 4w agoThere are 6 Asset Classes you can invest in.1) Equity2) Bonds/Fixed Income3) Property4) Commodities5) Cash6) Speculative Instruments (less of an asset class but more of a category)During your entire investment journey, you will look to invest into all of these asset classes with more emphasis on riskier instruments when you're young and can take risk and your investment portfolio isn't that big, and later in life into less risky assets to conserve and protect your capital, where volatility can literally give you a heart attack.During this journey, you also should consider when to accumulate dividends and when to start withdrawing dividends. Withdraw them too early and you won't be reaping the rewards of compounded growth.I have an ABCD framework that shows me when and how much to invest in these asset classes as we age and how our investment portfolio shifts from stage to stage. If you'd like to find out more about this, drop me a message because I would be unable to give exact financial and investment advice without doing a proper needs analysis. :)2 comments2"

4,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoI know many professional financial stuff will disagree with me...
I am 100% stocks. 100.I don't think Mark Zuckerberg made his fortune by some bonds or some gold. Neither did Warren Buffett... etc.And to be honest, 100% of what I intend for my portfolio is in stocks, but I am forced to hold bonds too. I hold some bonds giving 4%, 2.5% and 3.5%. They call it CPF. if I could, I would rather have stocks, but since its compulsory, it does give my portfolio a bit of balance too.The reason why I am 100%? It's because I still have more than 2 decades to 60 yo. I am fine with short term downs and ups of the stock markets.6 comments2"

6,"Vincent Tan Wen Bin, Assistant Vice President at Thinkers AllianceLevel 5. GeniusAnswered 2w agoI keep my portfolio in this formatStocks/REITsUT (Equities and Bond)RoboI don't do any SSB or fixed deposits as I find that the return they are giving is too low for current interest rate condition.
I buy stocks on ad hoc basis and will look for good buys that I can buy into as lump sum.For my UT and ROBO, I do it on a dollar cost averaging method. Buy investing into it every month so that the investment portfolio will grow.
If you are new and do not know where to start, I would recommend you to start using either robo or UT to kick start your investment journey.0 comments0"
7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered 2w agoI share Cedric's viewpoint on CPF being the 'bond' component of my overall portfolio. I run 2 different portfolios using REITs and business trusts with some margin together with a pure options portfolio. Don't see the need for multi-asset allocation as I'm focused on building the account size to give me the freedom of choice/retirement in the next handful of years0 comments0"
