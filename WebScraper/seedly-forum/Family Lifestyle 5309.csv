question,"Family Lifestyle Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Jan 2019How would you handle it if your son dropped his brand new Iphone (that you bought for him) and the screen cracked? Even if it was a genuine accident?My friend's son did it accidentally, and my friend got completely mad about it. I thought it was a little unfair because her son is usually very careful, and he worked really hard to get good enough grades to get this reward. (The son is in secondary school)8 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I think this is a chance to show him the difference between things that he earned and things that you are willing to give.Since he had to achieve good grades in order to get this reward, I would classify this under something that he ""earned"". From the sound of it, he worked hard to get it, so this is his reward. If we follow your description about him usually being careful about his things, then I do think that this is one of the chance to show him kindness.The problem with Singaporeans is that they rather ""teach a lesson"" about it and say that everyone has to earn everything. I attribute it to the meritocral government we grow up in. People become cynical, and only equate effort to whether someone deserves something.My take is that since he has already earned it, and felt the pain of the loss, why not take this chance to shwo him kindness instead? Instead of showing him that he has to earn everything, why not show him that mistakes are a part of life, but it doesn't mean that there can't also be love?I know taht this is a highly debatable response, but from the minimal description that you posted, he seems like a good kid, and probably feels bad enough taht he broke the new gift. More than showing him that everything must be earned (which he did for the iphone) why not teach him about being compassionate? I'm pretty sure that he will be grateful enough to take extra care about it.For those who say that ""he deserved it"" or ""it's your fault for giving him an iphone"". I think it's a very insensible thing to say. Have you not made a mistake at work before? Does it mean you should not be hired? If you made a friend angry, does it mean that you should not have friends?There's a time to teach about responsibility, there's a time to teach about character.Here's just my 2 cents about it1 comment6"
2,HC Tang04 Jan 2019Love it bro. Teach gratefulness and mercy from young! üòÄüëçüëçüëç We all need to learn be a little bit more graceful in our society. üëèüòÉüëç
3,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Can go check with Apple since it's new and they might honour the 1 year warranty (thought it doesn't cover the glass). If they don't provide free repair, then you can try to find reputable repair shops to repair. After this, get warranty from insurers as Telco these days does that (they partner with 3rd party) or find few external insurers do have such packages.In general , do put on a good case and tempered glass, even if drop only need to replace tempered glass at $10 to $15 as a good case and good tempered glass would protect it well.Like Wen Fong shared, maybe can use this chance to teach mercy and gracefullness as we all need a little more grace. üòÑ2 comments2"
4,"Question Poster04 Jan 2019Haha, it was just fresh out of the box. Very unfortunateHC Tang04 Jan 2019very sorry to hear about it .. but no choice.. u can go ask Apple and see if they are willing to fix for free out of good will but chances not high. Most importantly now is to get a case and tempered glass to fix on it the same hour when repair is done. "
5,"Jeff Yeo,   amateur Social contributor  at School of social sharingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Being angry about it is human nature, but that is a useless moment that would just make the kid feel worst.instead view this as a chance to teach the kid about cost and effect.Make him learn about responsibility aka making him pay for the repairs Since it‚Äôs a mistake he made.This will be carried on to his life in later stages.1 comment1"
6,"Leong Wen Fong04 Jan 2019Agree totally. A difference between a moment of anger, and a lesson about mistakes in life"
7,"Debbie TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 04 Jan 2019Too bad so sad. The child is already in secondary school, should be responsible for his belongings. Your friend can get her son to take charge in getting the cracked screen repaired by checking how much it costs to repair it, where to repair it, how long to save up for the repair, and what steps to take to prevent another incident like this. Hopefully he learns to be more responsible and the value of his own time and his pocket money. Meanwhile, he should continue using the phone. 0 comments1"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Since it doesnt happen often, get it fix for him for the first time but let him know he will have to deal with cracked screen or fix himself by working part time or go get a tempered glass and a case that protect the phone. I dropped alot so i have tempered glass and case all the time for my phone not iphone though.1 comment1"
9,"Leong Wen Fong04 Jan 2019i think this is a fair thing to do tbh. I feel some responses are too cynical, since OP said the boy worked hard for it and also is usually very careful"
