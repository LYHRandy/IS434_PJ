Asset and liability are not fixed and can change its status.So now insurance will be a liability to u. But when a successful payout happens, it becomes an asset. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 30 Nov 2018Insurance is an expense, until something happens to you, which will become an asset.Strictly speaking, Whole Life, Endowments and anything with cash value is considered an asset (since there is a value). But early in the years, it is a asset that did not grow with inflation. Only when its near maturity, then its capital gains are fully realised.Whether it is an income generating asset, or a depreciating asset, is also determined if you can withdraw the money out from it (and whether there is any capital loss etc).0 comments0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 28 Nov 2018A Whole of Life policy is an asset because you will die and you can surrender your policy for its cash value.A term life/ CI / H&S policy is an expense because there is no guarantee of payout.An endowment or other wealth products are also assets and would work similarly to bonds and other fixed income instruments. 0 comments0"
