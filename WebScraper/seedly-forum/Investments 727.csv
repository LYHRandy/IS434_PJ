ProdigyAnswered on 03 Aug 2019Hi,You could try Saxo Investor, they have USD account, their fees for U.S stocks and ETFs are probably the cheapest I have seen so far about 4+ USD. They do have 0.12% annual custody fee, but there is no minimum. Their customer service is also quite decent and their app and website are easy to use with simple UI.0 comments0"
