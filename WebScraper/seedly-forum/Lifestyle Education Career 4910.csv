1,"CGCharmaine GohLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 26 Mar 2019Just curious, which year are you in actually? I think as a freshman internships may not offer as much because of the limited knowledge you have in accounting, assuming you are looking at internships in an accounting firm. Hence it might be more beneficial to acquire new skills that can go a long way in helping you in both your university courses and future internships. As a senior, having an internship to put what you've learnt to practice in a practical environment would definitely be helpful and also help you remain competitive amongst your peers in my opinion. Or of course as other commenters have mentioned, why not do both! the internship experience is definitely valuable since work and school have undoubtedly different environments and 3 months is a fairly long period of time that can surely be dedicated to more than 1 thing:)0 comments1"

WizardUpdated on 20 Mar 2019I definitely would go for the internship, because:It adds to your real work experienceOne has to learn on the job for the internship in any case!Apart from knowledge, you also get to meet people in the industry you are interested in.No harm earning money on the side.Besides, you can use your free time to study, especially for subject matters like investment or coding!0 comments1"
3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 23 Mar 2019Why not do both? Investment courses usually take place over the weekend for one weekend only, with follow ups taking place via fb/telegram or webinars / physical meet up sessions. At least for the one I go for. So it's very possible to have both in your schedule during your 3 month period0 comments0"

MasterUpdated on 28 Dec 2018Go for a short internship stint as the experience will give you a competitive edge and add more value to your portfolio which should come in handy when you're job hunting after you graduate as compared to your peers who might have no experience0 comments0

7,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 27 Dec 2018Internship will be worth much more. It will help u greatly after u graduate. Try to get into a big name firm. The mere name of the firm on your resume will give u an edge over your peers. Another important thing is the contacts u will be getting, build a good relationship with all your superiors during your intern. They can be powerful referrals.0 comments0"
