2,"David Maximilian Tey30 Aug 2019I agree with Lok Yang Teng's point. However just to add on, if you really want to narrow in and search for quality stocks, my suggestion would be to consider looking at value stocks with highly defensive qualities to it. For example, you could consider looking at the healthcare market (Eg.Raffles Medical) or even telecommunication's market (Eg.Netlink), where these defensive stocks may even thrive in a recessionary, cyclical environment."
