WizardAnswered on 03 Jun 2019It is hard to tell when is the best time to buy.If after you buy the stock price increase, you will be happy.If it drops after you buy, you will be sad.If you never buy and it goes up, you will regret.If you never buy and it drops, you say heng ah.This is the different emotional aspect of investing. You just need to commit and be confident with your choice. Re-evaluate the choice every one a while to ensure the company is doing good.0 comments0"
