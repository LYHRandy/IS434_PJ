Just write like you are talking to a good friend, minus the technical stuff, talk plainly and sincerely.I find most direct answers will get thumbs up from appreciative readers.Sincerity is the greatest receiver of likes. (or go like carousell likes-for-likes... HAHAHAHAHA!)0 comments1"

9,"Alan KorLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 01 Sep 2019Could range from various topics like savings account, savings journey, loans, debt clearance, investment strategies, beginner investment knowledge etcThere are many personal finance topics out thereInformative answers which are given sincerely and without any advertisement for services are generally most likedBut there are a lot of insurance agents promoting their services here, trying to tap on the 16,000+ leads in Seedly, which is really a sad case for a good platform0 comments0"
