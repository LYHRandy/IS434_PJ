question,"Investments Savings Retirement Stocks Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Jun 2019Hey there Seedly community, I'm a 26 YO fresh graduate seeking investment advice. With current and recurring savings, what's the ideal investment portfolio allocation % you'll recommend?A 26 year old fresh ðŸŽ“ who started working less than a year ago, and currently single. Probably living the S'porean dream - find a partner, marry, buy house, have kids, feed your family, retire. Minus influencer.Current no debts (hooray!) and 10k in bonds. Another 70k in bank now with 1k monthly savings. I think high risk profile with time on my side and no huge expenses yet.Hence what's the best portfolio allocation %? In terms of specific bonds, ETFs, REITS, growth stocks, blue chips, etc.2 answersAnswerBump3"

1,"Hariz Arthur Maloy, Independent Financial Advisor at Promiseland IndependentTop Contributor (Sep)Level 9. God of WisdomUpdated on 10 Jun 2019Hold 6 months of your income as an emergency expense. For long term portfolios, have your age be the % of your portfolio allocated in bonds. Invest the rest in equities. Diversify across different geographies and sectors. Rebalance quarterly and adjust your portfolio allocation every 5 years.Next, choose if you want to take an active or passive approach, or a blend of both, and pay reasonable fees for such management.For shorter term portfolios, don't invest in equities for any monies you need within 3 years, and take a more conservative approach (30% Equity, 70% Bond) for goals within 4-7 years and balanced (50% Equity, 50% Bond) for 7-10 year goals.3 comments3"
2,"See all 3 comments Hariz Arthur Maloy10 Jun 2019It really is up to you. Some invest purely only growth, some tilt a lot towards value. I say as long as your overall equity portfolio is tilted slightly towards more small cap and value, the better. They have outperformed large cap and growth stocks since the great depression. I do have a small cap value tilt portfolio that I promote for aggressive portfolios. But I'll have to do a formal meeting with you to see if it suits your profile.Hariz Arthur Maloy10 Jun 2019I wanted to post a few screenshots, but I can't do it here."
3,"Ericsson TingLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Tip 1: Long-Only Investing for Retail InvestorsInvest in Stock & Bond ETFs.For Singapore Stock & Bond ETFs, that's ES3 & A35.Â Use  110 - your age  for the Stocks: Bond ETF ratio.Remember toÂ rebalance once every year. (i seldom rebalance though)Buy & Sell to bring your stocks & bonds to that  110 - your age  ratio.Consider exposure in other markets, e.g.. S&P500, China Large-Cap ETFs, etc., for diversification & growthÂ If an ETF shuts down, its assets get handed back to the shareholders.Â A 100%-equities portfolio is also a bad idea.Â STI's more tightly linked with economies like China and Malaysia and Indonesia than it is with the US and EU.In the long run, an investor's return is measured as earnings per share growth + dividends + changes in valuation(PE ratio).Â Tip 2. Lump-Sum Investing / Dollar-Cost-Average?Â Consider dumping it all at once / in 3 portions.Â To minimize buying high, split into 03 parts.Invest 1 part each month, until you are fully invested.That way, if the stock goes up, at least, you bought some.If the stock goes down, you have the cash to buy more at discounted prices.Avoid making many trading transactions per month, as that amounts to a high trading fee.In my case, I use posb invest saver for the dollar cost average, while when I am trading I am will use the lump sum methodâ€‹this are just some tips from shiny thing from hardwarezone,i have summarize the various point on my blog: https://sonicericsg.blogspot.com/2018/12/post-68week-49learning-investingtrading.html2 comments1"
4,"Question Poster11 Jun 2019Thanks for the tips Ericsson! Tip 2 resonates with me as I'm unsure how I should time my entry into the market. Either via all at once buying into different stocks or spacing it out to a few periods for different or a smaller pool of stocks. But it's better to start now than never. I'm looking at both ETFs and stocks as a form of diversification, would you have any suggestion on how my portfolio should look?Ericsson Ting11 Jun 2019As mention above. Use 110 - your age for the Stocks: Bond ETF ratio.
Remember to rebalance once every year. (i seldom rebalance though)
Buy & Sell to bring your stocks & bonds to that 110 - your age in your case, it is 110-26=74% ,so 74% in stock and 26% in bond etf. For stock you can consider those in STI ETF ,such as DBS,Ocbc,uob etc"
