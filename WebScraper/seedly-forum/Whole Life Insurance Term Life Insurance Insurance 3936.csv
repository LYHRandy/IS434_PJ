question,"Whole Life Insurance Term Life Insurance Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Feb 2019Am I paying too much insurance premiums?I am reviewing my insurance plans and realised I'm paying quite a high amount of premiums (range of $3k annual) for Life insurance (with CI) and term life insurance with $1mio coverage. Other than these two plans, I am also paying for Premier on top of the usual MediShield option. I know it can be subjective here, but am I paying too much? I bought them when I was 27, pretty late. It's only been 1 year in.3 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Feb 2019Instead of looking at premiums, look at coverage.You should have 10-15X your annual income as Life Cover, 3-5X your annual income as income protection (CI).If you're making 50k a year, that's 500-750K in Life Cover and 150-250K in CI coverage. If you're covered for more, you may want to decrease your cover. Typically, if you're covered for the above amounts, you should be paying 8-12% of your monthly income in life insurance.0 comments1"
2,"Lim Wei Siang, Financial Consultant at Advisors Alliance Group - Aia FaLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 08 Mar 2019I believed you had your answers but I would like to offer a different opinion.This is what I believe:Coverage - how much do you think you want from the insurer? And how Long should they be able to last you or your family in the event of misfortune?Premium affordability - are you comfortable in the amount because it is important that premiums are within comfortable budget to ensure that your policy stays in force.Life with CI - frankly, any policy with CI coverage will cost more but I believe it is an important coverage thus leading toPriorities and importance/concerns - budget allocation I have to agree with Mr Chang...there are many different factors affecting a decision on suitability and different products that can be mixed and matched to try achieve what you require, within your comfortable budget. Think of it like a Set Meal vs Ala-carte.It will be best to talk to your Financial Consultant or have another to review and have the discussion together. Actions brings about Reactions/Consequences.Knowledge increases your choices and thus deciding on an action with a reaction you are comfortable to bear.0 comments0"
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 06 Feb 2019As Hariz mentioned, u should look at coverage instead. But since it's only been 1 year since u have purchased, it is not too late to review. You can reconsider if u really need a whole life(i assume is) insurance  (u also didnt mention the coverage). You could have gotten a term life with CI instead. The rest of the money u can invest through any instruments. The $1mio term life: You could add ci coverage to this so that u could do without your other whole life. Or if u want additional $1mil coverage, maybe look for cheaper plans in the market. $1mil coverage can be gotten for just $492/yr (assuming u are a male).There will be more details we need to look at. Only when u can see alternatives, then u can compare and decise whether u are paying more than u should be getting instead. Do add me or any other experts here on facebook to discuss in detail. 0 comments0"
