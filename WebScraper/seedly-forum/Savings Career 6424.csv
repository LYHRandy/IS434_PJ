Grand MasterAnswered on 15 May 2019Depending on his fixed expenses his savings will varies. A good amount of savings will be 20% of whatever income earned. Its hard to say if he should find another job. Where does he wants to be at say 5 years down the road? Works towards that and invest in himself to get the necessary skills. In between the 5 years, sure he can switch job for a higher paying one or ask for a raise with the existing company, but the ultimately he should be working towards his Goals.0 comments2"
2,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 May 2019Everyone has different starting point so there isnt a guage as how much we 'should' have at x age. It's not the amount currently that matters, it's about the steps you take to ensure it keeps increasing. A rough estimate would be at least 6 months' worth of monthly salary.Where does you passion lie? Is it in the F&B sector? If it isnt, then maybe you should rethink and consider doing something you like. This way, you will have motivation to do your best. If this is your passion, maybe you can consider going for workshops or courses to upgrade your skills so it'll be easier to handle more responsibilities in the future.0 comments0"

He might want to take up some skill set while getting a decent pay by taking skillfuture earn and learn program. Which allow him to study for 1 year while working with company.If he is interested in investing for current earning $1,500 situation. He should set a side 9 month of salary for emergency fund and I would suggest to put this fund to CIMB bank with 1% PA interest without any spend or GIRO bill requirement.He can even put the fund in SSB untouch to earn higher interest per year.Then he can thought about investing and do some research. For myself I start investing on STI ETF early 30.This is just a suggestion to take.0 comments0"

WizardAnswered on 14 May 2019Without knowing the person's expenses and financial committments, I would not give a hard target like 20k.Everyone have different financial situation, some have family or kids to take care etc.What I can say is save as much as you can. If you have a career goal, go for it. Still young can venture out to find better opportunities, or maybe go back to studies too.0 comments0"
