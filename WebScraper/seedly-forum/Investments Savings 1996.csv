1,"Luke HoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 27 Mar 2019If you're looking for short term, p2p is a good area to explore and I can help you with that. You can make like 10% net of fees. There are obvious risks, which you should know about - what will happen if it defaults, difficulty compounding effectively, capital amount, etc - but I think that it would be good for someone with your current experience and capital.I do not think you should overlook a long term plan unless you think you can retire on your capital, as impressive as it is for your age. If you are looking for better long term options than the STI ETF, which is decidedly unimpressive, we can look at an aggressive portfolio yielding between 8 - 14% annualized instead. You can always drop me a message on FB. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 25 Mar 2019I would suggest to go for SSB.SSB is a 10 year bond BUT you can withdraw the money anytime with just 1 month notice period. Plus, you get a pro-rated interest if you do early withdrawal.Interest is pretty decent too without any conditions to be met.0 comments0"
