question,"Credit Card Savings DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card DBS Expenses Tracking Asked by AnonymousAsked on 06 Aug 2019Can you share how you track your credit card expenses and miles rewarded (e.g. on Excel)? Just got my first credit card (DBS Altitude Card) and would like to know if there’s any good system on how I can track my expenses and miles awarded. PS. Using DBS here, so Seedly won’t apply!1 answerAnswerBump0"

WonderkidAnswered on 14 Aug 2019As a fellow DBS CC user I feel your pain.What I'm currently doing is manually entering into the seedly app as I find it the most convenient (no need to remember and key in at home, can track immediately).I have reduced the SMS alert for my card to anything over a $1 transaction. This way I have a record of most of my CC spend on my SMS to double check.Lastly, I check the ibanking record every week as there are certain transactions that are not SMS to me (like recurring transaction for phone bills)0 comments1"
