Afterwards will throw them away cuz past expiry date.Not having a plan. Without a plan, you’re planning to fail.Not including some debts(credit/home/etc) into their own financial statement as they are too embarrassed/self conscious about it.0 comments3"

Could sign and sell the phone instead. These are some hacks which can beat Sim only plans. Of course, do your due diligence"

MasterAnswered on 16 Jun 2019Being enticed into purchases by these wordings...OFFER!!DISCOUNT!!FIRE SALES!!TODAY ONLY!!/LIMITED TIME!!!ADD ONLY $XX/$0.XX FOR XXX!!!BEST VALUE!!!NEVER-AGAIN SALES!!YOU WILL NOT REGRET!!! (Actually you will lol)Instead, hold your cash back and return a week later if you really need to buy.(1) IF you need to, you'd buy regardless because you can't wait.(2) IF you can wait, you can wait for the next sales.(3) IF the next sales doesn't happen; (1) will happen. IF (1) doesn't happen, it means (2) can happen. Repeat the process and you'd notice you actually don't need it at all = save money (hooray!)0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 18 Nov 2018Can boil down to FOMO for me, say coupons are expiring and they are enticing me to apply it before a certain date. They even extend the deadline for the coupon. Book depository has been doing this to me and a major part of my library is all thanks to this.. 0 comments0"
9,Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Spending to save.Buying endowment plans / topping up srs / topping up cpf / any other similar forced savings when it would have done better in a multiplier bank account or when you are unsure if you will ever see that money when you really need it.3 comments1
10,See all 3 comments Lok Yang Teng21 Nov 2018Hmm...I agree endowment plans aren't really helping (esp where ROI is lesser than expected and principal not guaranteed) but I do think topping up CPF helps! You get tax relief (1) and accrue higher interest rates normally one wouldn't be able to get (2) Elsa Goh23 Nov 2018Personal opinion bah. The way they keep locking up the money scares me.
