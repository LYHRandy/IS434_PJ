1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 07 Feb 2019Considering your risk appetite (wow quite a lot in bonds),4% returns can be easily gained through your CPF SA / MA account. Alternatively, you may want to invest in your parents CPF accounts (for the first 30k at 6% and the next 30k at 5%) and Children's CPF account (for the first 60k for 5%).For higher risk appetite, you may wish to look into REITS for higher dividend gains (but do not fall into the high dividend trap). Look for those with positive free cash flow for sustainability of such REITs / Stocks.For the stock market, ABF Bond fund may be a suitable one, though it can hardly hit 4% in my humble opinion.0 comments0"
