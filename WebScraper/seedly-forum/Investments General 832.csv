All investments carry risk. The safest instrument you may wish to consider that will provide a form of 'side-income' will be Singapore Savings Bonds which will pay out twice a year, and are quite low cost to get into, with a minimum requirement of $500.0 comments6"

God of WisdomUpdated on 04 Jul 2019Though it's great to try and get your feet wet, I'd say you can hold off for awhile. Even if let's say you invest 1k and earn a 5% return after a year, it's just 50 bucks. Something you can earn giving tuition for an hour or two.Focus on gaining the knowledge first, and also due to the fact that you're mentioning about a sure win product just shows that you aren't familiar enough with the investment markets.Once you built up a sizeable capital plus set aside an emergency cash reserve and equipped with better knowledge, should you dip your feet. Till then, earn a side income by getting a side hustle.0 comments4"
