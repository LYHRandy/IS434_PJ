1,"Victor Chng, Co-Founder at Fifth Person Pte LtdLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 21 Feb 2019Hi,There is a reason why the share price had fallen so much. Therefore, when it comes to investing, you may not want to catch a falling knife. The key is whether the company is able to recover from the current state. At the moment, the company debt level is quite high and some of their currency are hedge using the old Rupiah rate. Rupiah had fallen a lot against the Singapore Dollar. Hence, there is a high probability that the dividend may decrease in the future. 0 comments0"
