Grand MasterAnswered 3w agoAbout $45,000 USD in Nasdaq stock market over a few weeks in 2019I was overeager to pile on my stocks from a few profitable months and overlooked diversification.... haha.Had to use options (calls) to squeeze back some profits. Thankfully most of the losses are profits from a few months ago.but still a painful lesson. :D0 comments2"
2,"Bryan C.Level 2. RookieAnswered 2w agoHi Anonymous!While I have not personally made any big loss while investing in the stock market, I thought that it would be nice if I could share a piece of news that not many might be aware of! The Straits Times Index Exchange Traded Funds (STI ETF) is an index that tracks the performance of Singapore's top 30 companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX). While many people might suggest having a look at STI ETF as their first investment product due to its ability to invest in a wide basket of stocks at low cost, the maximum loss that the STI suffered was about -50% in 1998 and 2008, due in part to the Asian and Global Financial Crisis! Therefore it would be imperative to note that while the STI ETF can provide you with a decent return of about 6% a year, these losses can be normal due to the cyclical nature of the financial world.(https://solutions.kristal.ai/seedlypost)0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered 3w agoI made a loss of around $5,000 when my brother recommended me a penny stock which I invested in based on a stock tip. That was sometime back when I was in my university days.Ever since then, I have stuck to investing for the long game and that you should never invest based on just tips or ideas from friends/family.Stick to blue-chip, index funds, and ETFs.0 comments0"
