1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Could you specify why is it hard? Is it hard to find the suitable job or you didn't qualify for the jobs you have in mind? There are many portals available for those job hunting and there are quite a few related to finance. If all else fails, you could write in to the Big4 (or other smaller firms) for an internship opportunity with them.2 comments0"
2,"Question Poster11 Dec 2018Hi, sorry for not being clear enough. Difficult as in all the jobs are simple admin job which I can’t really learn anything or build my resume. Had thought of getting internship but I wanna use this time to save more money so I can pay off my student loan earlier.Lok Yang Teng11 Dec 2018True, jobs you find on online portals usually aren't that high level per say. By any luck, maybe you'll find something relevant on Straits Times, if not it'll have to be on your own initiative writing in looking for temp jobs."
