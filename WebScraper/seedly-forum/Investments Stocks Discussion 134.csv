What was the reason that drove up the price movement? 2) Is it at 52 week highs? How are the buying / selling volumes now?3) How are the cash flows of the company? (positive cashflows?)4) Is the dividend payout ratio increasing?5) Is the Earnings per Share increasing?Behind a decision is a lot of investigative work, just keep asking why and the answer will come to light0 comments0"
2,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 24 Jun 2019If you like the business model of the stock, do you also like the products and services it offers? Loosely speaking if you do and you're comfortable with the dividend payout rate, then you should keep the stock. But if the fundamentals have changed, especially when you feel the products and services are no longer as they are, then it's time to let the stock go.0 comments0"

Business outlook start to look bad, profits down, management changed to bad one etcMaybe the capital gain = 2-3 years of future dividend, you might consider to sell.Based on chart analysis, is it on uptrend or downtrend, reaching the previous highs, or lows.Keep long term for dividend and ignore price movement.0 comments0"
