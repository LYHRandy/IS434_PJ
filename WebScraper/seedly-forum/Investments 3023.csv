1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Nov 2018Didn't use the platform myself but doubt whether layman like us can profit by copying traders. Those people (technical anaysis) trade by the seconds and I dont think the platform can do instantenous transactions. Commerical traders have more room to work with since they have massive funds (0.1% gain could for them be earning thousands, but loss for you since you have transactional cost on both ends). Recommend following your own instinct rather than blindly following other traders.0 comments0"
