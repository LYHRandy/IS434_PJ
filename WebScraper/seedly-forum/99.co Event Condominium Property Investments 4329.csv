Douglas here. 2nd keynote speaker.It;s pretty ok to rely on the mortgage banker recommended though it's your choice entirely to source your own. Some of my clients rely on my mortgage bankers while others rely on their own long time mortgage bankers, esp my high net worth clients who already have their own private bankers.​​​
