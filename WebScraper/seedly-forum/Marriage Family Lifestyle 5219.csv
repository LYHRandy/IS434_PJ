I'll share a bit more on what i think about traditions:
1) Engagement:  I think engagement is a total waste of $ especially the ring. Since we'll then proceed with ROM etc. If it fails then it's an even wasteful events of wasting $.2) Proposal: Proposal can be something nice to create a good memories, not necessary a must. Just casually ask her for what she think the idea proposal should be as a easy going relax topics to find out more. Also share your opinions and discuss to understand each other's stand.  For some girls, it's once in a life time, so they want it to be memorable, in this case as long as it's not wasting too much $, then try to do it more DIY, ask some friend to help manually , preparing, so it's meaningful, memorable and loving. You'll both remember forever.
Some girls doesn't mind, as long as you both love each and focus more on housing and building a successful marriage and family together is more important.
3) Wedding Dinner @ Hotel / Restaurant:I do see peole spending 5 to 6 figure for it. The end just a one night events eating, drinking. Most of the $ goes to the venue operators. Couple might or might not remember, but it cost too much to remember.  Some rather save it, just have simple lunch and go for honeymoon. Save the $ for housing, renovations and future buildings. You don't want to fight over wedding debts after marriage, it's rather damaging and a sure way to ruin a marriage which could have been happy.
The key is still what do both of you want.  Discuss with each other, give and take decide what you want. Next stand firm with each other and convince the parents to only let u guys do what you want to avoid doing things for the sake of doing it without extracting meanings from it.
It's a life, it's a love reunion that you both celebrate and gonna build a wonderful future for a happy family and kids, that's what most important than anything else.
All the best! Cheers :D May you both be Happy always in whatevery you decide to do :)0 comments1"
