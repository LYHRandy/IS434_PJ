question,"CPF SeedlyTV EP06 Asked by AnonymousAsked on 31 Jul 2019Would you use Medisave for hospital delivery?Hi folks, for those who are proactively squirrelling money into their SA / MA to build up their retirement nest for maximum compounding effort, I'd like to ask if you would consider not using MA to pay for hospital delivery? Say you have some spare cash, perhaps you would use a credit card to pay it off instead of using MA and let MA earn 4%. Pls share your thoughts. Thanks!2 answersAnswerBump0"
