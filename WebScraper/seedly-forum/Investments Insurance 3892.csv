God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Apr 2019The yield on a life insurance plan is about 3+% per annum over 20-30+ years.If you're risk adverse and don't want any exposure to stocks, insurance plans can give you compounded bond like returns. Also they are backed by A rated and above companies. So it's practically investment grade. An alternative would be to look at CPF Special Account.0 comments0"
