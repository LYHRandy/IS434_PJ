1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey! I also had this question when I first started flying on my own.I would say, just create a free Krisflyer account! You can create one for free here: https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/ppsclub-krisflyer/registration-form/Not only for the Amex krisflyer, but every other points card, if you would want to collect krisflyer points, this is how to do it and your krisflyer account is the place to collect them. 2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster08 Nov 2018Hi Kenneth! Thanks for answering my question. But when I start spending on my Amex card, would the krisflyer points be accumulated in my Amex account or the Krisflyer account? How do I link the Krisflyer account to my Amex card?Kenneth Lou08 Nov 2018Lol. If im not wrong it will be accumulated in your Amex account, but you'll have to convert it to Krisflyer miles. That's how it works for other cards like CITI premier miles and DBS points... but im not the clearest with Amex!"

MasterAnswered on 02 May 2019It depends on what the AMEX card is.If yours is AMEX Rewards Card, then you earn AMEX membership rewards points, which is stored in your AMEX account till you are ready to redeem.If yours is AMEX Krisflyer Blue, then no, you must have a Krisflyer account. Or else AMEX would not know where to credit the points to and you might lose them.0 comments0"
