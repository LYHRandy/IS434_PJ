question,"Investments Stocks Discussion Property Asked by AnonymousAsked on 27 Aug 2019Given the current global economic outlook, what are the options if I have 20k cash to invest with, and looking at roughly 5% p.a. over 5 to 10 years?How should I be investing, single premium or DCA? My current idea is to diversify by splitting into STI ETF (Nikko AM or SPDR STI), bond (not sure which), and REIT ETF (probably lion Philip because it has 30 assets underneath). Any thoughts are welcome!3 answersAnswerBump1"

I personally won't invest because I prefer higher returns instruments like stocks. I am holding most of my cash waiting for a stock market correction.....2 comments4"

Thanks for sharing. üôÇJessica Ann Lee29 Aug 2019Agree with you. Have to make sure this business offering the loan has a proper structural and is long enough in business to have incentives. I read the history, seems like it started long time ago lending money to Uber and Grab drivers"

Ya I read about the inverted yield too and that it is the sign of incoming recession but not immediately. 
Sounds like a good idea to stay out of equity for the moment.
Any thoughts on investing in REITs now?"

When you do lumpsum investment ie single premium, you are betting that your point of entry being a favourable price.When you DCA, you remove that uncertainty at the cost of a lower return.Does your CPF Balance have 60k? The first 60k will achieve a bonus interest of 1%, which would mean if you put your fund in CPF SA, you earn a guaranteed interest of 5%. If you are yet to achieve it, I would suggest you do so. While CPF monies above 20k in the OA and 40k in the SA can be used for the CPF investment funds, the guaranteed returns from CPF would make for a weak argument for do so, especially SA monies which earn a nice 4% guaranteed interest.
Another way is to consider putting it into SRS- you  gain tax relief for doing so, then use the amount to buy into Unit Trusts or Stashaway- apparently, MoneyOwl and Endowus who are carrying the excellent Dimensional Fund are in the midst of becoming SRS certified.Personally, I feel that the markets are overvalued now. Am waiting for the market crash then go all in:)You can set up your very own Dividend Re-Investment Plan(DRIP) for REITS.Do your due diligence and select well established market leader eg MapletreePlough back your dividends every year and watch your nest egg growStep 3(Optional): Set aside some of your annual bonus and add to your sum7 comments1"
