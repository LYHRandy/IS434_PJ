1,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You may want to check with MOM. The Employment Act and Work Injury Compensation Act cover employees engaged under a contract of service. This includes internships if there is a contract of service signed between the intern and the employer.However, for internships that students undergo as part of their academic course requirements in schools, they will not be subjected to the legal provisions in the EA and WICA. https://www.mom.gov.sg/faq/employment-act/as-an-intern-am-i-covered-under-the-employment-act-or-the-work-injury-compensation-act1 comment1"
