question,"Rent Family Marriage HDB BTO Asked by AnonymousAsked on 30 Mar 2019Is it better to rent a flat to stay together as a couple first or just wait for a bto flat which would take few years? As young adults in the workforce for 1ish year, we don’t have enough money to buy a resale flat and get married. However as I am living alone I want to live with my bf as soon as possible. I’m also not open to the idea of staying with his family (cos ppl always say there will be conflicts). Is it better to just stay alone first and wait for bto?1 answerAnswerBump0"
