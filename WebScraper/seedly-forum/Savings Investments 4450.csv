God of WisdomAnswered on 15 Sep 2019For a start, you will need to ensure that you have an emergency fund in case of emergencies. You will want to ensure that this is at least 6 months of your (estimated) expenses when you start working.After that, ensure that you have at least sufficient critical illness and hospitalization coverage. Your parents might have gotten you some earlier, so you might need to sit down with an independent advisor to see what shortfall you might have and address the gaps.After this, you will be ready to start investing. As you are still young, spend time to gain knowledge to see what your risk appetite is, and what sort of asset classes may suit you. Again, an independent advisor will be able to guide you through this.Platforms wise, you can consider POEMS as it is a multi-asset platform which has most asset classes on board.The savings account will depend on your expenditure patterns, etc. Depending on that, most people will use either OCBC 360 or DBS multiplier. To maximise usage, consider first if you are a cashback or miles person. I have answered several questions similar to yours, so browse my history to get slightly more in-depth answers.0 comments4"

RookieAnswered on 13 Sep 2019I think for a start it will be good for you to put your money in Citibank Maxigain if you will not be using, preferably at least $15K for a start to build counters because this account once you reach $70K gives you more than 2.5% interest without doing anything (on current SIBOR rate).
Another good savings account will be CIMB Fastsaver, which gives you up to 1% fuss-free without needing to meet any requirements except having $1K in it.
For stocks, it will be better you take some time to read more about it before going to it as the risks are slightly higher.0 comments0"
