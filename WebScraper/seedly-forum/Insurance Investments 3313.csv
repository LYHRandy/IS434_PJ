question,"Insurance Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 28 Sep 2018Why not many people have precious metals in their portfolio?I’m a silver stacker and I dollar cost average silver by buying the estimated lowest price of the month. I think having precious metals are an opportunity not to be missed. After all, it’s been money for thousands of years. Also, there are a lot of people buying Crypto than precious metals, which puzzles me. I don’t get why quantity of currency is better than quality of the intrinsic value.5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Jay Liu, Sleepyhead at Land of Dreams Level 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018Precious metals don't distribute dividends. Its more of an insurance than an investment to me. Crypto, mostly FOMO. I've an camp mate that bought some coin and now dk whether how much is it worth. But that time, they were all hyped out about it. Now, they don't even talk about it anymore. 0 comments1"

3,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 28 Sep 2018People buying crypto are either just following the herd or those who really see deep value in them in the long term future. Most are the first type, following the herds and crypto millionaires (seems all missing now?)​Precious metals usually form a small portion of portfolio because they do not produce dividends or growth. Their value is determined by supply and demand and the price people are willing to pay for it. It is different from a business where the business can grow or earn profits.0 comments1"
4,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Sep 2018Precious metals are more like a hedge in downturn economic cycles. The prices have been steadily decreasing over the years, at least for gold going by the price of my gold ETF I bought a few years ago.​Crypto wise, the in thing now from what I know is bitcoin trading, where you trade it like a stock. A lot of herd mentality in crypto space, and I got onto that for a while at the turn of the year. Lost some money, currently licking the wounds and not venturing into anything new in this space. A lot of experts have warned against crypto, as there are no tangible assets backing it and may just be a bubble looking to burst. The falling prices this year may be the beginning of the end... Tread with extreme care if you are thinking of heading into this. 0 comments0"
