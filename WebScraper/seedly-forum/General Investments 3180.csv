question,General Investments Asked by Sevilla CheaAsked on 27 Oct 2018I'm looking to start investing in REITs. Is FSMOne a suitable platform? ?I don't suppose FSMOne will collapse alongside my investments? it has half the commission fees the other CDP-linked brokerages are charging so it's quite attractive to me.1 answerAnswerBump1
