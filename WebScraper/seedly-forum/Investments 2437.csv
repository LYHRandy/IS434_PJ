3,"TChong Junn26 Feb 2019do u need to exchange from sing dollar to usd?Gabriel Tham26 Feb 2019yes, if you are intending to trade US stocks, you will need USD. There are 2 ways. 

1. You can directly deposit USD, this way lets you choose your own exchange rate
2. Deposit SGD and let broker convert for you. Usually the broker can give a better rate."
4,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Feb 2019I use Saxo and I think the platform is pretty decent(low comission per trade, fair custodian fees per month. Also heard good things from TD Ameritrade's flat commision of 14usd per trade(no custodian fees).I believe seedly did a comparison before. You should definitely do some research before choosing one- you will probably be doing most transactions from one broker for convenience!https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-cheapest-stock-brokerage-in-singapore/0 comments0"

Personally I use Td Ameritrade and its a simple to use platform with powerful charting tools. Great for options as well if you are into that 0 comments0"
