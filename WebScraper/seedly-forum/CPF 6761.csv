Help her to achieve a basic level of guaranteed lifetime income. Enjoy tax relief while you are at it too. Since we don't know how long we will live, having that lifetime income is even more important.0 comments5"
2,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 13 Sep 2019I am going contrarian thinking. But it depends whether you are looking to
(1) maximise value, or(2) Insure for life-long income.If you wish for (1), you have to understand that the payouts will run out at age 91, since she will be on the Retirement Sum Scheme.But if she has CPF combined 60k, they are already earning 6%/5% interest, so it's also 1 way to ask yourself, do you want to use those interest to fund her too?Speak to me for a detailed explanation as it will involve a long talk and strategic placement.0 comments0"
3,"Eric Chia, Senior Financial Consultant at PrudentialLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Jul 2019She may already have met the minimum $60k requirement. You may like to check if any money was withdrawn at 55yo to pay for cpf life premiums. By right half of the retirement sum should have been used by cpf at 55yo.Otherwise, yes you can consider topping up cpf for your mom, you may also like to check the details on IRAS website there should be tax relief for doing so (if I remember right).0 comments0"
