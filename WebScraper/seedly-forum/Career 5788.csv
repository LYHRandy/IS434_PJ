1,"Elsa GohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019For guys: tailored clothing can make a big difference. Go for mature hairstyles. Ask your friends if you look older with or without glasses, buy glasses or contacts accordingly. If u really feel there is a need to, get glasses eith no degree if glassea make you look more mature.For women: longer hair makes you look older, so grow it out. Learn how to put on makeup - lots of tutorials for that. Go for officewear, tailored if possible. Wear high heels. Same tip about glasses.For either gender, be confident. Fake it till you make it. Dont betray your consternation when people mistake you for an intern, just smile and inform them confidently that you are the manager (?) And u can assist them. Over time your poise and confidence will grow. 5 comments6"

3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 26 Mar 2019I have a friend who has the same issue! If you are a woman, that is an otherwise awesome situation to be in. Apart from what you wear and changes to your outwardly self, your demeanour, posie and personality is key. Imagine: if you are a very cute and bubbly lady, and decide to dress up in heels and wear an 'OL' dress - people still probably won't take you more seriously just because you are now tottering in heels with make up on. Honestly, as a female myself and having pounded in CBD in heels, I am not a big fan of wearing heels because of the long term effects to the spine. Likewise, if you are a very cute and bubbly guy, and decide to grow some facial hair and dress more dapper - if you are still the baby in the group due to your demeanour, it will still remain the same.0 comments3"

Dressing and grooming as others have suggested does help. Next is also how we behave in terms of how we speak and carry ourselves matters too. At times when clients comment on me looking very young, I will smile and say Thank you for the compliment and continue to speak in a calm and confident manner. Usually after a while, they know that I could assist them, they will trust me. For some more friendly clients, I will still say thank you & will joke that unfortunately not really that young anymore. Even with colleagues, i behave the same way. Over time they also learn to respect and trust me more. At times, in meeting really demanding clients, we might not be able to do much. We can try to speak to the client patiently but if the client insist of seeing someone more ""senior"", just don't take it too personally. Now that I have reached a certain age, I actually start to appreciate this ""look younger"" issue. hahaa1 comment3"

For women, perhaps you can start putting on light makeup?
Looking young is not a bad thing and there are some clients who are not worth being angry. I have this issue too but usually after talking to me, people will realise my maturity. 0 comments2"

9,"Xinyi Lum, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Dec 2018Got compelled to leave an answer after reading this because of the nature of your issue at hand - physical appearance. Dressing and the way you carry yourself are definitely the top things to polish right now if you want people to take you more seriously, but perhaps start with small actions first.Simple things like taking more time to pause while conversing with someone, or speaking slower and with more articulation can give off a more wise vibe. Might sound rather ridiculous but I think it works! Just don't go over the top ;-)0 comments0"
