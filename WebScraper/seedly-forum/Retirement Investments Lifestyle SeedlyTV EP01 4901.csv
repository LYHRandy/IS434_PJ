1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Time with family is more important than just spending money on them. You can spend alot money on family but once they are gone, you cannot buy them back. Time is so much more valuable. Of course if you can afford to, then no issues spending money and time together. A simple meal everyday together makes a difference. Special occassions eat restaurants. Home cooked food is always the best.2 comments2"
2,"Tee-Ming Chew27 Mar 2019Agree on this. You want to spend quality time with family and that should be priorityKKhriz27 Mar 2019Say your bank gives you a 5-day offer to put into an FD that offers 5% pa, do you take it or put more money into your ETF portfolio? Of course you take it.

Family and loved ones are not ""spending"" ; I see it as a time-limited investment. Once you missed the opportunity, no money can buy it back anymore. Planning for retirement can be done anytime, and who knows what other investment opportunities you will have in future?"
3,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Mar 2019I would definitely value spending quality, enjoyable time with family and loved ones. It does not need to be extravagant meals and holidays - for example, making the point to ask your parents to go for a walk and a meal at East Coast Park makes for a fun time without spending too much money. Or even if you are busy at work, calling them and sending them a text message to tell them you care is always good. For example, on the days where I can't meet my dad for dinner - I will prepare a mixed berry yogurt bowl and leave it for him in the fridge. Small gestures. You can always check how much money you have left in the bank, but you can't check how much time we have left.0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 28 Mar 2019We spend time to get money, so that in the later years, we get to spend more time (since our earning ability may likely take a hit, or even health may take a hit).But still, we require to spend time to maintain the relationship. Life is all about balance, and the balance is an agreement between family members. I can't use my yardstick to give you what to do, how much time to spend, and what are the activities that all would want to participate in.But What i can give is a guideline, that if they think you are not spending enough quality time (and seriously that can be a deal breaker for a lot of family), then perharps its time to reduce the time spent. Having enough is the key (and how much is enough, its to be agreed between the family members).0 comments0"
5,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 27 Mar 2019I think, spending on family is to create good memories together. Good or happy memories may not necessary need to spend a lot of $ together. Consider some budget friendly options such as go nearby park or botanic garden for picnic, cycling. Share a netflix account with friends and stream in at home tv for movie nights, go for a walk during the many lights and arts events on weekend by NAC. With that , you can lean towards spending only 20 to 30% on family / love ones on happy memory creations and the balance 70 to 80% on investment regularly to create your own retirement nest eggs  with also your love one (partners) and be around for your children when you retire, to continue to create happy memories with them and even their kids your grandchildren! :) Have a good life, balance creating happy memories with love one and retired happily and continue to spend time creating happy memories with love ones! :)0 comments0"
