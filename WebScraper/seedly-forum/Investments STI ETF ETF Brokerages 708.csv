GeniusUpdated on 08 Aug 2019If you are buying STI ETF for long term accumulation and you can only afford 300-500 per month, it would be more optimal to go with DBS Invest Saver (RSP)If you are considering buying foreign ETF, consider Interactive Broker.

WizardUpdated on 08 Aug 2019Buy via DBS/POSB under the invest tab, as the key here is regular (Regular Savings Plan - RSP) to achieve DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging),  for longer term this platform as it is automated self services, so the fees is much lower than regular brokerage.
