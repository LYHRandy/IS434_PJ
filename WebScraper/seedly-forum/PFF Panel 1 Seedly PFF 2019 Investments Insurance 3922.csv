2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 01 Mar 2019Hello!I personally feel that both investments and insurance ae equally important as both will affect our long term financial well-being. However, if you are thinking in terms of which you should start first I personally think that insurance would be more important as a start since it is primarily meant for protection. Once you have the capital to start investing you should then invest as soon as possible! hope this helps!0 comments1"
