question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Sep 2019Any recommendations for investments as an alternative to cash contribution to parents?I am planning to give $500 to my parents/month, but instead of putting that money in the bank, I am thinking of investing it. I would like something that allows me to take out the money easily when I need to. Any recommendations?3 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomAnswered on 09 Sep 2019If this money is meant to support your parents, then you may wish to keep it liquid. In this case, a large number of options are off the table. A mixture of high yield, no-hurdle savings account such as CIMB fastsaver (protected by SDIC), and money market fund as what Hariz suggested would work out well in terms of averaged returns and diversification.
Take note that while funds in CIMB can be transferred to any bank via FAST instantly, money in money market funds has one working day delay to be transferred to your bank.0 comments4"

God of WisdomUpdated on 09 Sep 2019I'm assuming you don't want to take any risk on this $500/mth contribution.You may want to look at Money Market funds available via Fundsupermart or Phillip Securities. It has a 1.5+% return and is fully liquid.Here's an example: https://unittrust.poems.com.sg/all-about-funds/fund-finder/?fc=534010&_ga=2.114838919.1041177504.1568019764-1394855837.15669139730 comments2"
3,"T@Takingstock @Level 5. GeniusUpdated on 09 Sep 2019Just to make sure I understand your question, the options aregive 500 cash per mth to your parentsbuy 500 worth of investments either in your name or your parents' name.Have you asked what they wanted?
I have been thru this phase before, even though I am a better investor than my parents, end of the day I have to respect their wishes on what they would like to do with the money.Even if they use the money I gave them for donations, or they use it to buy diapers for their grandchildren (not mine).Otherwise, it's not really like you are giving them money... You become like another CPF board who holds money they can't touch...How about trying this?
I gave my parents education on SSBs and tell them to consult me if they want to invest. But I am only a consultant with no fee charged. They make the decisions for their money.Make the decision together in discussion. They could have things they really want to pay for, and not invest.0 comments0"
