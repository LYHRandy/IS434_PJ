1,"Lok Yang TengLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Dec 2018Whether to have shared account varies from couple to couple. Some may prefer equal sharing of roles, while some may prefer that their partners are unable to afford so (big wage difference, doesn't look good on the partner's part). It is hard to advise without knowing situation of the family. Generally, the couple should sit down and discuss about it to ensure there'll be no dispute in the future (as to someone paying more etc.).0 comments0"
