WizardAnswered on 03 Oct 2018As kenneth shared, go iBanking via desktop to either:1) reduce , lowest at $100or 2) have to cancel the whole monthly RSP. ​if your POSB Cashback Bonus Saver or DBS Multiplier depends on this as the transaction ( valid as the 3rd transaction for 12 month only), then you can cancel and don't subscribe for 6 months then resubscribe again. ​​0 comments1"

If I'm not wrong you can simply go into the iBanking to stop the deduction under the 'invest' section.​Should be really straight forward? :) However, maybe you would consider to reduce it to the minimum of $100 per month? To continue to dollar cost average over this period. Something to think about! Up to you :)0 comments1"
