1,"Jim Tay, Director at Jimtay.comLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 05 Mar 2019Heard about them and went for their introductory seminar.Actually what they are doing is nothing new. It has been around for a while now, ever since the government first introduced ABSD as a cooling measure for residential properties in 2011.Never felt keen enough to sign up though, so I wont say much about the course per se, just that I feel that when it comes to industrial property, it is sunset, with high yields balanced by short leases on the property.0 comments0"

I think their method works (not too sure how it works) but i dont like property investments in Singapore to begin with.Some say they do leverage or  like a group of 20 share 1 property something like that.0 comments0"
