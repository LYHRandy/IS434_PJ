You have to figure out your1) Risk Profile (Are you risk averse or more high risk taker?)2) Investment Horizon (2 years, 5 years, 10 years?)​Instead of choosing one, why not have both? Blue ChipIt's good to pick some blue chip companies which have decent both capital gains and dividends if you have an future outlook of the particularly company or sector. ETFETF can act as a ""safety net"" in all markets conditions as you are diversifying in different industries and you are accumulating more shares when the share price is dipping. (Wall Street coined this as ""Average Down"").​If you do not know how to allocate % of your capital into BC and ETF, you could take 100 - (Your Age) and that is the percentage that you will be vested in equity, ETF or even bonds.​E.g (100 - 20) = 80% Equity (Stocks) - 80%ETF - 20%0 comments0"

ProdigyAnswered on 19 Jul 2018I believe this is the question on many people minds.I feel that it depends on one's risk profile and the time he/she wishes to spend on looking at the stock markets.For handsfree approach, go for sti. The more it drops, the better the bargain.For higher growth, its good to pick some blue chips which are giving decent dividend yields and you are convinced of its future growth prospects OR that its undervalued.0 comments0"
