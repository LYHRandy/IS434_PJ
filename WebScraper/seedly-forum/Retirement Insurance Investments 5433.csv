question,"Retirement Insurance Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 16 Sep 2019Why do the returns on Life payment annuity and fixed-term annuity payout differ so much?I am a 25 yo, planning to put 300/month for retirement planning currently. I was doing some research on Income plans (only they have online quotes AFAIK)Why is there such a big difference in payouts 630/Year (till 100) vs 373.93/month (starting 60 year old for 20 years)Should I be getting a Life Annuity Plan or a Fixed payout annuity plan for X years for retirement planning purposes? it seems like fixed payout is more worth it.Feel free to drop me an email at tobss93@gmail.com for quotes.2 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomUpdated on 18 Sep 2019It's not one or the other but how much of each.Retirement can be broken up into two parts. Active retirement where you're still travelling and spending money, and passive retirement where you're just too old and unable to be out and about.During active retirement, you'll need more money, and during passive retirement, you'll probably need less.So you can have 2 plans, a limited payout plan for active retirement with a base lifetime annuity for both active and passive retirement.3 comments3"

3,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 17 Sep 2019What kind of comparison are you using?It seems like a comparison for CPF LIFE and Annuity Plan by another insurer.There are differences between the 2 if you realised:(1) CPF LIFE - The payouts drawdown from your capital, and it depletes once it reaches a certain age. The insurer is pooling the risk from everyone (those who pass off earlier, pays for those who are still alive). As such, they can afford to give higher payouts even with the same amount(2) Fixed Term annuities - They are drawing down from the possible dividends that can be gotten (the bonuses), and are trying to preserve your capital. As such, it draws much less in terms of the amount. They are able to leave a bequest or even mature to provide another lump sum. (after your maturity date).1 comment0"
