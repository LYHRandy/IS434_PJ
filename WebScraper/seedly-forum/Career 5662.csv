1,"Jacqueline YanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 25 Aug 2019I suppose this depends on the culture at your workplace, is it more sensitive towards such topics? Also how close you are with these colleagues?
I recently gone through something similar and to most of the colleagues, I told them that I had my own appointments. But to the closer ones, I did share that I was going for a job interview.2 comments2"

The only time I did personally was when the whole team was interviewing for other jobs, because of the toxic culture in the company.Otherwise, I have seen cases where some nosey gossip mongers spread the word, and if it reaches HR, HR tells your manager, Manager comes to you to ask you what's going on (especially if it's a difficult manager), then GG.0 comments1"
4,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 21 Aug 2019I think it depends on what kind of colleagues you have. If you don't feel like it's 'safe' telling your colleagues, then don't. But if your colleagues are trustworthy and won't backstab you by telling your bosses that you are leaving soon, then sure, just tell :)0 comments0"
