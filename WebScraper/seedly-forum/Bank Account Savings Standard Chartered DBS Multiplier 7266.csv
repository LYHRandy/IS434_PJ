1,"Low San ZengLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated 3w ago##edit: SCB interest still stay as 2% even after you pass 27 as confirmed by the community, though it's up to the bank discretion whether to maintain this interest in the distant future##Standard Chartered JumpStart account can guarantee a 2% p.a. interest for up to 20k. The account does not have any penalty if you fall below any minimum account. The SCB debit card also has a 1% rebate for any amount spent, capped at a rebate of 60 dollars.Whereas for DBS Multiplier, you would first need to credit your salary and transact in one or more of the categories (credit card spend, home loan instalment, insurance, investments). DBS Multiplier advertised that you can get up to 3.8% p.a. interest BUT that is if you achieve total eligible transactions of more than or equal to 30k a month, AND already have 50k in this DBS Multiplier account AND transactions in 3 or more categories. This means that to hit the 30k a month, say you credit 5k salary a month to your account, you need to have another 25k or more in your other transactions (credit card, home loan instalment, insurance and investment)! So realistically speaking, most undergraduate would only be able to hit the 1.85% p.a. tier (whereby total eligible transactions per month is 2.5k to 5k).

dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-earn/multiplierSo in my opinion, I would open both accounts. SCB jumpstart account would kinda be my savings account whereby if you have spare cash saved from either your part-time work or parents allowance last time, I would just dump the money there to treat it as a ""fixed deposit"". The interest paid here is even higher than most fixed deposit currently in Singapore.For the DBS Multiplier, I would treat it as a ""spending account"" whereby spending with the credit card can allow you to get back better rebates than the SCB debit card. (Do note some DBS/POSB credit cards have minimum spending to get back rebates) dyodd!If you already have 20k in your SCB, then just leave the rest of the money in your DBS Multiplier to earn the DBS Multiplier interest since SCB jumpstart interest is capped up to 20k. Once you hit 27 or older, your salary would probably have increased such that you would be able to hit the higher tier of DBS Multiplier and earn better interest. This will coincide with the age limit of SCB jumpstart and can just transfer your money to DBS Multiplier if necessary.These are just my opinions so you should plan out your financial means and how to allocate a portion of your salary to the jumpstart account if you do follow my advice on opening two accounts.

2,"NNinja4w agoFake news lol. The jumpstart account remains at 2% if total amount in bank is less than $20000. Above 27 years old does not reduce the ratesLow San Zeng4w agoOhh is it? Cos that time I went to the scb bank and ask about the interest rate after 27, the person said just take it will go back to 0.1%. So I'm not 100% sure on this"

WizardAnswered 3w agoSeems like the community has confirmed: THE INTEREST RATE WONT BE REDUCED AFTER YOU TURN 27 AND OLDER 2%P.A ON YOUR FIRST $20K""Spoke to SC customer service, they confirmed the interest rate will not be reduced after you turn 27 and older..""2 comments1"

Grand MasterAnswered 4w agoIf you can do salary credit, DBS multiplier has higher than 2% (up to 3.8%) https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-earn/multiplier I will choose this so that I can do my transactions and aim up to 3.8%If you cannot do salary credit, SCB JumpStart is better with 2%. I will choose that if I cannot do salary credit.0 comments0"
