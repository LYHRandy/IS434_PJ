WizardAnswered on 08 Aug 2018Hi ​(A) Property: Need to take course and pass the CEA exam.Yearly have CPD hours to fulfill to retain the license.License has yearly cost to maintain.​Pros: Good comm.Cons: MAS cooling measure will means hard for beginners or people who lack the forte or character to do property sales. It involve a lot of hard work such as:1) Understand and master HDB rules (Cherry, Subsidies etc)2) Understand and master URA / SLA rules (for private)3) Understand and master  MAS rules (ABSD, TDSR  etc)4) Learn how to do marketing, sales and convert customer to buyer5) Learn how to do financial planning for customer in terms of budgeting on purchases, loans, existing debts etc6) Need to have enough savings for more than 1 year in case no income7) Need to have some savings for advertisement and paying the cost of license, cost of attending CPD classes while may not have income.8) Be aware of the dark and danger of the trade, eg. Some Developer drag commission by 1 to 2 years and don't pay. ​The main hurder is MAS cooling measures so a lot of agent had quit over the years as it's hard to earn a living. ​Insurance and RM I will leave it to the experts with experience to share.  ​You're in Chemistry, i'm guessing you're not keen to go into the trade for some reason.  Spend some time to think about what is your interest and passion, go to networking session and talk to people in that trade to find out more. That may help you to find a better trade as you will need to spend more than half of your life working on that trade. So it's better to be something you enjoy doing rather than working for the sake of $. It's gonna be like hell for just $ sake. ​All the best ! :) ​​​​0 comments2"
