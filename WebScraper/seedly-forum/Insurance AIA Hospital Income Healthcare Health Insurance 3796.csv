ProdigyAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Hi there, Max Essential A Saver did not change to Vital Health Rider. It's more of a new offer that is compliant with MOH guidelines as what Hariz has mentioned.If you are owning the Max Essential A Saver you can keep it. If you are owning the Max Essential A you can downgrade to either the Essential A Saver or Vital Health A.For age30-40, price gap between Essential A saver and Vital Health is about $50/y only. The essential A Saver rider covers 100% for you and has a possible daily hospital cash if you downgrade. I'd attach my analysis here if you want to know more. Also, contact a qualified adviser to understand further, good luck.https://www.theastuteparent.com/2018/12/aia-healthshield/0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 04 Jun 2019Max Essential A is the old rider that allows full deductible and co insurance coverage. Vital Health is the new rider after MOH passed the new co-pay law.Now you must pay 5% co-insurance up to a cap of $3k per policy year if you visit AIA's Panel of Doctors, no cap otherwise.0 comments1"
