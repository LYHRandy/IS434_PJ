1,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I was on a 1 year overseas internship and school and this are the things I would recommend you to do..​1. Get to know more peopleAlways believe in the power of networking. You will never know who the person you just know can help you in your future. (hint: I met my co-founder Kenneth when I was in San Francisco). Below is a photo of Kenneth and I in a Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco!​​​​2. Join local meetupsAgain to point 1, join local meetups that are interesting to you and meet new people of the same interest. When I was in Sillicon Valley, I attended 2-3 technology meetups every week to learn new things and to meet new people. Highly recommend Meetup.com or any similar sites that are widely used in the country you are going to.​3. Get a internship thereWorking in a overseas company is going to give you different perspective and help you gain experience more. It can also help to secure an option to continue working in the country after graduation. On the surface level, it can help to make your resume stand out (because you worked in a foreign country before) when you're back in Singapore.​4. Learn to be independentAs a fellow Singaporean, most of us are being spoiled by our parents. So take this opportunity to start to learn how to live by yourself (clearning apartment, settle your own meals, do your own laundry and etc).​As for traveling, I did travel extensively when I was there. The way I look at traveling within the country (USA for my case) is that it will cost me more if I were to fly back to USA from Singapore to do the same traveling. Hope that helps!2 comments2"
2,"Serene Toh20 Sep 2018I like no 3. if you can (if scholarship permits) do work for a period there, it does wonders for your resume. Alternatively, you can try temp jobs (but check the law for max hours of students). Even if unglamourous, the temp jobs can gave you a good perspective of live in the other country, great for meeting people & best of all, help fund your travels. (I'm assuming your scholarship is to the more developed nations here)Tee-Ming Chew21 Sep 2018Totally agree on what Serene said! Good way to gain and broaden your perspective of live in other country!"
3,"Serene TohLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Depending on which country you are going to, it is also possible to start practicing your Investing skills there. ​The one thing I regretted the most not doing is to start buying shares while I was in UK. They have custodian accounts there that allow you to start buying with whatever amount you want, prices can be as low as 50 pence, including fees. So it actually makes for good practice. (There are some rules regarding the what to do with the shares after you leave the country though, so do your research well, otherwise might end with major loss)​Travelling is a good option, can use it to train your Budgeting & Planning skills. Just like its cheap to travel within SEA from Singapore. It would be cheaper to make numerous trips close & within to the country you are going, than from Singapore. As good planners, although it is cheaper, go only if it is within your budget.1 comment1"

You never know when opportunities will spring up when you need them.If you have the money, you should travel. For me, travelling soothes my soul. I love seeing new things, talking to new people, eating new food, experiencing new things. It all builds you up and allows you to see things from many different perspectives.0 comments0"

8,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Sep 2018That only happens once while in Uni. Most exciting and happening days of your life.​TryJoin the club or societies in Uni that you're keen. Learns as much and contribute or even be the club president. This will gives good exposure and experience and networking to know people and build connections.Enjoy the time there studying hard and playing hard​Do your best to live every moment as it only happen once in a lifetime during your most energetic age / time. So that there's no regrets later in life when you look back.​With the above you'll have something good to share with your future partner/ kids too.​Finally, do some part time earn some pocket $ too. And before you graduate, just about the end or even during summer holidays ,  if you're around Europe area or even in states , plan with school mate a full country driving tour if is states and Europe for cross country via the cross country train pass!  Make it like a graduation holiday yourself. ​You only graduate Uni once at this age with this bunch of good friends , there won't be another chance as all will go on with their life from there onwards. So go ahead have a great graduate holiday!.  0 comments0"
9,"Justin GuanLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 18 Dec 2018You can work and save for the rest of your life. But you don’t have the rest of your life to study, play and have fun. My advice: stop worrying and start enjoying! Of course, with fun I meant spend wisely and prudently, but don’t save for the sake of saving! Travel around, make new friends, hang out at the bars/clubs (or cafe), spend on nice meals occasionally, etc.Ps. While I was studying abroad, I spent all my allowance away with no savings to lead a life of a lifetime. I had never regretted and I’m not worse-ofd today either.0 comments0"
10,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Jul 2018Yes, you should use the opportunity to travel around different cities. I went on a 6 month internship in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from September 2017 to February 2018. During my time there, I travelled domestically to many different cities such as, Hanoi, Danang, Hoi An, Hue, Vung Tau, and Mui Ne. You should also make use of this opportunity to attend some events to build up your network. I searched for events that I were keen to attend through Facebook events. Hereby wishing you all the best! 0 comments0"
