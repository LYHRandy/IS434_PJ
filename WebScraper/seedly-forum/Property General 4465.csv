God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Minimum to save would be 20% of your income into assets that beat inflation.Housing price I'd keep it to 3-5 X of your household income. So if you're making 50k a year, try to not stay in a house that costs more than 250k.If you're talking about rent, then not more than 20% if your income on rent. 1 comment1"
