2,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 11 Jun 2019Business ProfileSembcorp has come into the light again with Sembcorp Power in place. Outside of the electricity market they also provide essential energy and water solutions to both industrial and municipal customers. They are also a brand name in urban development in Vietnam, China and Indonesia.FinancialsIncome StatementDespite a 30% increase in revenue, gross profit fell by 26% due to a 38% increase in cost of sales. Profit Before Tax as a result also fell, but was buffered by higher operting income, lower non-operating expense and higher finance income.Balance SheetThe company has strong short-term liquidity with a current ratio of close to 5. Morevoer, current assets mainly comprise of cash (75%), which leads to a cash ratio of more than 3 times. The business also seems to have very low leverage with a D/E ratio of 1.35. Due to worsened profitability, Return on Assets, Return on Equity and Interest Coverage had worsened from FY17 to FY18.Cashflow StatementsDespite reductions in profit, operating cashflows had improved due to stronger working capital conditions. However, in FY18, Sembcorp had made substantial acquisitions of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures which led to a 12X increase in cashflow from investing activities. Additionally, capital expenditures of PPE increased by 1.5X as well. Cashflow from financing activities was also negative due to redemption of perpetual securities and payment for non-controlling interest acquired in FY17.Growth OpportunitiesUtilities Performance in IndiaIndia remains a key growth driver, accounting for 15-20% of earnings of Sembcorp. Utilities earnings achieved grew 23% YOY from improvement in India operations. This expected to continue into 2019 along with the resumption of a plant which had 50% capacity due to technical issues. The power market there is also recovering which can increase tariffs.Marine Sector ImprovementThe marine subsidiary had attained a surprising net profit in 4Q18, which led to the overall net profit for FY18 being better than expected. With improvement capex, this has led to more contract enquiries which may lead to improving financials, although the gestation period for this might be long.RisksCompetitive Power MarketThe opening up of the electricity market had led to a much more competitive environment. The carbon tax could also result in a cost of $15-20m which might be passed on to customers. Profits for this segment had fallen quite a fair bit compared to before in 2013.

This venture might be more risky, since India is still a relatively new market and strategies applied in Singapore can't be replicated wholesale there.1 comment7"
