1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Aug 2019If you are maxing out OCBC Titanium, consider Citi Rewards, UOB Lady and DBS WMMC in that order. Citi Rewards covers quite a huge range of shopping merchants.At this point in time, I feel your situation will be more like which bank is better. Citi has more advantages, especially when it comes to other categories, like dining.I won't say there is a single best card for shopping but adding a few more to your wallet would be the ideal to maximise your rewards. 0 comments0"
