Let me know and I can advise what checks u can consider. If certain conditions are satisfed, u can utlise your hospitalisation insurance for it. 1 comment0"

BAN KOK CLINIC at Potong Pasir.But it's always really packed and this guy is retiring soon... So you should call before going down.He charges flat rate of $100 or $110 and it is pretty comprehensive from PATHLAB.I've been going to him for the past 5 years.0 comments0"

With your budget, you can add on alot of tests. No specific hospital to recommend as I dont think there is best hospital screening.0 comments0"
