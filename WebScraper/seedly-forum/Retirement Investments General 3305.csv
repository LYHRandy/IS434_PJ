7,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Sep 2018First of all , I'm very sorry to hear that. I hope everythings getting better now. ​On the other hand , the years of working hard had finally paid off. In the sense of ready to retire, means family taken care of , have enough $ to be self sufficient.  So my thought is that , even though there's illnesses, try as much as possible to manage.  Should have sufficient insurance to cover.​ Meanwhile :(1) Enjoy the best time with family and kids (if applicable) , go for holidays together if able to go away at least 1 or 2 weeks without treatment. (2) something not so nice but it's necessary and responsblenfor everyone, get a will done, so that family(if any)  is taken care off. (3) if there's any treatment manageable physically and financially, go for it. The best gift anyone can give to you families or love one will always be your presence and time. So we do our best to survive and be around for them. ​Finally, I would like to say, nothing is 100% certain in this world. Miracles can happen for anyone. With treatment, there might be many years to come. There's many cancer patients recovered and live a good life still shows that ALL things are possible! If you do not give up hope ! ​All the best ! ​​0 comments0"
