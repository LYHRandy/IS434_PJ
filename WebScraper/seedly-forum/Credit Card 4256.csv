Youtrip has been hot on the radar for a while now and I actually got my own card too, but not enough experience making overseas payments with it to share if it's really worth it or not. Other than the inability to withdraw your balance (unless you give 30 days notice?), reviews seem good so far so you might wanna check it out :)0 comments0"
