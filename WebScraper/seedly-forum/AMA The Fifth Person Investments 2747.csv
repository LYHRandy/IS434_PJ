1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Feb 2019Hello!This year's budget like every other year spends the most on defence so you can look towards the side of ST engineering as mentioned by the others. Also, there seems to be an increase in spending on ageing Singaporeans. Thus, can look towards the healthcare sector such as Raffles Medical Group and Thompson Medical Group. Pharmetical industries can also be another area of healthcare to look into. There are some areas that maybe affected with policies such as Duty Free International Ltd since the government is reducint duty free alcohol allowance as well as the decrease in GST relief for goods bought overseas. 0 comments3"
2,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 20 Feb 2019SG's main spending- our defence budget has risen to 30%. I would say look towards ST Electronics(parent company of ST Kinetics-which makes weapons for SAF)Merdeka Generation Package- albeit a policy largely similar to Pioneer Generation Package and some would say a pre-election bolster. I would say look at sectors that are to benefit from the increasing ageing population care and service- hospitals, pharmacuticals, physiology. Indirectly related is the call for healthier foods-one which I believe will benefit local food wholesalers whom are particularly most adapted to capitalizing on this trend.0 comments2"
