question,"Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Feb 2019Does it make sense to redeem SSB with lower step up interest 1.4x - 2.0x for 1st 3 - 4 yrs but with attractive step up in last few yrs arises to eg. 2.11 % & 2.31% (Mar Apr 18 tranche) average interest? Thereafter, deploy to other high interest saving bank, etc Citi Maxigain which has good interest rate under current rising sibor environment? The key is future interest rate  will be unknown.  I don't want to end up trying to win big in the beginning & lose out more eventually.1 answerAnswerBump0"

MasterAnswered on 19 Feb 2019Citi maxigain did reduced from 80% of SIBOR to 70% of SIBOR because interest rate is rising. So they would probably do similar things if interest rate continues to go up and would not be a huge different. Personally if i have at least 70k, i would go for maxigain because they are compound interest unlike SSBs which are simple interest. You have to make your own decision. 0 comments0"
