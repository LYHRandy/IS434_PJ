ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I do understand how hard it is to convince your siblings to start planning their finances when you see them still spending most of their money. Maybe you can try to slowly tell them the benefits of planning early especially the power of compounding. The earlier we start to save and invest, the better it'll be for our future. Another thing you can do is recommend them some books to read which will inspire them. Some good book are rich dad poor dad and the richest man in Babylon. These 2 books illustrate financial planning with thought provoking examples and stories. 1 comment1"
