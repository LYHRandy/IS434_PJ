1,"Caelyn LimLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I saw that news too. If I'm not wrong, there is a pay scheme for teachers depending on their roles and years of experience. That particular teacher has been in the service for 16 years. I feel that amount for 16 years in civil service is not as much as 16 years in a private sector. 1 comment1"
