1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Mar 2019Hi there! Watches are a good investment but like investing in alternative investments such as cars, wine, art or any other tangible asset, it takes real expertise to make a profit. The secret to successful investment in watches is knowing which watches can be acquired below the retail prices, increasing their capital gains from reselling the watch. One advantage of investing in watches is their low correlation to other financial markets, such as stocks and bonds. A stock market crash would not directly impact the value of your watch and their value will hold. In investing in watches you would want to consider several aspects that play an important role. This includes brand recognition, heritage, exclusivity, availability and most importantly the appreciation of the watch's value over time. While Rolex is one of the brands highly demanded,  has a wonderful heritage and high level of recognition, it is widely available. Comparably, Patek Philippe is more or less similar to Rolex except for its accessibility due to their higher price tags compared to Rolexes. Other brands with a high demand include breitling, Omega, Audemars Piguet, Cartier, Panerai, Jaeger-LeCoultre and IWC. Apart from the brand, watches that tend to appreciate over time are the all-time classic (or also known as ""iconic"" watches).0 comments2"
