1,"Eveline LauLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I’ve not reach that stage of life but from a practical point of view, the following classes would be useful. But the key thing is to actually excel at one of them.Sports - swimming / tennis / badmintonThese sports can be done individually and when you excel at it, it’s a golden ticket to any school of your choice via DSA as they’re always in demand, especially the top schools.MusicPiano is only useful if you are good enough to win something at at least national level because not many schools have piano ensemble and many people can play the piano. Similarly for violin. In this aspect, brass and woodwind instrument are better. Nonetheless, I’ve heard that learning music trains the brain so you might want to consider sending your kid for it anyway.DanceBallet and contemporary dance are common for DSA. Know “interesting” forms of dance like hip hop are not considered as “know how to dance” in the eyes of the schools.CodingDigital World is the way forward, enough said.Personal opinion is to start as early as you can, as kids absorb knowledge and skills really fast and he/she resists one particular class, there‘s still time to try out other classes till you find one that he/she enjoys. Also, CCAs start as young as P3; if your kid has several years of experience prior to that, the chance of entering the school team is much higher. I was scouted into the school team before CCAs was made available for my year because of my experience. Being in the school team and winning medals look fancier as track records!3 comments2"

5,"Lee JiahuiLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 04 Dec 2018I pay for piano ($50/session), painting ($40/session), french (~$40/session), started at age 6 (yr turning 7) or primary 1. Before that was at mindchamps childcare, so was spending 1.6k/month and I deferred all other activities. So when we started classes, she had already waited for 2 to 4 years for the classes and she was also learning about delay gratification. She also chose the classes and teachers herself and I limited to just 3 classes. With her ownership in the decision, it's also easier for me to ensure that she remains interested in the classes.0 comments0"
