question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked 6d agoHi! I am almost 2 months into my first job but I do not enjoy my role although it is related to my degree. Looking to jump into another industry but should I put my current employment in my resume?I will be honest with my employment history during the interview just afraid it would hinder interview opportunities. At first, I was worried about not finding a job thus I settled for this role. However, I don't see myself working for long in the company so I figured it would be better for me to find something that I'm truly interested in now, instead of spending another 1 to 2 years learning something that would not value add my future employment. Hope to have some career advice, thank you!3 answersAnswerBump1"

At the same time... Reflect on what made you take this job and how you can increase the chance of a better fit for you going forward. Speak to people in the areas you will like to be in,  then look for the openings to make a pitch. Get clear about what you want before making a change, at where you are now or on where you will head to next. No point jobhopping then repeating the cycle.1 comment5"

3,"Leslie Koh, Associate Financial Services Manager at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 3d agoFigure out why you don’t enjoy your role. 
List out all the problems you face. Is it a “company” problem or is it a “you” problem?In every job, you will definitely learn something, if you know why you’re there. If you don’t like where you are, no matter how big the opportunity is, you wouldn’t see it. My advice is, sit down and think. What truly makes you happy at the end of the day and if your current job makes you happy. I’ve seen so many people earning good money but not happy at the end of the day. Eventually become jaded and then do mid career switch to pursue other things. Instead of worrying your resume, think for yourself. What do you really want. Then go ahead and pursue it!0 comments1"
4,"Guo Hao Teo, Self-Taught Enthusiast at Personal FinanceLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 4d agoHello there! You should consider why you are not enjoying your role.Usually based on my younger juniors at work i see that in the probation months it is usually a period where you are trying to figure out learning at the start.You may be uncomfortable but that is where you are learning the most.Find mentors and seniors who can help guide you before really quitting to find a new place.If you have less than 3 months at a certain job role, it is not enough time to fully appreciate the scope of it. Hope this helps. :)Hope others can help chime in also!0 comments1"
