GeniusAnswered on 30 May 2019I agree with being debt free first (personal, credit card loan that are charging exorbitant fees). I would do up my insurance and savings concurrently. The first thing you should do up is your integrated shield plan which cover for hospital expenses. Next step would be to purchase a life or term policy to cover loss of income due to death or sickness. If you are someone who just started work, get a small policy and make monthly payment instead. Make sure it is comfortable and basically you took the first step in your own financial planning journey.0 comments0"
