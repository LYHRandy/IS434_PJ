God of WisdomAnswered on 18 Mar 2019Yes, but preferably not all.There are pros and cons to a group term policy. You can read up about that yourself.However the 2 things I want to point out are:1) The CI Benefit of the plan increases with age. It's not constant. 2) The Early CI benefit only covers 10 conditions unlike the 100+ over by private insurers.I suggest to cover her death coverage using the MINDEF Term but a private plan for income protection needs due to Illness.0 comments0"
