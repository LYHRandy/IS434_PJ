3,"Cherie Julianne TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 May 2018Ask them to PayPal. (haha *crickets)You can try hinting to them subtly, or ask them nicely, sometimes people genuinely forgot about it.Or you can find a way to get them to buy something for you then bring it up when you are about to pay them back. Then pay them back the difference if your item is more expensive then what they owe you. Unless the amount is pretty big then it is a bit tough heh.0 comments3"

5,Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Depending what kind of person they are. There are some who'd respond with a quick reminder but there are some who'd blatantly disregard you. For the latter I would go shopping with them and make sure I'm at the cashier wit them before pulling the stunt of I-forgot-my-wallet-help-me-pay-first-since-you-owe-me-$xxxxx. Make sure your purchase comes with a salesman standing by your side to witness the whole process to embarrass them if necessary.. and your purchase comes with a 7 days no questions asked refund.3 comments2

7,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 24 May 2018Would recommend you to find the pal or relative's close family member to ask for a chaser? :)â€‹I think it's usually quite tricky as this is based on trust, but do offer a healthy and helping hand to figure it out together. Maybe he/she really has some financial difficulties that they are going through.â€‹But above all, do know that lending to close friends and family members may always have a high default rate (ie not paying back). so yeah!0 comments2"
8,"Pascal SamsoonLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 24 May 2018I have heard this scenario many times, and fortunately, we now have GrabPay...Open Grab App, go to GrabPay and Request...send the request via your preferred messaging app accompanied by a message to explain what the request for money is about... â€‹It works for most cases...â€‹Hope it helps,Pascal0 comments1"
9,"Jessie YapLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 25 May 2018Pretend that you are in debt and desperately need the moneyâ€‹Alternatively, I believe dbs paylah has the option for you to request money, don't forget to add in the message ""O$P$"" 0 comments0"
10,"Kenichi XiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 25 May 2018It might not sound right but the best way is to get their family members to know about the situation and try to work out a payment package.â€‹The above does not guarantee a pay back but more on knowing the chances of getting it back. eg. if the family, cant be bother, case is actually closed.giving the family a chance to help him change this bad habit whatever the source of reason. eg. maybe a night club gf?getting some money back when the family are willing to help.â€‹#justsharingwhatithink0 comments0"
