If so, you don't have to set up a company just to buy shares. You can set up an account under any local brokerages and start trading :)If you mean buy shares from your own company... Technically when you set up your own company you own 100% of your company (assuming no other investors and you use 100% your own money), so you own 100% of your own company's shares.0 comments0"
