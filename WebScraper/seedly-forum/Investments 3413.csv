1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Sep 2018F. Just continue selling puts as usual but reduced exposure and amount at risk. If things get caught out, well I've got a discount on a great stock. Where then I can decide to hold it and wait for recovery or do some magic with it and earn along the way 0 comments0"

5,"Luke Ho, Venture Capitalist at CFXLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 14 Sep 2018I recently made a video about this. You can view it at​https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/, it only takes a minute. ​But honestly, I wouldn't take too many defensive actions unless you have a clear understanding of what kind of crash it is and how to prevent it (like the Big Short of 2008). That way even if you have to wait out a few years of good returns before preventing your market crash, you stiil come out on top.​Ultimately, time in the market is better than timing the market. ​​0 comments0"
