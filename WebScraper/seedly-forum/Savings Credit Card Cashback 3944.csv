Grand MasterAnswered 4w ago3% for almost everything that is contactless transactions, that's the best deal so far.You still can get OCBC Plus debit card with 4% or 7% at NTUC supermarket or Esso or SCB Xtrasaver with 7% for petrol, or POSB Passion card for 4-5% rebate for cold storage, giant, guardian etc.Other these niches, probably no other debit card better than the DBS Visa Debit for now.0 comments1"
