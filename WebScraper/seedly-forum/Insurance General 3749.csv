question,Insurance General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 07 Jul 2019What happens when someone takes a life Insurance policy when he donâ€™t smoke but later he starts? Will the policy cover the person if something happens due to smoking?I'm checking for a friend.

God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Jul 2019There is usually a period of two years (please check individual policy wording), after which the policy becomes incontestable.
