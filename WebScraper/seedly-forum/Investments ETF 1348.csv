1,"SKShabir Khan, Graduate Of Aviation Management & Services at Temasek PolytechnicLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 12 May 2019Hi,Since VUSD is domiciled in Ireland, the withholding tax is reduced to 15% compared to investing in a U.S ETF which has a 30% withholding tax. The 15% is on the dividends that your receive, as for expense ratio it is 0.07% of your capital invested. As for the returns there is no definitive figure that can be provided as it is based on the market. If you invest in SGD you may either gain or lose based the forex rate.0 comments1"

3,"Question Poster12 May 2019Thanks for answering the question! The withholding tax is for dividends only? Does capital gain gets tax under the withholding tax?Lok Yang Teng12 May 2019Thereâ€™s no capital gain tax, just the withholdig tax on dividends. Hence, its advisable to go for growth stocks rather than high dividend yield stocks."
