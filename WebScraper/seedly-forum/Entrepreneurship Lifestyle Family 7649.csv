WizardUpdated on 24 Sep 2019Not super popular, but Die Empty by Todd Henry.The book stems from his first book, the Accidental Creative, where a friend asked this question: ""What do you think is the most valuable land in the world?""Several people threw out guesses, such as Manhattan, the oil fields of the Middle East, and the gold mines of South Africa, before his friend indicated that they were way off track. He paused for a moment, and said, ""You're all wrong. The most valuable land in the world is the graveyard. In the graveyard are buried all of the unwritten novels, never-launched businesses, unreconciled relationships, and all of the other things that people thought, 'I'll get around to that tomorrow.' One day, however, their tomorrows ran out."" No one charts a course for mediocrity, yet it is still a destination of choice.and of course, the most shared quote:“The cost of inaction is vast. Don't go to your grave with your best work inside you. Choose to die empty.” https://www.amazon.com/Die-Empty-Unleash-Your-Every-ebook/dp/B00AEBEWMC0 comments5"
