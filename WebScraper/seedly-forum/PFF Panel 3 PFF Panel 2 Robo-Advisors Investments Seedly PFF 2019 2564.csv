1,"Png Cheng Xi Damien, Happy Life Seeker at HomeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Jun 2019Which level of education are you refering to? For university, you'll have around 18 years to accumulate. While many of those here are against this, I think that an endowment plan would actually suit you. Those longer than 15 years usually gives yield of around 3% p.a. compounded.Everything else has to depend on your risk appetite as those are investments.0 comments0"
