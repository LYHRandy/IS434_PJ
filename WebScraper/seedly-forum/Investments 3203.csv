1,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Oct 2018Dollardex offers only unit trusts whereas POSB offers equities and bonds etf. For Dollardex, customers can enjoy zero sales charge, platform fees and switching fees but they need to pay management fees. For POSB, customers have to pay management fees and commissions. 0 comments0"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Aug 2018Different instruments offered. Dollardex offers only mutual funds / unit trusts if memory serves me right. Whereas posb offers either the STI ETF or a bond fund. There's still management fees to be paid for both platforms, but posb's should be significantly lower. 0 comments0"
