1,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Jan 2019It's very reckless to cancel something based on reading off a bunch of threads. Accurately, Pulsar typically doesn't have an insurance element. There still has to be a lot more specifics like how long the plan has been going on - and you have to remember that high fees are offset by the starting bonus. Something that has that much of a headstart and compounding exponentially can easily offset high fees. Easily. And you can only determine exponential compounding by going over the asset allocation. Which you should do. Justify the cancellation on a wide range of information, not limited ones. Aside from that, if you're going to tell someone to cancel a plan and lose their money, TAKE responsibility for it. They have to be actively doing something to make that the money and show them projections for reassurance, at the very least. 0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 01 Jan 2019I think it really depends on the Pulsar Policy etc. We are looking and moving forward instead of lamenting on what's done. We will need to evaluate the fees involved. If its just starting (which should be from the surrender value), need to evaluate whether does it make sense to continue or surrender. No straight answer, it depends.0 comments1"
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 31 Dec 2018Pulsar doesnt have much of an insurance unless u choose the enhanced death benefit.But to me the cost structure is too high. ( Account Maintenance Fee , Investment Management Fee, Administrative Fee, Policy Maintenance Fee ) There are way lower cost platforms in the market.0 comments1"
4,"Alan KorLevel 5. GeniusUpdated on 07 Jun 2019yes you are right, never mix insurance with investment.the only pple who advocates mixing insurance with investment are the pple who are selling the plans and profitting heavily from the huge commissions.pulsar is a rubbish plan, better surrender before more losses are incurred.likewise, when agents tell you that they ""managed to get double digit returns on my client's pulsar policies over the last 2 years even after after the recent sell off"", take it with a pinch of salt lol1 comment0"
5,"Loh Tat Tian02 Jan 2019Your comments hold water now. It's a case by case basis. Not sure if you know that 20 years ago, there are really not a lot of information and ILPs and unit trust / mutual funds are considered the more readily available avenue. "

God of WisdomAnswered on 31 Dec 2018If your reason is because investment shouldn't mix with insurance, then it's bad advice.Pulsar almost no insurance.It's an investment plan that allows you to invest in UTs usually not available to retail clients. Instead, you should have looked at the portfolio allocation. I've managed to get double digit returns on my client's pulsar policies over the last 2 years even after after the recent sell off.0 comments0"
