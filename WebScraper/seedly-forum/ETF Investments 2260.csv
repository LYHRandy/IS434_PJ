1,"Kishor BhagwatLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 13 Mar 2019If you already have the lump sum with you, its better to go one shot than do DCA. If you dont have the lump sum then buy whenever you can accumulate enough to justify your transaction costs. DCA is simply a way for people with less control/discipline or no lumpsum to invest without thinking much about. Take a look at the ETF price history and valuation to decide if the ETF is overpriced currently. If it is overpriced/overvalued, both lumpsum and DCA dont make sense...why buy something when its expensive?0 comments0"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hello!I would personally invest in small amounts consistently as it is a form of Dollar Cost Averaging as mentioned by Sandra. It would help to reduce the possibility of buying at the highest price. This also means that you will be buying the ETF at an average price. Buying a lump-sum amount would have a higher risk of buying the ETFs at a higher price as compared to buying it consistently, thus i personally would choose to buy it consistently as compared to lump sum.0 comments0"
3,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hi there! Investing in small amounts consistently also known as dollar cost averaging gradually builds your exposure to the ETF and reduces the risk of entering the market at an unfavourable time. In the long run, you will be buying more units of the ETF at market lows and less at market highs. DCA gives you the benefit of diversified risk. If the ETF price is not volatile, DCA returns would be worst than lump sum investing.0 comments0"
