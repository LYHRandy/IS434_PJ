1,"SKShabir KhanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 18 Mar 2019CDP is preferred by most due to the fact that the Shares are under your name and you are the legal owner. You also get invites to AGM, Rights Issues etc, also if your brokerage closes down, your shares wouldnâ€™t be affected. But it does come at a higher cost to purchase shares that directly go to your CDP.As for Custodian, the shares at legally under your brokerage name, so you would only get invites to AGM, Rights Issues if your brokerage decides to send you them. Although most do not bother to send the invites. If the Brokerage closed down, your shares would be affected and it would take you some time to get back your shares. But it is cheaper to buy shares that go to a custodian.0 comments1"
