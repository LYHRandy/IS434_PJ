God of WisdomAnswered on 26 Aug 2019It's pretty decent for overseas spend, at least till the end of the promotion period.After which, I would revert to BOC Elite Miles card if I am able to generate sufficient spending to redeem my miles regularly. If not, you can consider holding on if you would prefer to earn miles that do not expire.For local spending, on par with other entry levels $30K cards (CitiPM, DBS Altitude), but no lounge access. On the other hand, 1000 miles transfer blocks and no transfer fee will make this a good card to top up your miles balance in small increments.0 comments3"
