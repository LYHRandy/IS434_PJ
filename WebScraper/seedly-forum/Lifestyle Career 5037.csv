Watch or listen to the news! (Or read about it) and be diligent in finding out about the things you don't understand.I learnt that every time you have spare time, it's a choice between education and amusement. When we spend so much time on amusement (eg. dramas and games), it doesn't add value to us. Not that you shouldn't do it, but you should limit the time on that, and spend some time on education instead!0 comments1"

Then you will know who is the dumbest among those who speak.Empty vessels make the most noise. Keep silent and plot your strategy. The more they talk, the more they reveal their weakness0 comments1"

4,"Luke Ho, Money Maverick at Money MaverickLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 06 Dec 2018Typically you can start by researching information most aligned with your values. I think the reason they talk about these affairs is because they obviously feel some sort of personal alignment to them. Kick back and listen and figure out their motivations, before you  can figure out yours and do reading into what you're interested in. There are many hard questions and ugly truths that can be revealed by economics and politics, and they're necessary for you to keep pushing forward in a largely unfair world, so start from things you feel strongly about so that you learn more aboout yourself as well. 0 comments0"
