A ballpark would be 5 to 7k. The purchase will have to be done in full cash so my clients who buy in trust prefer to buy BUC new launch so that they don't have to pay cash upfront for the entire purchase but in stages until the project is completed.​​​

But u will also (most likely) have to purchase the property in full cash. Banks will not (mostly) do not loan to trust purchases especially the beneficiary is a minor. Depending on the age of your child, also there are other drawbacks.0 comments0"
