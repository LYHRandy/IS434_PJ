Give you 4 miles per dollar in the form of DBS points when making online purchases.Note that points expire in 1 year so remember to transfer them out when you are nearing the 1 year mark.Another card would be UOB Preferred Platinum Visa.Same thing as above, 4mpd for online transactions.Cheers2 comments0"
