question,"Bank Account Credit Card DBS Asked by Raymond KohAsked on 30 Jul 2019Where should I seek help if I have unexplained transactions on my credit card?My dad has a $14.09 item that is being charged every month which is not accounted for. Called the DBS hotline and they said they are unable to check. He got the same response even when he turned up in person at the bank, saying that he should call the hotline. There is a line on the statement that states that the cardholder should highlight discrepancies 7 days from receiving the credit card statement. What can he do?2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Joyce Chan, Senior Financial Consultant at Prudential Assurance Company SingaporeLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 30 Jul 2019Just call the bank and they will initiate an investigation. It has happened to my Standard Chartered and OCBC credit cards before. The anti-fraud teams in the banks have been super quick to respond and have refunded me the unexplained transactions within a month of reporting them.
Hope this helps!0 comments4"

Alternatively, check what is being recorded down on the statement. All statement will list down what merchant is charging what amount line by line.Lastly, cancel the card.

3,"Raymond Koh02 Aug 2019Thanks for your response! However, we do not recognize the line item on the credit card statement. Furthermore, it is charged on different days each month. For e.g. ""IQBrainBooster - $14.09"" (we definitely have no such purchase). Anyway, my dad went down to the bank and they stated that they will only investigate for this month's and last month's transactions. They will not be able to investigate earlier than that.Aik Kai03 Aug 2019Ah jeez. I would cancel the card and get a new one. I mean, this is stupid to be paying for something I don't even know what the heck is that.

Or, maybe your dad don't remember charging his card for it? Either way, just cancel the card as it might have been compromised."
