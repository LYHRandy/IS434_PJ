God of WisdomAnswered on 19 Mar 2019You may want to reconsider the STI investment.You'll want to build a globally diversified portfolio and understand your risk profile or your desired asset allocation.You can do so through an FA like myself or Robo FA like EndowUs or FSM Maps, using low cost actively managed funds or passively through ETFs either DIY or through a Robo fund manager like Stashaway or Autowealth.0 comments1"
2,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Mar 2019Learn about yourself first, how you handle money and investments. That will help determine your risk profile as well. Whether you can take a big drop in the market and still sleep at night. If you can't, you may want to read into something called an all weather portfolio. Comprising mainly of a global Etf, a local stock Etf and a bond fund or Etf. It'll help weather bear markets, as its name suggests. But in good times growth may be capped.Personally I can stomach some risk so I prefer to operate an options portfolio instead. Flexible in nature, and can still make good returns in any market condition. And I don't mean uninspiring single digit returns. Mid double digits and above is where I want my portfolio to grow on an annual basis, compounded.0 comments1"

You can use robo advisors or buy ETFs yourself through a broker. You can buy US etfs or ireland domiciled etf from london stock exchange.0 comments1"
