God of WisdomAnswered on 15 May 2019REITs as an investment tool are great for aggressive and moderately aggressive portfolios, and you can hold probably 30% of your portfolio in them. But when you're closer to retirement age, I wouldn't hold too many REITs. Probably only 10% of my portfolio.I liken REITs to High Yield Bond funds. They hold similar benefits to investors and are exposed to similar risks especially interest rates. Market conditions that REITs thrive in are low interest rate environments as they use quite a lot of gearing and are leveraged.0 comments2"

As what I've shared in other posts, I first started out with REITs 7 years ago when I was 18 and since I didn't require the money, I just parked it there collecting dividends. One don't usually dabble in REITs for capital appreciation hence I'd take it as an investment tool rather stocks (which is more suited to shorter term trading). As what Hariz has pointed out, a low interest rate market would benefit REIT as they borrow close to 40% loans to fund their business. Therefore a higher interest rate would erode shareholder returns.0 comments0"

Building your investment portfolio is like gardening. You build it one step at a time. Some stocks, some retis, some funds, some bonds. Add into your collections and build your passive income along the way. I understand that you're new to investment, that means before you purchase something, do read up about it. I made mistakes such as investing based on hearsay previously and I paid for the mistake. Don't commit the same mistake. There are a few factors concerning about REITS that you should understand. Occupancy, Gearing, Leasehold and interest rate. And also in this current environment, if interest rate is going to rise, REITS with high gearing would be affected and it would be good to look into it to see how the management deals with it. This is an interesting topic and I would say it would take a deeper discussion to understand it better. Of course, if you're keen to talk more about it, message me back. Glad to help.0 comments0"

Combining good quality REITs ( the 4 Mapletrees, parkway and Ascendas) with the local banks and STI index ETF would give you an excellent start. If banks are to expensive, Sti index ETF is good enough.  Invest equally with no single counter making up more than 5% of ur total portfolio unless its an ETF. There is no right or wrong weightage, u just have to jump in and learn along the way.0 comments0"
