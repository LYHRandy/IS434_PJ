question,"DBS Live Fresh Card Citibank SMRT EZ-LINK Card Bank Account Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 03 Nov 2018Citibank SMRT Card vs DBS Visa vs DBS Live Fresh?My credit card spend is about $300-400 per month($50 ezlink, $75 phone bill, $200 food/movies/grab, $30 NTUC). I'm currently on DBS Multiplier, using DBS Live Fresh as my cc. However, I feel that I'm always unable to meet the min spending of $600 to get rebates and am thinking of getting a citibank SMRT card, + spend $1 on live fresh or use it for bigger purchases e.g. booking air tix to collect interest. Any advice?1 answerAnswerBump0"
