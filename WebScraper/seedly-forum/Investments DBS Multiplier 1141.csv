God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey Anon, you have a rather imbalanced and heavily concentrated portfolio as of now.You should at max keep either 6 months of your income as cash or 5% of your entire portfolio whichever higher.For your equity holding, you should be more diversified across multiple stocks in different industries and geographies. I'd probably limit any one stock to about 5% of my portfolio as well. In terms of your total equity holding, you can probably hold 65% in total.You're definitely missing other negatively correlated or uncorrelated assets to your portfolio such as property and bonds. This should make up the remaining 30% of your portfolio.There's definitely quite a lot of things you'll need to consider and take action on to have a globally diversified and balanced portfolio. These numerical guidelines will of course change based on your immediate goals, requirement to take risk, ability to take risk, and changing investment horizon.Shorter term goals should be invested with less risk and volatility and as you age, you should be more conservative to preserve your assets.5 comments3"
