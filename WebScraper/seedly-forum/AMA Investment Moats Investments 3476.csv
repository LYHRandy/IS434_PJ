1,"Ng Lip Hong KyithLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018i came from a unit trust environment. Back then I learn about portfolio allocation, how to manage a unit trust portfolio. ​Then I start to learn about individual stock investing. I have been going to the library consistently to pick up IT books that I need, so its natural to add a finance or investing book to it. ​My first stock is Food Junction. I think the earnings was pretty good, the balance sheet was pretty clean and it gives a 6% dividend yield back in 2005. They went into China to expand. ​Food business overseas is tough. They just screw it up. They are not the only one. Thats my first stock story. Didn't end up well.0 comments0"
