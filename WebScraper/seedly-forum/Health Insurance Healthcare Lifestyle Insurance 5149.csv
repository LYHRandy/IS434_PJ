1,"Soon XiaohuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 29 Jun 2018Hello, may I know if your mom been rejected or declined for any insurance application? If the answer is no, you may apply for Moratorium Underwriting under Aviva.​And also do rememeber to check if her medishield life covers on her diabetes condition too as medishield life does exclude certain condition(s) for people who has pre-existing conditions if it is severe. This is something which many is not aware of. ​Alternatively, you may also look into getting insurance such as AIA Diabete Care (T&C - diabete must only diagnosed after age 25) , NTUC Silver Secure to assist in reducing the medical treatment/bills. ​Do drop me an email at kate.soon@proinvest.com.sg if you need explaination on the plans, what you can do, etc. 0 comments2"

At 55 with such conditions, it is most likely the no insurers would be willing to underwrite this policy under Integrated Shield Plan. However, you can still go ahead and try and see if the underwriters are willing to incept this case. ​0 comments1"

WizardAnswered on 29 Jun 2018I tried applying for my future father in law who is around 70 years old... and unfortunately my agent who asked us to fill up the medical questionaire told us it was extremely unlikely for the insurer to want to take on this risk. And alas, it was true, they did not insure him.​Instead what I would suggest you to do is to be familiar with all the Integrated shield plans and also hypothetically come up with a scenario with how much a worst case scenario would cost (assuming you want a private level of treatment). From there, you would be able to save up that $X amount in a high yield and liquid savings account as your rainy day 'if-mom-falls-ill' funds.. :) My future father in law has now stashed some funds away for this purpose.​And of course, maybe educate her and also let her know that it would be extremely expensive if she had to go for treatements etc, so better to take care of her health! 0 comments0"
