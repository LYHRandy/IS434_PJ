ProdigyUpdated on 04 Jan 2019Get the degree. usually the returns from better job, assuming a $500 monthly increase (can be more) that is 6,000 a year. is much more than the interests from the debt.The other important thing is do it while you are young. More energy, less commitments. My friends and I are at the stage where we don't have much time anymore. Haha. 35+ yrs in case you are wondering.edited: I do think there i benefit in working for 1-2 years so that you can see the real world and how degree can benefit you in your area of work as well as helps you to appreciate the knowledge imparted during your degree course more.

MasterAnswered on 03 Jan 2019A degree is important in the work force, unless you are comfortable to have lower chance of promotion (especially GLC etc semi government companies).In short, as long as you are able to get an entry and higher pay based on the degree, please get the degree. 0 comments0"
