1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 23 Mar 2019There cannot be 'one metric to rule them all' because:Everyone has different investing methodologies. A value investor would look at a company differently as compared to a growth investor, or something investing purely for dividends. Different industry sectors have different metrics that matter. For example, there was once a period when more exotic metrics like 'eyeballs' and 'impressions' were in fashion for the social media industry. Compare this to a pharmaceutical chain across China, where you should be look at revenue and margin per store, revenues by geography, cash conversion and inventory turns etc.0 comments2"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Hello!There is no most important metric as one metric alone would not be able to give you a comprehensive coverage of a company's financial health. Instead of looking for the most important metric, maybe you can look at a various number of metrics that can give you information about a company's financial health when evaluating a company. Here are some of such metrics P/E ratio, which is able to tell you how much of a premium investors are willing to pay for a company's earnings. PEG ratio, price to earnings ratio which can be used to determine a stock's value while taking into account the company's expected earnings growth. Debt to equity ratio, which reflects the ability of shareholder equity to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn. BETA, a measurement of how reactive a stock is as compared to the overall market.Hope this helps!0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 21 Mar 2019I think there are alot of metrics that people often look at like ratios and financials.For me, im a macro outlook investor, i focus on market opportunity.If a lousy company meets an amazing market opportunity, market always wins.If an amazing company like good management etc meets a weak market opportunity, market will win.For example, the telco business looks like a race to the ground. Market always wins. > stay away from telco companies.0 comments1"
