2) If you replace the policy, could you get the same coverage
3) Would you be in a better position (in terms finance) if you surrender compared to the amount already paid? 
4) Are you able to service it? 
5) If there is no need, could you see it as an additional annuity that will serve you after 65?
6) Are there any exclusions, which may affect you getting a other policy?Surrendering a policy is no small matter. You really need to see why or why not you should continue with the policy.0 comments0"
