1,"Leonard TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Apr 2019A very sound question indeed!Sadly, a bull or bear market is most often highly sentimental. As you probably already heard, the global economy is at its late stage cycle nearing recession. Therefore   logically you would expect a more bearish outlook in a longer horizon. However there have been many positives of late: Progress in Trade War suspension and resolution, Positive US Job Employment Data just last Friday, Chinese PMI Manufacturing surprise(despite Trade War Disputes). All these positive indicators seem to suggest we might enjoy more bullish market in the short run- which is why the markets has been enjoying a run up recently from the lows in late 2018.0 comments1"
2,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 13 Apr 2019Hello! this is a good question as im sure that many people here are wondering the same thing too. What exaclty is a bull or bear market?Bull market - when markets are going up aggresively over a period of time. Bear market - the opposite of a bull market. It happens where the market is moving down about 20 percent quarter after quarter. A bull market usually takes place when there is a strong economy and there are high employment levels across the board. While a bear market usually takes place when there are signs of a decline. Share prices are constantly dropping and season investors believe that he trend is most likely to continue in the future.0 comments0
