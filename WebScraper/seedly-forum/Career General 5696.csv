question,Career General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Jul 2019Am I allowed to reject job offer after signing it? If you signed a job offer today and let's say 1 week later you get a much better offer. Can reject the signed one and take up the new one?3 answersAnswerBump0

However some job contracts may impose a penalty (most often financial) if you sign on the dotted line and eventually choose not to commence. Read the contract carefully before signing.2 comments3"

Tons of examples online (Google is our best friend). As mentioned by others, always check if there is penalty, or if the penalty is worth paying for the better job offer. All the best!0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 04 Jul 2019If you want to reject, other than checking on the contract whether there are any penalty clauses, please do the basic courtesy to pen a formal letter to the company inform them that you will not be starting work with them in advance.
The company will have sufficient notice to select another candidate for replacement or may even consider raising their offer to you.0 comments0"
