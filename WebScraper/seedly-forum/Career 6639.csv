MasterAnswered on 15 Oct 2018I have been in the education sector (Private school, tution centre, private tutoring) for some time before, and the main reason why I prefer schools rather than tutoring is really the timing. If you are prepared to sacrifice social life (not that we don't have free time, but we usually work when others are not, and are free at times where others are working), then I would say it's a rather great earner and all in all, a fun job as well (as long as the parent's are not the difficult to handle kind).To be objective, the pros are:Great moneyDon't have to wake up so earlyOnce you develop syllabus, the teaching part is relatively easyIf reputation develops, group tuition can earn you quite a bitSome people ask ""what about the flexibility? that's good right?"" but flexibility is really only for the student. If they can't make it, you are the one who has to arrange your whole schedule for a make up lesson. Same for when either party is sick. During holidays, they go overseas at different weeks, you want to go for holiday at different weeks too, then how do you re-arrange the schedule?Cons:Have to deal with parents (although some are really nice)Have to deal with students who can't be bothered (most tiring)The whole ""flexibility"" thing I talked aboutWeekends are usually packed with classes (because that's the prime time for tutors)If you do something wrong (even if it's not true) it affects your rep really fastAll in all, teach if you have passion for it, do tutoring if you don't mind the committing your life to growing young minds (who talk back). I loved my teaching days, but I have also seen my fair share of bad times!0 comments3"
