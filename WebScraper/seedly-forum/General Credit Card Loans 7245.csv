1,"Charmaine NgLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 May 2018Increase credit score by making prompt payment on time. If possible, reduce the # of debts that you have by paying off wherever possible - especially credit cards and loans.​Do not open multiple new accounts within short period of time in bid to increase your available funds or close accounts to make it go away. Credit score stays affected for a number of years - 3 years or 5 years for bankruptcy.​Most importantly, check your credit report. The whole purpose is that bank assess you as a responsible user of credit so if you uses the credit and are able to pay back responsibly - you will have a better credit in long term.0 comments2"
