3,"Yk LaiLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 16 Nov 2018When I started my career at the current company bringing 4 years of relevant working experience, I reached office before 7am and stayed at office till 7-8pm daily. My yearly increment was not compatible for the efforts and accomplishments as I later found out my pay was the same as a fresh graduate. But I wanted to show my commitment, I care about my job. Those long hours stay lasted for 4 about years, until my first son arrived to the world. I don't mind to do long hours as I love my job. But family comes first. Now, I am near to 8 years in the company. I go home on time every day unless there is excursion. Instead of emphasizing what made me stayed late, I wanted to emphasize what makes me leave on time. I love my family.0 comments3"
4,"Loh Tat TianLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Nov 2018I try my best to leave on time for my job. Why?1) I had tried working for many hours till 10-11pm or even 12midnight to settle the issues, and wake up on time ot reach work at 9am. The belief that putting hardwork in was the main driver (since you are young, you can take more work, and the hope for better salary and appreciation).2) But too bad, life is unfair, and sometimes work just pile up, even if you have thought you tried your best. Things doesn't work out like a fairy tail. There will be disappointments, and massive disappointments. You may even question yourself on the endurance to do all the work that is on you.3) As yin and yang, you need a balance. So I am adopting the balance approach now. Work so that you doesn't let yourself down (since you are paid a salary anyway). But also to put in time for your family. You are dispensable to a company. But you are indispensable to your family.0 comments1"
