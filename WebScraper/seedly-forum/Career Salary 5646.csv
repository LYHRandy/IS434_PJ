1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 08 Sep 2019I would look at the job prospects and the team unless the lower pay job is paying significantly less.
Given that you are saving for the upcoming wedding and family expenses, you should probably be looking at a job that 1) Allows you to expand your scope and rise up the ranks 2) Reasonable pay increment as you contribute more value 3) Longevity. You don't want to find yourself unemployed in the midst of having a baby and servicing your mortgage.
Additionally, what is your future spouse's earning power, and how much flexibility does it give you in your job?0 comments2"

3,"Fergus TanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Sep 2019To be honest, I think salary is the least of your concerns unless it's at least a 30% differential.There are too many factors at play also. Do your family depend on you heavily to pay expenses? Do you have any cash savings buffer? Will the wedding result in kids coming soon?
Most people with high liabilities tend to take less risk with their career because they have bills to pay.
Late 20s is hard to tell and is definitely different for males and females. I would assume you are male and have been working for about 5 years.
From what I see, you are trending towards taking lesser risk, because you are looking more towards option 2. To be honest, there's no harm taking that, unless option 1 is paying 30% higher, or it is in a much bigger company.
When you are looking to do quick job changes, the name of the company, and the title of your job matters.
If you could give more details, it would be helpful too0 comments1"
