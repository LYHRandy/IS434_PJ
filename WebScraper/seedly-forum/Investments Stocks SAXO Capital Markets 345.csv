1,"Adam Wong, Editor-in-chief at The Fifth PersonLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated 4w agoYes. For U.S. stocks, Interactive Brokers charges USD1 per trade compared to USD4 for Saxo. IB is also cheaper for Hong Kong and Japan stocks, but charge the same for Australian stocks. You can compare their prices here:https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1590&p=stocks1https://www.home.saxo/en-sg/rates-and-conditions/equities-and-etfs/commissionsHowever, IB charges a USD10 monthly fee -- unless you make a minimum of 10 trades per month or have a USD100,000 minimum in your account.0 comments3"
2,"Cedric Jamie Soh, Director at Seniorcare.com.sgTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated 2w agoInteractive Broker is very cheap, with the lowest fee in the world (probably) and the widest range of products. They are known as mass-market stock brokers. If you are doing only $100 a month, it can still be cheaper in IB despite the $10 monthly fee by IB, if your stock is bought in overseas currency. This is because IB's forex rate is hugely with no hidden spreads in some banks and brokers. You're saving quite a big difference on the forex.Commission is lowest. (some products is negative commission, means you get paid to trade). Most of my commission is $1 or $2 for 100 stocks. And I get paid commission for trading in non popular stocks as I adding liquidity to them.Variety is the most wide in this broker.Forex rate is one of the most competitive (a lot of brokers have hidden fees due to the spread)They have a local Citibank account, so you can FAST transfer SGD, and the SGD reflected in your account within minutes. Then go platform and exchange to USD or whatever you want on your own.$10 minimum fee, so if you only trade $4 this monthy, they will charge extra $6 to round it up to $10.5 is a bad point, but 1-4 makes it worthwhile.0 comments0"
