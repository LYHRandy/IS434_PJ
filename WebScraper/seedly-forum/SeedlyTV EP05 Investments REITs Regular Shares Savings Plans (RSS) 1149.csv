1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Jun 2019I wouldn't touch a reit etf. Ask yourself why do you need to pay a management fee and receive a lower yield when you can just look at the etfs holdings and buy into those counters on your own?Unfortunately with the demise of maybank ke's MIP programme, there is no easy and cheap way to buy into the strong reits here. An alternative, which I'm personally considering is to use their prefunded account to buy into counters. You will need to top up the account before buying stocks but the commission rates are lower.0 comments0"

Or you have don’t have a lot of cash to buy a lot at a go as it would be adviceable to buy in $3k-4K worth at a go to make it worth for your transaction fee.Or you can go the more hardworking way of just selecting a REITs ETF you like then just copy and buy everything.0 comments0
