question,"Unit Trust Investments AMA The Fifth Person Asked by AnonymousAsked on 18 Feb 2019Why do people still invest in mutual funds even if there are so much academic research showing that they are not consistent in beating the market? Shouldn't we all just move into passive investing?I've recently been reading up on many articles and books on investing, such as ""a random walk down wall street"" by Burton G. Malkiel, and they have provided strong evidence that mutual fund performance is not consistent and is at best, on par with the market, discounting transaction fees and other hidden costs. So why are mutual funds even still existing in the first place? shouldn't they become obsolete since we are able to do so much better with a passive index fund strategy?2 answersAnswerBump0"

It is possible for mutual funds to beat the market but hard to find. Everyone can beat the market if they have the ability to do so like Warren Buffett. They still exist because there are people who are lazy to learn about investment but still want to invest so they pay people to do so. Some people are rich and can pay the fees and they dont mind at all.0 comments0"

Active funds can beat the market.Also, passive funds usually only track the index, and sometimes an index is not something you would want to invest in. There are plenty of duds in the S&P 500, not even mentioning in just the 30 companies of the Straits Times Index. Good active and hedge fund managers are rare, but they do exist. And they can consistently beat the index after fees year after year for 10 year periods. There are plenty that don't but that's investing isn't it. You need to learn how to pick fund managers and funds like you pick stocks. There are bad stocks and good ones. Like there are efficient indices and markets, and inefficient ones. I'd rather pay 2% for consistent double digit returns on a proven fund manager with strong fundamentals, than 0.1% for 7% return on a broad equity index. 0 comments0"
