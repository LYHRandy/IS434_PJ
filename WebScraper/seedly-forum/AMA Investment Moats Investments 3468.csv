1,"Ng Lip Hong KyithLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 21 Aug 2018Ah tough question. Usually i would advocate you see the magnitude of the fall. if the fall is 10% or 20% its not too bad, but if you think this has reached 50%, then may be you want to put both your contribution for the year in at once.​if you do not have the money, then the decision is obvious. there is nothing much you could do. ​if its a 10-20% draw down and prior to this there were some gain, your allocation should be still pretty intact. however if the draw down is 50%, your equity portion could be smaller, the rebalancing could be to sell some of your bonds and move them to equity.0 comments1"
