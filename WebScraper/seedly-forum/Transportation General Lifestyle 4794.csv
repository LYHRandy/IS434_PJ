https://blog.moneysmart.sg/transportation/transitlink-simplygo-abt/GIven how uni students pay the same fare as adults (if not concession is purchased) I would probably turn to using these credit cards to earn their cashbacks / rewards during the promotion period.
But ultimately, a $5 cashback equates to only approx 3 rides, therefore, it all boils down to your transport expenditure. If you were to not purchase concession and switch to SimplyGo instead, just make sure that the opportunity cost is a positive one (cashback earned  additional amount paid for not purchasing concession)0 comments0"
