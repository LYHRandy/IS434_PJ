3,Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019P2P (peer-to-peer) Lending has been gaining alot of attention recently. P2P lending offers loans for both businesses and personal use. How P2P lending works is that your money is typically pooled with other investors' money and together you make a loan to the individual asking for funds. You will then receive fixed repayments each month which includes the interest you are owed. Another alternative investment is gold. Gold is a great asset for diversifying your portfolio as it has low correlation to other asset classes and is an inflation hedge.1 comment0
