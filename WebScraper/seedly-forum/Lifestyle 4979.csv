MasterAnswered on 17 Jan 2019You can look at some of the reviews here!SInce you want more data, I actually recommend Circle's Life/ SIM only plans.However this means that you will have to pay full price for your phone, as the plans are rather cheap (currently paying 45-50 for 20GB of data)You may want to check this article out for more information!0 comments2"
