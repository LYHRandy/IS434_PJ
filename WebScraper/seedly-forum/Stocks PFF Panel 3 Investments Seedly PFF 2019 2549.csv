1,"Sandra TeoLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Hi Deborah! Valuation of ETFs are based on the ETF's NAV (net asset value). The ETF's NAV is the price at which shares are bought or sold from the fund company. Although it is important to note that a ETF's NAV can differ from its market price. Secondly, you should look at the ETF's tracking difference since ETFs are designed to track indexes. The lower the tracking difference, the better. Lastly, the fund's liquidity is another thing to look for. Investors often prefer funds that tend to trade in line with its true net asset value.
