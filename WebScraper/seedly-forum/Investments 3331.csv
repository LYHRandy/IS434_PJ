1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 10 Apr 2018I would consider using Robo-advisors... It gives you a model portfolio of overseas ETFs which allow you to invest in a low cost manner.However, word of advice! Be ready to stomach market movements up and down and also, think about the longer term! (eg 10 years) Also, please read in detail what the ETFs comprises of before investing (they will give you a breakdown of the ETFs that your portfolio comprises of eg. US, Asia Ex-Japan, Etc.)But I would highly recommend you to read a few things:The intro to Robo-advisors in Singapore: https://blog.seedly.sg/singapore-robo-advisor-investment-comparison/For you to read real reviews of Robo-advisors: https://seedly.sg/reviews/robo-advisors  show less0 comments6"

Interactive brokers, IG and brokerage houses like the above that allows you to trade overseas market.The step to go about will be:
1) Identify the ETF you want to invest in
2) Identify the exchange that it is traded on
3) Find the appropriate brokerage. DBS vickers for example, allows you to use invest in overseas exchanges. All you need to do is to apply for it.
People use Interactive brokers and such to cater to their needs at times too, such as lower fees. Do take note that some of those are custodians.Do check this article out: https://blog.seedly.sg/years-investing-local-overseas-brokers/Might help. :)0 comments2"

7,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018Firstly I'm gonna assume you have already identified the Etf you want to buy into and it is listed in the US market (most liquid place for etfs). Consider opening a thinkorswim account or an interactive brokers account. Both will give you access to the US market at one of the most competitive rates you can find. Believe IB can access other markets as well, but you'll need 10k usd to open an account 0 comments0"
8,JianHao SooLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 15 Sep 2018I have recently started an account with Maybank Monthly Investment Plan which provides $0 commission for 12 months (promo available during a roadshow) - which I feel it's pretty good for me to RSP ETF at $0 cost. This includes Nikko AM STI ETF which DBS charge 0.82%. 0 comments0
9,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The easiest way is through the use of robo-advisors (Stashaway/AutoWealth/Smartly) which charges different fees depending on how much you invest with them. However, the downside is that you're unable to choose the ETFs that you would like to invest in. On the other hand, if you know which ETF you would like to invest in, you can do so directly and you might even save on some fees.1 comment0"
10,"Loh Tat Tian24 Aug 2018I found by adjusting my risk level, I'm able to selectively select the composition i wish to put into (etc, if current fund from inception earns XX%, You can force sell by choosing a less / more risk component. However, take note to check properly what funds you want based on their risk profile."
