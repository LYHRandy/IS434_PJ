1,"CPF BoardLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 05 Aug 2019Hi Gabriel,For CPF savings to be distributed to a missing member‚Äôs nominees, a presumption of death certificate, which declares the missing person is presumed to be dead, has to be obtained.Upon a member‚Äôs demise, CPF savings will be distributed to the member‚Äôs nominees according to the member‚Äôs wishes, if the member had made a CPF nomination. If no nomination was made, the member‚Äôs CPF savings will be paid to the Public Trustee for distribution to family members in accordance with the intestacy laws or inheritance certificate (for Muslims) in Singapore.Hope the above clarifies.0 comments5"

You'll then be able to request to declare them dead by the government and get a death cert for the above mentioned purposes.1 comment4"
