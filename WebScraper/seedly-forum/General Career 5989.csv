2,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Sep 2018$2500 is not too bad lah. I had been offered $1500 before and they even said : Take it or leave it in my face.  There are a lot of foreign talent willing to take the job. 
If it is $1500, say no to exploitation but if it is $2500, not bad lah. 0 comments1"

I'd suggest taking up the offer. Get some corporate experience, work on a portfolio of achievements, then move on to something greater. All the best0 comments0"

7,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Sep 20182.5k may not seems much. But the factor you should look at is that if there's good learning , good mentor, good skills / experience to pick up ( check out and network to talk to other more mature marketing personnel ), if it does provides these good grooming factor, while you still in the middle of looking, then it is wise to take up this to learn first. If something better comes along not only monetary but also good training , mentorship , still not too late to switch over. Doing something is better than doing nothing üòÅ. Moving , learning and opportunity will come along ! üòÑ Cheers üëç0 comments0"
