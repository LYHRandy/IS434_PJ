1,"Kenneth LouLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi there! I will just add on to what Randall has already shared :) Firstly it is important to know what CPF is for and why you need to find a way to protect this nest egg of yours.​I would recommend you not to touch it as it already will be giving you 2.5% per annum interest just by sitting in your CPF OA (ordinary account)​You'll be able to touch this money when you need it later for these purposes - Property, Education, etc. The 2.5% is risk free and thus highly recommended to let it compound while you study.​​This is detailed in the article as Strategy 3, where you keep your OA and SA Seperate. This is the default strategy that any working adult would adopt. The allocation for the SA vs OA will change over the years as you reach retirement age.​Pros:By keeping the OA and SA separate, it gives you the flexibility of both Cash and the OA funds for other opportunitiesArgued by a Business Times Contributor, he felt that by letting the OA build over time with 2.5% it gives you the opportunity to pounce on the property marketCons:This is by betting big on the property market in Singapore and believing in the appreciation of property being more than 4% p.aAlso by betting on the SG government to not change any of the various property cooling measures which will make the property market less attractive for rent or appreciation.You can find out about this in this detailed article here: https://blog.seedly.sg/should-you-transfer-cpf-oa-to-sa/2 comments2"
2,"Hoon Thien Rong18 Jul 2018Reading on the cooling measure, I think it is true on the 4% too as it is subject to govt yearly reviews.Kenneth Lou19 Jul 2018yeah agreed haha. I think property is a game which has passed our generation. We needa find newer and more up-to-date methods to grow wealth. :)"

ProdigyAnswered on 13 Jul 2018Given your situation, I would recommend you the following:​Do nothing to CPF​Account balance up to $60,000 will enjoy additional 1% Ordinary Account (OA) – 3.5%Special Account (SA) – 5%Medisave Account (MA) – 5%Transfer OA to SA to enjoy higher interests of 5%​I would leave it in OA or transfer to SA given that CPF pays good interests.​​But if you still insist on taking the risk, do check out this article before taking the plunge.​https://dollarsandsense.sg/cpfis-5-reasons-not-rush-invest-cpf-monies/0 comments1"

6,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 11 Apr 2019Hello! In order to use your cpf to invest you will need to open either a CPFIS-OA (Ordinary Account) or a CPFIS-SA (Special Account) A CPFIS-OA will require you to open a CPF Investment Account with DBS, OCBC or UOB while the CPFIS-SA does not require you to open an account, you will just need to approach the investment product provider directly. However, as many people mentioned there are minimum amounts to adhere to in order to be able to invest, $20,000 in OA and $40,0000 in SA. Here is a brief overview of the various investments that is you can invest in with your cpf! 0 comments0"

9,"Rave Ong Ci DeLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 15 Jul 20182k cannot invest, as CPF would not allow. ​Assuming you can invest, you would need to have a CDP account, as well as go to any of the three local banks to set up an Investment Account(CPF-IA). Once this is set up, just do as per normal for stock transactions, except changing the mode of payment to CPF. ​Do note that as CPF is suppose to be your retirement funds, it is stricter in that sense. So some of the things, such as shorting a stock, would not be allowed. ​I recommend that you try out investing with your cash to get a feel on how it is like to invest, before using CPF to do so. 0 comments0"
