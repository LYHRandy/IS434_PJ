God of WisdomAnswered 6d agoHi,1) You'll have to go back to the broker you opened the investment account with to check. (I assume you are talking about a trading account) Most of the time the account will still be there, and probably just needs a reset of password to be usable again.2) Do you mean you currently have an Asian fund that is already invested via CPF OA monies but hasn't changed value much? Then you are already set up to invest via CPF OA. I don't recommend using CPF SA to invest due to the high interest. If that is not the case, you need to open a CPF OA investment account with any local bank to invest CPF OA monies.3) I'd recommend looking for an independent financial advisor who carries a wide range of products, so as to have better access to the instruments on the market. Have a conversation with them and see who you are comfortable to work with.0 comments4"
2,"Lean Sing Ding, Client Experience Lead at EndowusLevel 2. RookieAnswered 5d agoHi there!1.) Are you referring to your CPF Investment Account (CPF IA)? If you are - Here is how to look up your existing CPF Investment Account Number: - Login to CPF website with your Singpass to access my CPF Online Services - Navigate to My Statement  Section C - Click Investment - You will see your agent bank and the CPF Investment Account number.2.) Assuming you already have a CPF IA - you are already ready to utilize your CPF Monies to invest. But as there is a multitude of instruments catering to different sort of investors with different goals, risk appetite - please ensure you understand the risks and costs involved in the instrument you are interested in before investing. Please see https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/optimising-my-cpf/cpf-investment-schemes for more information.If you do not have a CPF IA account - just head to your respective local bank (DBS/UOB/OCBC) websites - they would have information to guide you to open the account.3.) There are a multitude of banks/financial institutions/robo-advisors/fee-based advisors for you to choose from. Many people have different experiences with these different platforms - my encouragement to you is to began to read widely - there are good financial blogs out that do comparison of different platforms and modes of investment.
Personally, the best place to start investing - is to invest in one's financial knowledge. As mentioned there are many free educational materials online - just google and start reading it. Armed with basic financial knowledge - you have given yourself the best chance of success.All the best!""Be Globally Diversified, Keep cost low, and Stay Invested""0 comments1"

Having knowledge of the tool gives me a better idea of how I expect returns and reduces investment risks. Risks come from not knowing what I'm doing.Considered investing in your own education before seeking advice?0 comments0
