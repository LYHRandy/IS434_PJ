1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Nov 2018Hi, I would recommend the CIMB Awesome (AWSM) Credit Card which has no annual fees and gives 1% cashback for spending on Dining & Entertainment, Online Shopping (Qoo10, Shopee, Lazada, ASOS, Zalora etc.) and Telco (M1/Starhub/Singtel/Circles). You can apply online and you'll be able to get $30 credit if you spend at least $100 on the following categories as mentioned above within 2 months of your card approval. Also, I believe that you stand a chance to get a Sentosa Wavehouse ticket worth $40 upon signing up. You can check it out here - https://www.cimbbank.com.sg/en/personal/products/cards/credit-cards/cimb-awsm-card.htmlYou can also consider the Maybank eVibes Credit Card which gives 1% cashback on all retail transactions and comes with a $5 quarterly fee, but it can be waived so long as you charge to your card. 0 comments0"
