MasterAnswered on 07 Feb 2019To be true to its name, its basically a daily hospital cash plan for days that you are hospitalised (be it from accident, sickness, etc). Its underwritten by chubb. For this kind of insurance, it depends on whether you think you require it.The more generic ones are the ISP (integrated shield plans), which have a daily hospital benefit provided you bought private shield plan with rider and stay in a public hospital A ward instead.0 comments1"
