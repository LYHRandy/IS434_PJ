2,"Tai ZhiLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jul 2018There are some financial literature out there regarding whether an investor should invest all-in or time-diversify his/her investments over time.​Empirically, financial markets generally appreciates over time. Therefore, an investor faces material opportunity cost for not investing his/her full investible assets. The risk for an investor investing all-in is the small probability of experiencing a market correction immediately thereafter.​On balance, the benefits of investing all-in outweigh the risks. Therefore, the most rational, calculated investment decision will be to invest all-in.​That said, it also depends how well you can manage your emotions psychologically if in case the risks does materialise despite you taking a calculated rational investment decision.​If you feel more comfortable, you may want to commit 50% at the start and commit the remaining 50% over 2-3 quarters to mitigate the probability of meeting a market correction shortly after the initial 50%. 0 comments0"
