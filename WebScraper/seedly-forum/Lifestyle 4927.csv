1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Mar 2019Highest payout per month would be this app called Milieu. I use it daily.I also use opinion world, rakuten, and google opinion. Rakuten is pretty fast too. Google opinion only gives you google credits, not cash. So if you want to use those credits to buy apps/in-app stuff, then go ahead :)0 comments1"
2,"Margarette Nicole SantosLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 19 Mar 2019I have used Rakuten,The Panel Station and Toluna.So far i find Rakuten and Toluna the best in terms of the survey types. Unfortunately for Rakuten, some surveys can also be accessed thru desktop which can be inconvenient at times.I have tried to claim rewards from Toluna. Payout was fast. I received the Dairy Farm voucher in my mail in a week.As per Rakuten, i haven't tried to claim rewards but I think the payout is slower as the grocery vouchers has a specific cut off deadline for claiming which can take up to a month or so.0 comments0"
