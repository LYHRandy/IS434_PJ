1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardUpdated on 26 Aug 2019I like to check the MAS Investor Alert list:  https://www.mas.gov.sg/investor-alert-list  - for eg. iQuadrant was one of them.
As such when you see such ads, it's always good practice to check against this list.
Side note: Clearly they indicated your demographic when they did their Facebook ad targetting!1 comment1"
2,"Question Poster26 Aug 2019Yup, so if it's an offshore company using Facebook targeting, even if it's a scam, there's nothing MAS can do anything to the offshore company right? just put on alert list to 'warn' consumers."
3,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 26 Aug 2019Most are not regulated. They just put a disclaimer that the course is educational purposes only and not meant to be financial advice etc etc etc.Be wary, selling courses is very lucrative when they promise some magical formula to forex trading success.4 comments0"
4,"See all 4 comments Gabriel Tham23 Aug 2019Yes, if its on MAS alert, please be careful. It could mean they do not have license yet but there is no criminal activity detected too.Question Poster26 Aug 2019Thank You!"
