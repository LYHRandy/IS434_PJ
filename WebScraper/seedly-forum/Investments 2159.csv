1,"Gabriel Tham, Kenichi Tag Team Member at Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 18 Mar 2019You should receive an official notice stating how many units you are entitled to subscribe to.Then the notice will also state the methods you can use to apply, usually is through ATM/ibanking or cashier's order.Since the preferential offering opens on March 27th, you should receive the notice after that. Probably 1-2 days for snail mail to arrive.1 comment0"
