1,"Cherie Julianne Tan, Content Strategist at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Like every other investment, it is very important to do your own research. Some tips I would suggest would be:Do you own researchLook at their competition - tech is a very competitive space. Are they doing anything to stay competitive and relevant? Are they innovating yet staying true to their core (mission)? Are their products easy to replicate?Scalability: Is it a company that is able to scale?Macro-scale direction: Where is the company headed to? Is it forward moving or are they stagnating?And yes, I agree with Gabriel, never follow people's tips blindly! Follow up with what you've heard with a simple google search.Never never invest in something you don't believe in, you would want a good night's rest! Hope this helps! :)2 comments4"
