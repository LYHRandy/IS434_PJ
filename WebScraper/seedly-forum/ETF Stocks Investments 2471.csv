1,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey Joel, I personally do it via Roboadvisors, as it is the most cost effective way to do so. Alternatively another fuss-free way would be to do so via your exisitng brokerage. (eg DBS Vickers etc) fees would range around USD10 to 20 per trade if I remember correctly.2 comments1"
2,"HRHansel Raphael Chew05 Jun 2019Hi Kenneth, could you share how Roboadvisors would be a more cost effective way to buy the index fund compared to brokerages? I'm not too familiar with the fees involved with Roboadvisors.Kenneth Lou07 Jun 2019Hi Hansel! Basically robo-advisors have a cost of between 0.5 to 1% AUM. Compared to brokerages if you do it monthly, the fees will be way more exorbidant. That is for those who invest monthly!"

Easy to do at many banks in Singapore.Buy a Vanguard ETF VUSA from the London Stock Exchange rather than from a US-based one to avoid tax implications.Reinvest the quarterly dividends to maximise your compounding benefits.4 comments1
4,"See all 4 comments NSNicholas Stone15 Jun 2019Joel - you need an international brokerage account, yes. It's relatively easy to set one up. I use Interactive Brokers, but previously used Saxo and Standard Chartered.NSNicholas Stone15 Jun 2019Hansel, there is a US estate tax that there is a theoretical chance you can be hit with.

For this reason I buy all my ETFS from the LSE."
