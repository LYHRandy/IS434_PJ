God of WisdomAnswered on 06 Aug 2019James, $40K is probably best deployed after you look at your own objectives and decide what are you expecting from your investments. REITs are merely one of the many asset classes. As you have mentioned, you took years to save that $40K, so please ensure you manage the risk of your investment portfolio as well, and diversifying your asset classes is one of the ways. Your question is rather general, so it is hard to give a specific answer, but I hope you have some ideas now.0 comments4"

4,"Kenneth ChanLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 06 Aug 2019IMHO you should NEVER ask if you should put $X amount into Y. Financial Advisors' biases or other personal agendas will most likely bite you where you least expect it.Perhaps you should instead arm yourself with risks and downsides of the investment you are looking to do (in this case REITs) and make a judgement if you are willing to accept these risks continue with your investment.You may have to top up your holdings (when the management decides to purchase new proerty/estate to add to their portfolio) or risk dilution.REITs prices do not generally ""grow"".REITs generally faces risk asscociated with the property market ""boom and bust"" too.Good luck!0 comments1"
5,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 09 Aug 2019Depends on what your investment risk appetite is like!
I would split up my $40k into a more balanced portfolio.Usually it's between Equity and Bonds.Buying REITs are like Equity, which should weigh heavier for a longer time horizon and more risk profile. Most risky: 80% Equity, 20% Bond  10 year time horizonBalanced: 60% Equity, 40% Bond  5 year time horizonLeast risky: 20% Equity, 80% Bond  2 year time horizon2 comments1"
