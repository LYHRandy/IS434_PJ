question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 01 Feb 2019Does it make sense to buy Limited Pay Term Plans?Saw that there are new launches by the insurers which included the limited pay functions into their term plan. What are the pros and cons of owning a limited pay term plan as compared to regular pay other than price differences?And if I were to buy a LP term plan that covers up to 100, would this be similar to owning a whole life plan in terms of protection? I would understand that there are no cash values in the term plans of course.3 answersAnswerBump0"

God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you want insurance for post retirement, it would make sense to get limited pay policies as you may not want to have a cashflow issue after retirement while maintaining your policy.1 comment2"

3,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Feb 2019The advantage of BTIR (Buy Term Invest Rest) is somehow mitigated if one selects a limited pay term plan. The aim of the BTIR strategy is to minimise insurance expense to maximise the remaining cashflow into investments. A limited pay Term Plan may simply mean that you are sacrificing cashflow in your initial years to pay for an expense, hence, depending on the maths and investment expertise of the individual, one may actually be better off getting a whole life plan if the concern is whole life coverage. Coupled with the fact that most people would prefer to have CI coverage, Whole Life plan would make more sense since the cash value can be a form of safety net in the future since investment returns are never guaranteed.0 comments0"

If you're not, you'd be better off with a whole life plan regardless. Pros are generally lifelong insurance.Cons are cost and zero cash values. 0 comments0"
