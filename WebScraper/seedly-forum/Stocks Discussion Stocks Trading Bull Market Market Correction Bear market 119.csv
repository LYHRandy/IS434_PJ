1,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 29 Jun 2019A virtual account is good for you to practice your investment rationale and thesis but it negates the emotional factor behind investing which I find is a considerable and significant factor in determining how one executes their trades in reality.
i.e. When one's virtual account drops 50%, one is still able to sleep soundly, but if that occurs in real life where money is real, the pinch and emotional attachment behind that monetary value would be very different.
Here's some virtual accounts you might want to try out your investments on: https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/Tradehero (on Android and Apple)But my 2 cents of advice, try investing with real money, put in a small amount, buy into a sound + reputable company and try dabbing your toes in investing.0 comments2"

A virtual or demo account is simply for you to test out new products or hypothesis of trading strategies/systems (of which you can also simply just run simulations in some environments instead).Nothing beats trading real money, thus do yourself a favour, open and fund a small real account somewhere, and trade it. See and learn about your own trading psychology, learn about risk management in addition to the usual more interesting trading strategies, and you will find consistent profits coming for you earlier than your friends who have gone the virtual account route.0 comments0"
