question,"Career Asked by AnonymousAsked on 09 Nov 2018Would you choose a high stress job for higher pay and better benefits or lower stress job for decent pay?Would you choose 1) a high stress job which requires frequent OTing (past 2am) & constantly having to navigate sudden and huge changes from upper management. Industry is super fast paced and constantly active or 2) a lower stress job tt does not provide benefits (e.g. medical, dental, gym, telecomm) and lower pay ($200 lesser/mth) but still has ample room for growth albeit growth rate slower than (1), impact of contributions is greater for (2). Assume you are in your late 20s and no dependants.5 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel LeeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Nov 2018I'll definitely go for the second option, lesser stress but does not provide benefits. Even though you're still young, constantly having to work overtime past 2am is bad for your health and also reduces your sleep, which might cause more severe illnesses in the near future. Also, it deters you from personal, social and family time. Life is short, cherish and enjoy to the fullest! 0 comments0"
2,"As DfLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Nov 2018If impact of contribution is greater for #2, why would the growth rate be lower? You want to be known for effectiveness, not just speed and efficiency.You're young enough to go for the one that will position you better for future jumps - I'm not sure that would necessarily be #1 though if  it's just fast paced but routine work.0 comments0"
3,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 09 Nov 2018I'd prefer the lower stress job. Because ultimately i earn so that i can live my life comfortably. If I am constantly stressed and working OT past 2am, then there isn't much meaning to my life anymore. I wouldn't have time for anything else.0 comments0"
