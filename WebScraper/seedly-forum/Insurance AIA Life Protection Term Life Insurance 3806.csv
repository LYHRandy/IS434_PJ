God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hey Anon, here's a rule of thumb you can follow for amount of coverage you should have.In the event of death and permanent disability: 10 X your Annual IncomeIn the event of Critical Illness: 5 X your annual income.So if you're making 50k a year, you should have 500k in Death Cover and 250k in CI cover.AIA TCC has a staggered payout schedule and doesn't pay 300k upfront. It pays 100k and then goes on a reset period where after 12 months iirc you can claim again. So treat it like you have 100k cover only.Now, all insurance companies have term life plans that you are looking for, but if you'd like a comparison from 7 different insurers, drop me a message on FB and I'll assist you. I'm an IFA rep, so I represent multiple insurers. :)2 comments1"
2,"Question Poster27 May 2019Okay, looks like ill check how to raise my coverage for AIA TCC i guess. I will consider the term life plan and pm u. Thank you!Hariz Arthur Maloy27 May 2019You may not be able to raise your coverage after 6 months of purchase. You'd most likely need to purchase a different plan. But before that, you may want to check this article out. It places TCC next to other similar plans from other insurers. https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion/navigating-critical-illness-plans?amp"

You might want to explore life or term policy that cover about 5 times of your annual income should be fine. The only time that you need to revise your coverage is when you have new liabilities and responsibility (new house, first child etc)0 comments0"
