1,"Sin Ting So, Head Of Client Experience at EndowusLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 16 May 2019Dear Anonymous, Nobel prize-winning economist Markowitz called diversification “the only free lunch in finance.”  His theory is that if you hold a portfolio of investments that are not perfectly correlated, an investor can lower risk without sacrificing expected returns. Simply put, spreading your investments across asset classes and geographies gets you the same reward with less risk = free lunch! We think it's important to invest in a globally diversified portfolio rather than just in the S&P 500 Index , given how difficult it is to accurately predict the best (or wost) performing asset class or geographical region in a given year.  Here's an interesting chart of past 10 years of returns along with the annualized 10 year results for various asset classes from A Wealth of Common Sense:Diversification is not particularly exciting, but it reduces the risk of blow-ups due to any single investment. A diversified portfolio will always have a few investments that are not doing so well, a few that are average, and hopefully a few that do great. The thing is – this is random and beyond our control, but if we are diversified, on average we will do just fine. There will be times when you wonder why you didn’t just put all your money in S&P 500 ETF (or Netflix shares), but the value of diversification needs to be judged over years. Financial advisors such as Endowus can help advise you on how to create a diversified and holistic asset allocation portfolios appropriate for your investment goals, time horizon and risk tolerance. Each portfolio is selected as the result of a systematic portfolio optimization process that strives to deliver portfolios which maximise expected returns for each level of risk.0 comments0"

This means that it is based on 500 large companies having common stock listed on the NYSE/NASDAQ.Robo-advisors will look across different equity markets to allow for diversification.0 comments0"

What happens if the U.S.-China trade disputes escalates and causes its equity markets to decline?Most robo-advisors help clients to diversify broadly.Most robo-advisors, which uses ETFs as the underlying investment instruments (not all uses ETFs, DBS digiPortfolio uses high-fees unit trusts), help clients to invest at a very low cost (lower than if they were to DIY).Robo-advisors also offer a hassle-free service, which takes away the need to track markets on a day-to-day basis.You may check out our value propositions at this url: https://www.autowealth.sg/0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 03 Mar 2019Because robo advisors usually dont sell a single ETFs, they do portfolio allocation based on customer risk appetite. You wan to buy S&P 500, you have to go through a normal broker like DBS, Charles Schwab and so on.0 comments0"
