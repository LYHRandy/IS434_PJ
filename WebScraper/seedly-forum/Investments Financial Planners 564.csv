MasterAnswered on 10 Sep 2019I gave some of my personal thoughts here on Christopher and the company as people. Structurally and professionally, I was very impressed.You need to be of high net worth to pay for the fees, though. I can only assume you will get top quality advice because they take their end product extremely seriously - which you should since a fee is fixed regardless of affordability. You pay for results.
