WizardUpdated on 10 Apr 2019Private tuition - definitely more than $15 an hourWork out instructor - if you are able to (and also qualified), teaching group classes would pay more than $15 an hour. I think this spans anything from yoga to HIIT to zumbaDog walking - apparently it pays anywhere from $13-25 per walkOn a same thread - pet sitting. Said to pay $15 an hourIf you are skilled in video editting/photoshop/graphic design - take up projects on the sideLikewise for writing good copy0 comments3"
