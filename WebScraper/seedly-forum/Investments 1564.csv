1,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 20 Apr 2019There are several ETFs that track the S&P500 and SPY is the most popular of them all (to me). Now puts can be separated into 2 types, buy or sell. Same as for calls. A simple breakdown is as follows:Buy puts / sell calls - you are bearish about the stock/counter 
Sell puts / buy calls - you are bullish about the stock/counterWhen you buy an option, you pay a premium, and the opposite happens when you sell an option (you collect premium). Which is why I always prefer selling put as in general most of the stocks in my list go up. You earn an income from selling and you keep the premium when the option expires. You should only buy options when you are very sure about the direction of a stock. Else the premium you pay will drop in value. Hope this provides a bit of insight into options.0 comments2"

MasterAnswered on 18 Apr 2019SPY is the code for SPDR S&P 500 whereby it tracks the S&P 500 and is offered by SPDR. Put = Sell, Call = Buy.Okay, I ain't no experts at Options. You could possibly read up on how options works but the underlying theory is to provide you the ability to exercise the option of possibly buying or selling the stock at a particular price.
