1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 28 Feb 2019Yes there's a way to calculate inflation adjusted returns.the formula is ""real return=(1+nominal return)/(1+inflation) - 1""a more dirty method but less accurate method is real return= nominal return - inflaiton.  nominal return is just the dollar value of any return. inflation can be calculated by the percentage increase of the consumer price index over time.0 comments2"
