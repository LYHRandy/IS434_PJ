It's a multi asset US specific fund that invests in High Yield Bonds, Converticle Bonds, and US Equities hedged to the Singapore Dollar and distributes dividends monthly.Current annualized dividend yield is 8.43%. Fund has grown 7.22% on a compounded basis since inception in July 2013. The all in fund management fee is 1.5% which is pretty standard of Actively Managed Unit Trusts.Just note that fund should be quite sensitive to interest rates and default risk due to nature of the high yield bonds.
A great addition to your portfolio if you're looking for dividends and some long term growth and bullish on the US economy.0 comments3"
