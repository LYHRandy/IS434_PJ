WonderkidAnswered on 26 May 2019Hola, Douglas here, 2nd Keynote speaker from the event.Your qn is kinda too open ended for me to give you concise advisory. Assuming our property market continues the steady growth that the government prefers, the price of a purchased new launch should appreciate 10 to 20 % after it TOP. Some folks will choose to sell it rightaway after TOP to profit once they have passed the window to NOT have to pay seller stamp duty. Some will want to hold as a long term asset for rental income, while anticipating future price appreciation.The choice is pretty subjective depending on your choice of investment strategy. We just have to nimble and understand how our personal circumstances change.​​​
