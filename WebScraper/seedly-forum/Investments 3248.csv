WonderkidAnswered on 17 Oct 2018I think that you have got the idea for your question instead I would like to add mine in it.I believe that you should stop overthinking on saving and investment. There is a famous saying."" Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving ""And in your case, I would like to say that emergency fund are our life lines. We don't know when and where we need them. If you are getting attracted towards stock price, I want to say that Are they more important than your life? if Yes, than go and buy them right now. and If not, then you got your answer.0 comments0"

There is always opportunities for investment. :) And if you are really interested in investment, you can save a portion of your income for opportunities while another portion for regular saving/investment. The portion saved for opportunities may be use to investment education too. wish you all the best in your investment journey. :) 0 comments0"

Stocks are considered risky so it's important to ensure that you have another set of emergency funds should anything happen. Rule of thumb is to invest with money that you can afford to lose. 0 comments0

If you need money asap during a bear market, its better to use your emergency fund first than selling your investment and have no choice but to make a loss.0 comments0"

There'll always be opportunities to grow wealth, but never an opportunity to recover from requiring a rainy day fund when you don't have one. It could be the difference between life and death.Need to be diligent and put some money aside. 0 comments0"
