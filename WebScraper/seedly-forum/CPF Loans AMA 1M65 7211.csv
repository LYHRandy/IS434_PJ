1,"Good Day Every DayLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 30 Nov 2018Yes, it is advisable. The interest of your fixed deposit is lower than the interest of your CPF OA. Hence it makes sense to use cash instead of CPF OA to repay your hdb mortgage. 0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 07 Nov 2018I am a believer that if you can harness the high interest from the CPF Special Account (4%), I should consider a HDB loan quite healthy because it only carries about 0.1% above the OA interest rate (currently at 2.5%) and I can arbitrage the difference. Hence, I advocate the use of a housing mortgage loan as a means to arbitrage between the Special Account and HDB Housing Loan.0 comments0"
