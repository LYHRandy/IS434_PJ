1,"Gavin TanLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 17 Jul 2019Woahhh 19 with 15k savings +1k side income monthly, that's impressive! You should pat yourself on the back! I'm your age as well and I just started investing not too long ago!It all comes down to your risk appetite, for me i dove right into individual stocks, went for REITs, Blue Chips, etc. Firstly find out whats your risk appetite! If you have a low risk appetite then something safe like Singapore Savings Bond (SSB) or STI ETFs would be pretty good since in the long term you'll be gaining decent returns. Robo advisors are also great since it's similar to your DBS RSP, but you'll be vested in the global markets like US etc. rather than just in Singapore. I'd say Stashaway is pretty good, since you can optimize your portfolio according to your risk appetite!If you like a challenge, I'd say learn how to stock pick, don't think too much into it. Many people assume, ""Oh I need to have a big capital to start"" or ""Oh I don't know how to choose"". Firstly, I started out with 2k capital sooo don't worry about the capital since you have 15k to play with. Secondly, the internet is full of helpful information and it's all free! I learnt everything from videos and reading articles etc. Also there is a misconception that you must pick 30-50 stocks, but trust me, being invested in 10-20 is more than enough !!Good luck in your investing journey and for school as well !0 comments1"

A better option would be roboadvisors. Being young, you can also consider putting some money into more risker instruments such as P2P lending and cryptocurrency stablecoin lending(Look into Blockfi, Dai, Celcius)0 comments0"

That being said, what you're currently doing is ok.However, if starting university does not affect your passive income, then you have a lot of thinking and planning to do.You have $300 in ETF and investing in this and robo advisors are kind of like the same category (in my honest opinion). The balance of money should be diversified with the following considerations:
1) risk appetite: lower risk stuff from bank deposits (1%p.a. onwards) and insurance savings (3%p.a. to 4%p.a.) to higher risk stuff from shares (which gives passive income in the form of dividends) to speculative trading (sky's the limit but you need time and skill)
2) time horizon: how many years are you able to lock up your money when they are left in investments? I hope you do know that investing in ETFs will need about 5 years to see significant returns. Bank deposits and savings have short time horizon (a few months or almost instant liquidity), shares and etc have mid term horizon (people may hold positions for weeks to months, up to a year in trading, or for longer periods if they're keeping it for passive returns). Insurance savings have longest time horizon, 10 years onwards.
3) what are your goals - you don't only have one goal so you should split the pot strategically to reach your goals. Some goals need more time and are more important and will need something more stable. Other goals may have shorter deadlines but you can be more aggressive 
4) is there a way to increase your side income? If you took little effort to get $1k monthly, is it scalable? If it's scalable why not use your side income to generate more side income?Lastly, as for the $15k savings, I'd suggest leaving it alone for emergency use. If you already have emergency fund set aside, perhaps putting the money into any one or more of the above mentioned instruments can be done.0 comments0"

FreshieAnswered on 17 Jul 2019If you're looking for a more conservative approach and long term, you can always look up on savings bonds (SSB) as it is one of the best options for investors with any risk appetite and you can redeem before maturity incase you need the money.
You can consider putting 10K into bonds, and the remaning 5K on something like Robo-invest or higher risk alternatives.
Robo-invest is something for people who have no time, or are not sure how to first invest. You can consider to do your research on companies such as StashAway.0 comments0"
