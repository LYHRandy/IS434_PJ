3,"Eveline LauLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 23 Apr 2019As much as possible, ceteris paribus. Even though people say that money can't buy happiness, money can help you settle a lot of problems (e.g. housing, study debt) and pay for things that make you happy (e.g. holiday, food). But this is on the basis that the wealth doesn't come in exchange of your health or time. Of the 3 aspects, wealth should have the lowest priority. You can (theoretically) achieve happiness without wealth, but you cannot enjoy happiness if you don't have health and time.0 comments1"
4,"Heng Kai Le, Mondomover at School Of LifeLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered on 07 Jun 2019It is not exactly that I feel unhappy with my income now, but I feel that I can breathe slightly easier if I earn $500-600 more. Though of course I am aware that if I get a pay rise or side hustles that will bring me this amount, I will still feel uneasy and hanker after $500-600 more so that I feel as if I have the room to stretch my finances. So maybe the crux of this issue is me learning to appreciate what I already earn. :)0 comments0"
