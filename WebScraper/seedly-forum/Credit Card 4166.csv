question,"Credit Card Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Apr 2019What credit card for 10K one time expense?I have a 10K expense coming up and wonder what credit card I should sign up for? Currently using a HSBC Advance cashback that gives me 3.5% cashback for my average monthly spend of $3000. The 10K expense merchant does not accept Amex. From my research, the sign up bonus for Amex KF Ascend is attractive and I wonder if pushing the 10K payment to HSBC (cashback limited to first 4K spend) while averaging monthly expense to KF Ascend is a good move.2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 24 Apr 2019Are you team cashback or team miles? I strongly suggest not to mix cards from the different ""teams"".You can get the SC Manhatten card, which gives you 3% cashback and their on-going promotion with Grab means you earn more cashback from your grab rides.Might want to look into that. Another card to look might be the OCBC 365 card. 6% caschback on dining looks good.To me, if you don't have a plan for miles accumulation, getting the KF Ascend card is a miss opprtunity, not to mention that the fist year annual fee of  $337.05 is not waived.0 comments0"

It has good sign up bonus perks, you can earn 30,000 miles if you spend 7k on the first three months and pay your annual fees! You can check out this question I asked previously about whether it's worth it to spend on the annual fee for the extra miles. https://seedly.sg/questions/should-i-pay-192-annual-fee-for-my-credit-card-to-get-21-000-miles?utm_source=question_share&utm_medium=internal0 comments0"
