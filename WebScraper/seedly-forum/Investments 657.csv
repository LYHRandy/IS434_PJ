5,"Tee-Ming Chew, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 21 Aug 2019Robinhood is a commission free stock trading platform and they don't charge any fee when you trade with them. However, the SEC and FINRA do charge a small fee for stock sell orders.If you're wondering what is their business model, they actually earn from Robinhood Gold (their premium subscription) and from the interest on money stored on the Robinhood accounts.Hope that helps!1 comment1"
6,Lam Ka Ying21 Aug 2019Just wondering if you have to pay any taxes (withholding or capital gain) for the trades you make?
7,"Lam Ka YingLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 21 Aug 2019Hi, you will need an SSN to open an account so most likely you will need to have some working experience for foreigners. That said, it is completely free to trade as they charge for other services. You can read up more on their business model online :)0 comments0"
