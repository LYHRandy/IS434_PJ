1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 16 Apr 2019Whilst its good to read up on various resources, the best way is to just get started. Start small. You will find that sometimes when you throw yourself into a deep end of the pool, you will then have the real questions and be more focused when reading up.0 comments1"
2,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 2019Hello! Just like what most people have mentioned, I would suggest that you start with reading blog posts from seedly! The posts written on the blogs are very easy to read for a beginner investor.If you have more time on your hand to spare, I wouls suggest reading investment books that teaches you how to invest like investing for dummies. Reading up about investments would be the best way to learn more about investing. Other sources that you can refer to would be investopedia. Investopedia touches a lot about the technical terms. Hope this helps and all the best in your investment journey!0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 16 Apr 2019Everyone starts somewhere.Like what Gabriel mentioned, it would be good to start checking out articles by seedly and read through some of the Investing 101 questions that were previously answered by the fellow community.You can also start by reading up on books and articles related to investing.After grasping the fundamentals of investing, the next thing is your risk profile/appetite to determine what kind of investments would suit you.0 comments0"
