Build up your emergency funds (6~ 12 months of expenses) and pay off your existing loans first before you go into investing. While doing so, you can read up and research on the different investment products available. Have your insurance set up as well (insurance is part of your defenses together with your emergency funds)Also, look at expected expenses in next 5 to 10years (big purchase items such as further Education loan, BTO, Renovation etc). You can invest in lower risk products for these purchases. Have a plan/Budget to monitor your spending, income, savings etc. You will have a better idea where you can reduce your expenditure to increase your savingsAs you are young, you can invest in the higher risk options and you but if you are risk adverse, go for low risk investment products. Also, diversify by investing more than one products. (Do not keep all eggs in one basket)Investment products (not limited to the below)
1. DCA into ETFs (DIY or through regular saving plans)
2. Roboadvisors
3. P2P Platforms
4. Stocks
5. Bonds (e.g. SSB)
6. Endowment plan/ Investment linked policy (by Insurers)
