1,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The moment you hear ""without risk"" you can almost immediately dismiss it as false. There is no such thing as no risk. Even for CPF SA, if one day government policy changes, or if the political party changes, then who knows what will happen to our CPF? However, the chances of that happening is very low, therefore it is considered as one of the highest returns with the lowest risks.Other than this, there is no ""one product"" that I know of that will generate this amount of increase with absolutely no risk. There are ways you can diversify your risk and earn through multiple products while reducing the risk though!3 comments1"
2,"See all 3 comments Leong Wen Fong16 Nov 2018I wouldn't say no risk, but close to none yes. Bonds are the same as ""lending"" to a country. So if Singapore falls to ruins, then you would lose your money. But of course SSB interest rate is not even really even enough to cover inflation rateQuestion Poster20 Nov 2018What would be a better option than SSB for me if I am not financially savvy. "
3,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 15 Nov 2018For singapore market, the singapore government securities should be used as baseline reference as 'risk-free', 10yr is about 2.5%, 30yrs only 2.9%. Anything else in the market with a higher return than the riskfree rate carries a corresponding in increased 'risk level'. So 5-7% without risk is not possible, without any terms & condition. Always get your financial planner to put what he said into writing(and make sure u witness it and keep a copy), if u decide to take on the product. So that in future there will be at least recourse for u. 0 comments0"
