1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 28 Feb 2019Cost of capital is the required return necessary to make a capital budgeting project, such as building a new factory, worthwhile. It includes the cost of debt and the cost of equity, and is used by companies internally to judge whether a capital project is worth the expenditure of resources, and by investors who use it to determine whether an investment is worth the risk compared to the return.  Hope this helps!0 comments1"

It also a measure of risk and investors use it as a measure of risk compared to return.Cost of capital also represents opportunity cost of the capital invested, since the capital could be allocated elsewhere to generate returns too. Cost of capital can comprise of both cost of debt and cost of equity, as represented by how the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) is calculated. it can be used as a discount rate also, with wacc being used in discounted cashflow analysis for instance0 comments1"
