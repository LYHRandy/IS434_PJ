1,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 06 Nov 2018Without going into technicality, the simple difference:POSB invest saver gives u 2 choice of funds to invest in.  One that tracks the singapore straits times index, and the other a Singapore bond index. One linked to stocks, other linked to bonds. For their unit trust, there are alot for u to choose from. Different unit trust can have different investment themes. From a specific sector to a specific country etc. So if u know what u want to invest in, u can choose the specific unit trust. But If u just want to get exposure and satisfied with the STI and relatively safer singapore bonds, without need for doing too much due diligence, u can go with the invest saver. It really depends what are your investment goals, what u want to achieve. There might be better options available other than with POSB. U can contact me on my facebook so that we can discuss further.0 comments2"
