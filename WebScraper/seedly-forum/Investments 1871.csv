1,"Kishor BhagwatLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Yes, just note that SSB is not immediately available to you, so factor in 1 month lag. It means you can keep 2 months of emergency in really liquid form, and the next 4months in SSB, and withdraw as you need every month.1 comment2"

3,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 06 Oct 2018Yeah for me, I also choose to put it in higher liquid places eg the DBS Multiplier so I can withdraw if I need it urgently.‚ÄãSSB for me is for longer term sums of money which you may not intend to touch for 5 to 10 years :) Less liquid.0 comments1"
4,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 06 Oct 2018Yes but I prefer high interest savings that is truly liquid that can take out anytime like DBS multiplier at 1.85% or more interest paid monthly 7th.‚ÄãWhile for SSB, it only pay interest 2 times a year and emergency funds needs to be truly liquid. So I prefer something more easily accessible. Furthermore , 1 year SSB interview is at 1.88% recently updated.See seedly blog post to find out more :‚Äãhttps://blog.seedly.sg/guide-investing-singapore-savings-bond-ssb-interest-rate-how-to-buy/0 comments0"
