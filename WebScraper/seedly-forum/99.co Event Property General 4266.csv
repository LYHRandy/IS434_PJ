1,"Douglas Chow, Chief Enlightenment Officer at Empower AdvisoryLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 26 May 2019Hi Douglas here. 2nd keynote speaker.A few possible reasons. Asking price not realistic for its specific location. Geylang is actualy a great city finge location but the property has to be in the better lorongs.Some lorongs are just too close to the red light lorongs and turn off many buyers. I only buy properties for my clients in the better, more wholesome parts of Geylang. They are all profitable.Other reasons could be poor property maintenance, dodgy neighbours and mechanical carparking which can be a huge turn off. I once saw a condo in Geylang where tables and chairs are thrown into the swimming pool, a frightening sight to scare off any buyer, whether for own stay or investment.You can always connect with me via https://www.facebook.com/douglas.chow.908 or simply whatsapp/sms my company 24/7 hotline @83324283 Remember, plan your finances properly, donâ€™t overstretch, do your homework and enjoy your property investment journey.
