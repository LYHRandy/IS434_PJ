GeniusAnswered on 10 Nov 2018What is your ideal retirement plan?To be able to receive a lump sum amount of money in full , or a steady stream of income coming in every month?If you wish to receive a lump sum amount of money, you could stay cash rich just by performing your own investments.If you wish to receive a steady stream of income for life, you can consider topping up into CPF SA like what Yixiong mentioned, otherwise you can consider private annuities and Supplementary Retirement Scheme to lower your income taxes.0 comments1"
2,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 10 Nov 2018Have u considered topping up your special account?
You will earned a guaranteed rate of 4%. For the first $60k in your CPF combined balance , the monies will earn an extra 1%. Since u are self-employed, u will not be near the limit yet. Thus it is worthwhile to topup to earn effective 5% return. Risk-free, regardless of market conditions.In additional u will receive tax relief for the topped up amount. Eg, your taxable income is $40k, for every dollar u earn above 40k is taxed at 7%. Therefore, if u topped up $1000 into your special account, u get $1000 tax relief, u saved 7% of $1000 = $70 tax money. Effectively have gotten 7% return on your money, in additional u will earn 4%-5% interest yearly guaranteed.Add me on my facebook if u would like to discuss further. There are another area to 'save' cost since u are getting BTO, if u are getting a HDB loan?0 comments1"
