1,"Ric Wang Poh PengLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 12 Jun 2018This weighs in deeply by your personal thoughts I feel. What are the odds of getting the CI? In my case, I feel that due to advancement in technology, scans will get better and the earlier and more curable the CI is. Also, depending on exposed you are to radiation, what food you eat, and how much you can afford to pay etc...0 comments1"

MasterAnswered on 06 Dec 2018ECI is definitely the future.https://www.moneymaverickofficial.com/posts/prioritise-early-critical-illness-insurance-life-insuranceEspecially because we live in such an advanced country with early detection and treatments. I purchased a substantial amount of ECI.ECI is actually for multiple purposes - expedited treatments/surgeries or specialized treatments, as well as income replacement, a much wider range of coverage, etc. In depth study into the CIs will show you that late stage cases are often irreversible - while ECI is not, and you should beat the crap out of it with a huge chunk of money and reimbursed medical bills so you never experience it again.You can purchase a policy strategically such that if you claim, you'll make money and if you don't claim you'll make money anyway. Every policy is designed to increase your net worth. If you have any questions about ECI, you can always drop me a message directly. I'd be happy to answer them.https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
3,"Gabriel ThamLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Jun 2018My personal opinion is early CI is too low a chance to detect.​Even with advancement in detection technology, you still need to request a targetted scan to find it.For example, if you request a scan for cancer, then you might find cancer or not. But most people will not ask for a specific scan unless they feel something wrong or under recommendation.​Most people will go for a general health check up that is not as in depth as a specific scan such as MRI or cancer detection etc.​If you are really paranoid, you can go for all possible health scans but that will cost you a bomb.0 comments0"
