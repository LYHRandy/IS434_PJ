2,"See all 3 comments Hariz Arthur Maloy03 Apr 2019You wouldn't know if the new job will give you yearly raises though. Might even out sooner than you think. Is there a possible promotion on the cards as well?Question Poster05 Apr 2019Yea promotion is definitely out. Small company, manager is still around, so they won't need another manager unless the current one leaves.
As for increment, yea this is tough to figure out. Usually HR will paint a rosy picture of bonuses and increments but I've been tricked twice to know that nothing is guaranteed...but I am asking for a much higher salary to compensate incase there is no bonus or increment"
