GeniusUpdated on 28 Jul 2019Having some credit activity with a good score would definetely help with getting a higher loan quantum but banks seldom vary the interest rate base on a better credit score.You can start building up your credit score with a credit card by always repaying your credit card bills on time and avoid applying for too many credit cards as their might view you as being credit hungry. NEVER ever overspend beyond your means / default on your credit card bills.Credit cards when used with prudence can be a very useful tool; You earn points / cashback from your spending too.https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-highest-credit-score-in-singaporehttps://www.posb.com.sg/personal/articles/my-goals/home-assets/how-to-improve-your-credit-scorehttps://www.creditbureau.com.sg/credit-score.html0 comments4"
