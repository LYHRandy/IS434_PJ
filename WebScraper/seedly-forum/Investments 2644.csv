1,"Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Hello! Whether it is a good time to invest in the stock market will depend on your risk appetite and also whether you are in need of money. If you are in need of money now, it is not a good time to invest. It is also important to know what are the invesment methods you will want to use and also how well the company you are planning to invest in is doing. Personally, i would only invest when I am confident in the company's business strategy and understand how the company works and if i have some extra money that is not need urgently. Hope this helps!0 comments0"
