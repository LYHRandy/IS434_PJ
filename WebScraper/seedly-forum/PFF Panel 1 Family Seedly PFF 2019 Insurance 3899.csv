MasterAnswered on 06 Apr 2019If you can afford, a whole life would make sense.However, in the event you are worried about insurability, yet may want an affordable 1,term is also fine. If you are OK to wait, and feels that insurability can wait, they can settle their own insurance themselves. Just help them get hospitalisation aka shield plans ISP plans. (single most important and very affordable).0 comments0"
