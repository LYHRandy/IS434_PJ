Just wondering if anyone has advice on which fund I should switch to right now?The returns on China-India fund have not been great so I'm thinking of switching.

God of WisdomAnswered on 20 Jul 2019What was your original purpose for getting the policy? Was it for protection? Or investments? Or both?I don't recommend mixing both insurance and investments in the same policy. You might want to evaluate your current situation to see if there are more cost effective solutions for your insurance portfolio, and there are definitely places such as POEMS where you can invest in funds in a more cost efficient manner. If you require a second opinion I can assist.0 comments5"
