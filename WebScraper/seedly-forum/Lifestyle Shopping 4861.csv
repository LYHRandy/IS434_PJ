RookieAnswered on 25 May 2019You can ask any of your neighbours to receive it as many of the stores do not pay any objection to that and you can also ask them to deliver at some other place but that too with some conditions, you can ask to deliver in 30km distance or something, every portal maintain some conditions to shipping so you have to know it before you make any changes. Before starting the shipping process also, by checking the estimated delivery, you can change the shipping address if you know if you are not going to be there at the given address which is possible in some sites. So, according to your availability choose the details in the site. The popular E-commerce stores like Amazon, Noon, Souq and others follow their own rules so, be aware of them. Amazon AE offers special shipping on some order which you can check at the store.0 comments1"
