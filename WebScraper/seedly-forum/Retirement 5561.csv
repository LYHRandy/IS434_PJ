1,"Lee Chun KiatLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 07 Dec 2018Make some calculations the amount of retirement funds you need for the next 45 years (assuming you live till 80 years old), then you will realize why it is not realistic (albeit possible) for such an early retirement.Things get worse if you intend to settle down, ie. getting married, 1-2 kids, etc...0 comments0"
2,"Daniel Lee, Growth Marketing Lead at SeedlyLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I don't think it matters, the age in which one retires. The younger the age, the more green-eyed people get, haha.I have some relatives that retired pretty early, at age 40+, definitely the envy of many. Are you intending to follow the movement and at some point retire early? So far, from what you've read, any cool tactics to share other than passive income streams and saving more? 2 comments0"
3,"Question Poster03 Dec 2018Yes, I intend to retire at age 35-40, but kind of going into semi-retirement mode. Maybe start up a business, work as a consultant/freelancer, write a book.

What I have read, mainly passive income streams and savings, no quick way about it. I am a big fan of REITs and P2P lending sites, which give fairly consistent returns.

Current a 22 yo student tho, so I am not sure if I am thinking too far LOLDaniel Lee04 Dec 2018Well, never say never! Keep working at it, and learn as many things as you can whilst you're still young. Don't be afraid of trying out new ways of making passive income and don't be disheartened when things don't work out! "
