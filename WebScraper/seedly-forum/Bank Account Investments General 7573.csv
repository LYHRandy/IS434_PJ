question,Bank Account Investments General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Sep 2018I am 28 a university graduate and have been working for two years. I recently came into 300k and am looking to invest. If I were to put a specific (but idealistic) goal: 1 million before I turn 35?For context: I honestly thought I would have to work really hard before I could even see 100k liquid assets by 32-34 so i immediately dismissed some options but now I am open to more opportunities so I was wondering what they may be. My job is a 9-5 that pays decently. Thanks for all your help.4 answersAnswerBump0

MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Look into getting insurance protection in place first before investing - medical / term / critical illness / total and permanent disability coverage, if you don't have this in place already. You can't buy health once it's gone. ​To address the main part of your question, to achieve another S$700,000 in 7 years is possible using a portfolio of options on stocks. With this method, it's easily a comfortable 30% per annum return on your principal. ​It's not for everyone, as there will be higher risk involved, and you will need to find someone who will teach you how to do this (so that you know what are mistakes to avoid and risk can be managed). I did a sample calculation for you via the calculator.net website based on your principal amount and the rate of return I mentioned, compounded monthly, and pasted here for you to take a look​https://www.calculator.net/interest-calculator.html?cstartingprinciple=300000&cannualaddition=0&cmonthlyaddition=0&cadditionat1=beginning&cinterestrate=30&ccompound=monthly&cyears=7&ctaxtrate=0&cinflationrate=0&printit=0&x=86&y=17#interestresults​Based on the calculation, you will achieve your target by the end of year 7, more than double over. ​I am using this method with the aim of retiring early. ​Hope this helps and all the best.0 comments0"

If single, you should be buying a house in 7 years time unless you're fine living with parents. ​Before anything, set goals, with milestones listed. Protect your wealth - Health insuranceAccumulate your wealth - InvestmentsPlan for retirement - Lower risk, longer term investments/ forced savings​As Kah Hwee has calculated, 14% per year returns is achievable, but there is definitely an amount of risk required to be taken if you can indeed achieve this. Judge how comfortable you are with taking risks. Read through the contents on the site to see where you can place your money. 0 comments0"

MasterAnswered on 19 Sep 2018Your principal is $300k.Assuming you can invest $2k a month = $24k per year.Assume interest rate is 10% annually.7 years to grow.You will end up with $835,076.44.​To end up with 1 million by 35, you'll have to have returns of 14% a year.That is pretty difficult to do haha0 comments0"
