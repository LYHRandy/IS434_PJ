1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 31 May 2018I cannot remember exactly how long it takes but from my experience, it takes a while.​First of all, you have to set up the prefunded account and get them to connect to your CDP account, which itself takes around 3 days i think.​Then the GIRO link. That is the longest. Average 1 to 2 weeks.  And it takes 3 days for the money to reflect after you have transferred the money​After which you just need to log on to your Maybank KE account, select eservices and activate the MIP. That one is quite fast though.​Lastly, just make sure you have money by the 8th of every month as this is when they will purchase the stock of your choice.​This is a very useful website to refer to: https://www.maybank-ke.com.sg/contact-us/faqs/ke-trade/0 comments1"
