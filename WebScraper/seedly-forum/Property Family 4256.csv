question,"Property Family Asked by AnonymousAsked on 14 Jul 2019Should we sell our HDB and get 1 small condo each or keep the HDB and incur ABSD for condo purchase?We r 36, & 43 and have 2 kids. Combined income abt 16k. Current HDB is in town, age 17 years. O/S loan is 200+k, we want to pay up 2 years later but that will wipe out our CPF (113k total) and cash of about 70k. We left with 150k cash.Should we get small new condo for all of us but keep the HDB? We want to leave legacy for the kids so thinking of owning 2 Pty. Buy 1 condo each can't get good ones either due to our salary.Sell off the HDB (~660k) tp get 2 condo also limited due to our income.2 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Zen BoldLevel 1. FreshieAnswered on 17 Jul 2019The cost of maintaining the mortage for two units would lead to a very high debt burden. In addition, as you have mentioned, ABSD would wipe out what little appreciation of the property prices. What I can suggest is to ensure that your kids are well off financially: you can put the amount into SRS, get the tax relief and use the amount for investments. Given the time horizon of 20 years(When you are 56 and 64 respectively), the sum of 150k can double/triple and be a nice gift to your kids. You can also proceed to sell away your HDB and gift the earnings into your child's BTO so as to enjoy a place to stay indefinately.0 comments0"
