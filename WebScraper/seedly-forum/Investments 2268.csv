1,"Yeo Enk LouiLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Hi there!In my opinion, yes perhaps it would be wise to steer clear from investing in the UK market at this juncture given the uncertainty with a ""Hard Brexit""For example, the UK will lose direct access to the EU's consumer market and all British goods would have to undergo customs procedures for entry into the EU, coupled with increased taxation and levies.These uncertainties and risks are detrimental to companies' growth and profits, which will ultimately hurt stock prices. As an investor, our aim is to mitigate this kind of risks and hence, it would be wiser to invest in say.. the US/China market (if you are looking to invest on other country's exchange)0 comments0"
