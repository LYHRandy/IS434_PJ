1,"SShieleenLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 20 Aug 2019Definitely share the plan you have. It affect the job as studies require commitment, time & effort (e.g. think about taking leave for exams etc). You’re going to juggle between F/T job and P/T studies after all. Also, the P/T studies better be relevant to the job. Else, please be prepared to answer why you’re applying the job if the course is not relevant / close to the job applied. You may even check with HR on the training support and culture of the company so you might be eligible for company-sponsorship or subsidy for the P/T studies! You will also want to know how supportive the company is for your own career development wise. So why not?3 comments1"
2,"See all 3 comments SShieleen09 Jul 2019Hard to determine as it depends on the company culture. But likely yes they will judge. Business is rather general and it shouldn’t be a problem as it compliment current skills set. If you can juggle between studies and work, then go ahead!Zach Howe20 Aug 2019Thank You!"
3,"WnkLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 08 Jul 2019It may not be mandatory, unless the interviewer asks you specifically if you have any such plans! I wouldn’t say that it must be during round 2 that you need to raise it up, so you have to play by ear. Moreover, I do not see that it will necessarily pull down your chances in the event that you do bring it up. Employers hire not just for skill set, but also for your attitude. An avid learner is definitely one to hire!Some of the questions you can ask is if there are any training programs available for employees or if there are any study grants available.Good luck!0 comments0"
