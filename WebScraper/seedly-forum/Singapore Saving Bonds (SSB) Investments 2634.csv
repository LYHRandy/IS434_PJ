1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 26 Feb 2019Its getting abit lower. Maybe you can put 50% inside first. Then wait for returns to go up before putting more. If your money is just sitting there earning low interest, i think invest some right now would be better. Or you can look at high interest savings account.0 comments0"
