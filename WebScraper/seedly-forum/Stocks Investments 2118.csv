1,"Alvin TanLevel 2. RookieAnswered on 11 Mar 2019It is not true that companies share price always tank post IPOs.As with all other forms of investments, IPOs should be classified as a product on its own, carrying its own set of unique risks that mainly stems from its non-listed history. Investors that participate in IPOs typically do analysis comparing the company in question to peers (comparable analysis), fundamental valuation methods (eg DCF) are also used. More often than not, a combination of valuation methodologies are used to arrive at a view on valuation and forecast earnings which an institutional investor may use to decide upon whether to participate in the IPO or not. If a company does a good job in promoting itself ahead of IPO, investors may accord them the benefit of the doubt and go with more aggressive forecasts and valuation. If stock price of company falls post IPO, it can be due to a multitude of factors: over-exuberance for the company and sector, over promising at the stage of IPO and then not delivering as seen when newly listed companies miss expectations, allocation to wrong class of investors at the time of IPO eg overallocation to HNI individuals for a reit IPO, stuffing stock down hedge funds etc etc. Even post listing market conditions play an important role eg any listing in 4Q last year would have undoubtedly suffered because of the market volatility that we saw during that time.End of the day it’s not as straightforward as a single explanatory factor. It’s always a combination of circumstances that brings an IPO together or causes it to tank post listing.0 comments2"

ProdigyAnswered on 11 Mar 2019This is the difference between private market pricing vs public market.When private, the final investors (usually PE) private equity guys get in on a slightly discounted price and they exit when the prices are at IPO level.After that, in the open market, they trade at the real value set by demand and supply (by the retail investors)Often times, the IPO prices are inflated and most of the stockholders would try to sell majority of their stake.0 comments1"

As such IPOs trade positively only for a few days after the IPO before the prices start to fall drastically. Reasons for the fall is the selloff that results from the overvaluation of the stock. After going public, when the companies performance do not match up to its IPO price, investors start to sell their stocks driving prices down. Flipping is also common in IPOs, where investors trade IPOs speculatively.0 comments1"

In fact, other than tank, share prices can actually shoot up because investors who did not get involved in the IPO because of some oversubscribtion. Over here, demand would exceed supply and your share prices will go up.If your are referring to the ""tank"" period, maybe this could be after the lock-up period where the investors pre-IPO can finally sell off their shares. This could include senior management, employees, private equity firms and venture capitalists who might be eager to sell-off their shares and cash out. This is especially through for the PEs and VCs because that is their big return they are looking for. (This lock up period exsists because the firm does not want investors to have the impression that the original investors believe that the firm is over-valued)An overestimation or overvaluation of the stocks also can cause the stocks to be ""underbought"", what happens here is that the underwriting banks might come in and buy up the shares to save face.Companies typically want their share prices to be higher, before letting them them slide down, so at least investors won't get a first ""bad"" impression. So this might be another reason why share prices might fall.0 comments0"
5,"Richard Woon Tian JunLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 12 Mar 2019Sometimes firm share prices after IPOs tank because people treat IPOs as speculative bets, and usually are not in it for the long term growth prospects of the firm. That's why after the ""lock down"" period expires, where these IPO investors are not allowed to trade their shares, these speculative investors will take profit and exit their investments immediately since they are just in it for the Short term momentum and inflated demand because of the IPO craze nowadays.It is almost inevitable that there will be some selling pressures right after the lock down, but if you are in it for the long run, and the firm's business model is solid, you will see the prices surge back up and in fact surpass initial prices with continued strong growth.0 comments0"
