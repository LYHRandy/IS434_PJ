1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 05 Jun 2019Yes I did. With the free delivery only for Redmart, I wouldn't go for it. It's possible to hit free delivery in any case, if you purchase beyond a certain amount. And that's what I use online groceries for - to buy toiletries in bulk such that I can hit the free shipping and not have to lug 60 toilets rolls home. My mum does ask me if I'm preparing for the war though, when she sees the large stash of toilet rolls in the store room ðŸ˜‚0 comments2"
