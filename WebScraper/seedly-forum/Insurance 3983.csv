As an FA who offers multiple companies, I've done a comparison table of whole life+early ci across the board. Each has its pros and cons and have benefits depending on your profile. Prices can also defer from age, especially between the early 40s group and the late 20s group. The price also depends on what kind of multiplier you want. A $50,000 x 3 is cheaper than a $75,000 x 2, but you'll have substantially less of a claim after 70 as well as lower cash values, which can be pretty important once you see the difference in numbers. Do drop me a PM and we can talk about this properly. https://www.facebook.com/luke.ho.540 comments0"
