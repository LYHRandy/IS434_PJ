1,"Loh Tat Tian, 2nd Hand Insurance Broker / EX-FA at Singapore Insurance Value FindingLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 04 Jan 2019There have been cases of ""wet weather"" denied claim by Ntuc. So imho, no go. This insurance plan also has a cap of $10 for surge. They may also price it to earn, so unless you are a really frequent traveller and do not mind some claims being denied, I would say it's not worth the premium 0 comments0"
