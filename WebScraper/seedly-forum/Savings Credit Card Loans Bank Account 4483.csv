question,"Savings Credit Card Loans Bank Account Asked by AnonymousAsked on 04 Sep 2019Have anyone banked or used the services from Maybank? If so what are your experiences with the bank?Hi, I am wondering if any of yall had banked with Maybank before. Curious to find out exactly what the bank is good at or known for since they provide a good range of services - loans, insurances, savings, investments - but oddly enough isn't that popular or prevalent in Singapore itself. Anyone can share their experiences banking with Maybank? Thank you! :)2 answersAnswerBump0"

1,"Aik KaiLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 10 Sep 2019I once owned a Maybank savings account but I closed it. Here are my 2 cents:1) Maybank has a limited presence here as their focus is in Malaysia. Fighting the big 3 (DBS, UOB, OCBC) head-on is not their strategy but they are here to fight for a share of the pie2) To be honest, to a normal man on the street, they are no different from any other bank. Thye have branches, they have ATMs, they offer iBanking. It all boils down to whether their branches and/or ATMs are convenient to you in terms of location.3) ATMS a bit outdated. Think of their ATMs as one generation behind DBS. They get the job done. Like, everyone else is running windows 10 they still at windows 7.4) The same goes for their iBanking. It makes you wonder if the security is tight or not sometimes.5) Products are so-so. I closed my account simply because my needs have changed and DBS products are more suited for my needs.Overall, okay okay. Nothing negative in the 2 plus years I bank with them but nothing fantastic to shout about.2 comments2"
2,"Question Poster09 Sep 2019Can i ask are there instances where they screwed up anything and if so how did they respond or recover from their mistake?Aik Kai10 Sep 2019Woah. Unfortunately, no. They didn't screw up anything cause I am those self independent user. You know, like I open account liao then i forgot about it unless they send me letter or something.

My experience with their branch staff was positive though. I guess because they don't need to handle big crowds so they are very friendly and genuine."

Grand MasterAnswered on 05 Sep 2019TLDR version; Its an okay bank. nothing bad, nothing special too.I have been using Maybank Corporate account and also their personal saving accounts for years.It has been okay even though they have a lack of ATMs and branches compared to the local banks. This is because I manage to do 99% of the transactions online.The internet makes it easier.The only issue is when I have local bank cheques to deposit into my corporate account, finding them is slightly more difficult than any local bank.0 comments1"
