1,"Brandan Chen, Financial Planner at Manulife SingaporeLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Well, the positive thing is that you have identified your current situation. Limited knowledge means that you should gain more of it through books, courses, articles, videos and more.For starters, perhaps your can read up more from seedly to get a basic grasp of what investment and risk are. Start off with reading about ETFs, Reits, Bonds which Seedly has compiled over the past few months.Once done, set aside a portion of your money that you can afford to lose and take the first step (""plunge"")1 comment2"
2,"Eric Chia16 Aug 2018Just to add on to what Brandan wrote, there's no right time to start investing,  but always invest with the money you have excess of (or money that you do not have immediate use for). Start with something small that you'll not have worries over losing the capital. 
 Set a goal for your investment, track your gains and losses to better learn from the experience. "
3,"Leong Wen Fong, Economics and Management at University of LondonLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 Aug 2018A lot of people who are new to investments ask this question. If you want to find out practical tips and lessons on how to invest, there are many reviews on financial courses here​https://seedly.sg/reviews/investment-courses​There is also paper trading, which is trading virtual stock, as a simulation. However, many of the members feedback that all the practise in the world can't prepare you for the real thing, because the stakes are real, and the emotions are higher.Start small, so that the losses don't hit you too hard, and don't be too greedy.​Hope this helps somewhat!0 comments0"
