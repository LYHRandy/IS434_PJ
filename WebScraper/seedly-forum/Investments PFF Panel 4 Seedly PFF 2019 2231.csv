1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 13 Mar 2019I started off setting aside at least 50% of my salary from the time I got my first paycheck and it is possible once you determine the kind of lifestyle you need and it's relating budget. It works for me - my aim was to hit six figure savings by 25, and also to buy freehold property by that age. I missed by target for property buying by one year (i was 26 then).Bottom line is - it always helps to have a monthly goal!0 comments1"
