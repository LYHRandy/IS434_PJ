1,"Angeline TeoLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 15 Sep 2019If you are Beijing and you have Shenzhen, Shanghai and tons of coastal cities, what would you do?Invest in them like crazy and make them the next important capital gateways of the world.Hong Kong has no manufacturing, and only the service industry like tourism, finances. Take away the attractiveness of the banks, the UHNW banking, the stock exchanges, what do they have left?Perhaps Hong Kong will fight hard in the next few decades to continue to be a strong capital market, after all, they are the only Chinese city to enjoy special rights and special capital/tax treatment. And Hong Kong people are strong fighters. So I believe they will fight hard and survive.But I know for sure, Shenzhen and Shanghai are going to have huge support from the political masters.0 comments0"
