1,"Cheryl Teng Sze HuiLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 Jun 2019My partner and I both have our own DBS Multiplier account and also a joint account. The joint account is a pass-through account for us to hit a higher tier. So our salary is credited to our joint account first.  With salary crediting, investing and also credit card (DBS live fresh expenses), we are getting 2.2% interest for first $50k which I think is pretty decent for a savings account!   Credit Card no min spend too, so you can still maximise savings with other cards where applicable.0 comments8"

ProdigyUpdated on 09 Jun 2019Hi there,Great question as Iâ€™m about to embark on this journey as well!Was doing some research and I've shortlisted the top 3 savings accounts you can consider that should provide you with the highest attainable interest rate. Some honourable mentions are: UOB One account, DBS Multiplier account, POSB SAYE account and Standard Chartered BonusSaver accounta) Maybank's Save Up ProgrammeIf you're choosing based on the highest base interest rate, then Maybank's Save Up Programme will be the best for you at 0.3125%.What's good about Maybank's Save Up Programme is that to qualify for their bonus interest you have the flexibility to choose at least 1 out of their 9 products and services (max 3). The most common and attainable products/services are Salary crediting and Credit card spend (usually just $500).These are some of the ways that banks attempt to upsell and cross-sell their products. Attracting consumers with higher savings account interest rate if they are able to utilise more products and services.Source: https://info.maybank2u.com.sg/saveup/#productb) OCBC's 360 AccountThough their base interest is rather low at 0.05%, however, you will get to earn higher bonus interest if you are able to use three of their products and services (Salary crediting, Credit card spend and Monthly increase of your account balance). What's great about OCBC's 360 Account is that you will earn even more interest with each product and services after your first $35,000.Source: https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/accounts/360-account.htmlc) Bank of China (Boc) SmartSaverIf you are able to obtain the max bonus interest and the base interest, you will be able to earn up to 3.55% of interest. What's special about BoC SmartSaver is that you get to enjoy 1% base interest if your account balance is above $60,000. This is good as your bonus interest is capped at $60,000. To enjoy the 1% base interest, you will have to fulfil at least one of these three criteria, Salary crediting, Credit card spend or payment.Source: http://www.bankofchina.com/sg/pbservice/pb1/201611/t20161130_8271280.htmlDo note that you can use Seedly's savings account calculator to find out which service provider is best suited for you.

Grand MasterUpdated on 10 Jun 2019A lot of women will agree with me on this (including my wife)The best joint account is one in the wife's name. :P(My money is her money. Her money is.... her money)Jokes aside, my wife is more diligent and careful with our money than me. The only thing is she is not savvy abt investments and prefer to be cautious while I am the risk taker, and my track records have shown high-risk-return is still better. Sooo all my money is in her bank account, but whenever i have investment opportunities, I will ask her for permission to use.. ""our money"".0 comments3"

Only thing which kinda sucks is the UI and website... other than that works well like any other bank account!0 comments2"
