question,"Investments Robo-Advisors Stashaway Asked by AnonymousAsked on 13 May 2019Hi Stashaway users, looking at the 3 highest risk profile portfolios 26%, 30% and 36% risk index. Recommendations? Compared to say, a pure S&P500 Etf, are these still considered riskier investments given they are diversified through a few other ETFs. Other info: thinking of DCA a few hundred each month, and will buy SGS Bonds to diversify (Stashaway 60%, bonds 40%). Looking at LT growth >7years. Thanks :-)1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019I'm on highest 36% risk index. It is higher risk compare to just pure S&P 500 ETF or index rather. After all this SA profile is on consumer discretionary and tech select sector SPDR funds, vanguard small cap growth / REITS ETF, Ishare MSCI all county ex Japan and Barclays convertible security and SPDR gold trust. It still feels like a fund manager actively manages based on their ERAA. I think if you have access to better S&P500 ETF, It would be a better overall than overdiversify on SA profile for long term growth.4 comments0"
