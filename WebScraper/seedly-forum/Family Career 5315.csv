However, I would say that generally a degree gives you a certain level of safety net that a diploma would not usually offer.Also, it's best that you do it now, whil you still have the time and finances to study. Wanting to upgrade yourself later in life can feel harder than it actually sounds.0 comments1"

In my opinion, having a degree opens a lot of doors for you. Your salary increases much faster. Education is a worthy investment.0 comments1"

ProdigyAnswered on 17 Dec 2018On my personal experience, no you should not.Because in today's context, a degree can pay more on starting salary and long term wise it is definietely worth it.On average, it takes 3-5 years to breakeven. I shall not do the maths here but that's the general average you are looking at.If you are cash-tight, do something that can earn money. I started Internship on my University year 1 and the company hired me to continue my internship job scope on a global level. On average monthly I can earn $1k+ , not alot, but enough to cover all my expenses without asking for money from parents. On overseas assignment months I can earn $2-3k including overseas allowance.In conclusion, do go for degree studies, you will ease his burden for sure!0 comments1"

Then u can give your dad and family a much better life later. You can try taking some part time work or give tuition so that at least u can provide your own pocket money.Jiayou! 0 comments1"
