God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019If you have zero background in investing, you have to decide first if you're planning to learn a lot and then DIY your investment.If you're not going to DIY, you can instead purchase a financial product. You can easily set up a portfolio using a Robo Advisor or a Financial Advisor. But still make sure that you know enough to understand and not go in blindly. Please also note that if you don't understand what you're investing in and why, you may make the common mistake of selling low when markets aren't in your favour.I would suggest that you start building a portfolio that pays some dividends immediately and also a portion of it purely for long term capital gain. As a single with no dependents and liabilities, you have the chance to build financial independence and retire a little bit more everyday until you build enough regular streams of income to replace your need to work.2 comments3"

My rationale was that I wanted to learn for myself, instead of relying on others to invest on my behalf. It's great that you do not have the liability - which really gives you more flexibility with your savings.0 comments1"
