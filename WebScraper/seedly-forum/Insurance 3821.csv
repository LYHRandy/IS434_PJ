question,"Insurance Asked by AnonymousAsked on 08 May 2019Hi could someone give me some advice on when (which age range) MINDEF insurance by AVIVA will not be cost viable anymore?I understand that from a certain age band – MINDEF Insurance by Aviva will no longer be cost viable. Hence, can you advise at which age band will it be no longer cost effective?For Early CIs/CIs coverage – I also hear that it is not as comprehensive, can anyone advise as well?

God of WisdomUpdated on 07 Jun 2019The policies are not cost effective after age 65.The Living Care Plus is not comprehensive as it covers only 10 early CI conditions while other private policies can cover up to 100+. The Living Care is fine. Just note that the rider premiums are not level and increase by age band, while a private policy will have level premiums and won't change as you age.2 comments3"

Meaning to say I could hold the policies till 65 yo? I know that the group term life is the cheapest in the market. Living Care Plus I can terminate now? Thanks!Hariz Arthur Maloy09 May 2019Woah wait wait. Yes you can hold them to 65. :) But go get yourself a private policy first before cancelling anything. And even after that, you can still hold it for extra cover because it's really very cheap. Treat it as a bonus if you can afford it."

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Aviva Mindef insurance is cost effective as follows from my calculations1) Death - Anytime you can buy and by age 66 there is a steep increase. So if you plan to have coverage after 65, do compare private insurance cost with this.I would urge you to get private insurance for death first, then top up with group term because the opportunity cost to top up is cheaper for Aviva Mindef compared to private.2) CI - most likely age 30, because private CI plans may be slightly more expensive at the start, but levelled. Aviva Mindef has a tiered system and cost more each group band till 65.3) ECI - not worth to get it totally, can skip it (i cancelled mine).2 comments1"
4,"Question Poster21 May 2019You mean to say:
- Get how much base coverage for death via private before topping up with Aviva MINDEF?
- CI at most hold until 30?
- ECI refers to Living Care or Living Care Plus?Loh Tat Tian22 May 2019I mean to say, try to get a personal death insurance first. Personal death allows nomination and also is not subjected to group insurance terms. Once the premium is more expensive than Aviva Mindef insurance, get from Aviva. For CI, if you are pass 30, it may be cheaper to buy term CI instead of Aviva Mindef, (saying you buy CI Coverage up to 65.) you do not stop buying CI once you bought from Aviva Mindef. - ECI = living care plus. - CI is living care"
