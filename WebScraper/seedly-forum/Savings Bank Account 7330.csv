1,YCYewFong ChuaLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 18 Aug 2019Would recommend using CIMB FastSaver instead of OCBC 360 account. The reasons are as follows: 1) OCBC requires you to credit your salary of at least S$2000 through GIRO. (Which your company provide your salary as cheque will not meet the requirement)2) You need to increase your account balance by S$500 compared to the previous month then you are entitled to the Step-Up bonus. 3) If you are looking for pure saving without applying any credit card to spend at least S$500 to hit the minimum requirement. Then CIMB FastSaver is the right one to choose.

Citibank Maxigain, if you have 70k min and can do a 1 dollar top up at least every month is better! Do correct me if I’m wrong because that’s what I saw on their calculator. Singapore Saving Bonds! Provided the interests is good too. Safe!0 comments0"
