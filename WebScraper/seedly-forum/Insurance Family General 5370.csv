question,"Insurance Family General Asked by AnonymousAsked on 19 Sep 2018I’ve read that it is a requirement by MOM to get medical insurance to cover your confinement lady for the duration that she’s going to look after your baby. Is it true and anybody with experience?If it is indeed a requirement, how do I go about doing it if the agency that I’ve employed my confinement nanny does not do it for me? Which insurance company should I look out for? Thanks!3 answersAnswerBump0"

MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Some employment agency will provide the services of getting the workmedic insurance by referring you to an agent or you can go direct to NTUC INCOME and apply it over the counter.The correct term is confinement nanny and the correct permit is ""work permit"" that comes with a daily levy once approved.you can get the break down with the below link:

As for local, it might be a str forward cash tx and usually employer does not have to buy insurance for them since is a cash tx deal.if the local is sick or MC, ur contact of service will cover you if is fixed cash tx deal, if u do not have a contract of service, u might risk be taken to task for not paying for medical claim or hospital claim from the local confinement nanny.Hope my reply helps.If you feel this reply have Quality, please upvote and check other Quality Reply.https://seedly.sg/profile/a-kenichi-xiThank you.2 comments2"

3,"Lee JiahuiLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 26 Sep 2018I checked with NTUC, Etiqa, FWD, InsureDIY, Liberty, ... All don't have policy for confinement nanny, only have maid insurance. I asked MOM, they told me to contact Insured Asia, so called them to check, they said they have a $140 plan for 1 yr just for MOM but they don't publish online, underwritten by Ergo. The plan is tied to the work permit so you hire a few weeks but still pay the 1 yr price. If suay change nanny then you need to pay for another plan cos cannot transfer. Nanny also cannot keep the plan for 1 yr to reap benefits cos you are not employer for 1 yr.0 comments1"

Min $15k of insurance be it local or foreign confinement lady. ​I'm sure the insurance agent here will share how / where to get. Alternatively, you can also just check all the insurance company website for more information. ​Read more about confinement lady , the requirments / rules and regulations etc here:https://blog.moneysmart.sg/family/confinement-nanny-singapore-cost/​if you’re not willing to fork out thousands of dollars, or just don’t like the idea of having some random auntie in the house?  Some hospitals, clinics and businesses can deliver confinement food to your doorstep, supposedly prepared in accordance with TCM principles. Examples include Tian Wei Signature and Thomson Medical Centre.​This is of course only the food and you will still need hubby to do the duty roaster (ask him to apply for the 2 weeks paternity leave given by government) and also he can share 4 weeks of your 16 weeks of your government paid maternity leave to help out. ​My friend's husband finds recipe and cook the maternity meals himself and use all the leave above + his annual leave to save $$$ and care for his wife / baby ! :) ​Paternity leave info: https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/leave/paternity-leaveSharing your maternity leave info: https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/leave/shared-parental-leave​To find more sources for confinement lady, you can joing those FB mother groups or : https://singaporemotherhood.com/forum/threads/confinement-nanny-recommendation.221599/​0 comments1"
