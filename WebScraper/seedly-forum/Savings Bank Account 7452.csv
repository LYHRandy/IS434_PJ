WonderkidAnswered on 22 Mar 2019Off-hand I would say that SDIC has not had to pay out since it's inception as I do not know of any incidences where banks/insurers have failed to payout to their clients in Singapore due to default.With effect from 1 April 2019, the limit has increased to $75,000https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/10/understanding-deposit-insurance0 comments0"

7,"Herbert SidikLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 20 Nov 2018Invest that money in REITs or ETFs (Straits Times Index or S&P500) and easily get about 7-9% (safer, passive option). Also, if you're capable of evaluating good & cheap companies, Stocks can cross over 10%.Why put that money in a fixed deposit for the bank to give you only 2% when they are using your frozen amount to invest for waaaay higher returns?0 comments0"
