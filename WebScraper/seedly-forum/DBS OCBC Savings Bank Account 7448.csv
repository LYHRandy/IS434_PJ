WizardAnswered on 01 Apr 2019Your plan is right, have 1 a/c  for expenses and 1 for savings / super short term emergency / investment a/c  (eg. DBS multiplier if you can get the higher interest like 2.%). CIMB for emergency only get 1%, you can do a bond ladder with SSB at higher 1.95% (currently for a month). So when you need $ for emergency, use the super short term emergency account. If you need larger amount of $ for emergency and can wait for months, the bond ladder would have help balance both interest and emergency cash usage. See this on how to apply Bond Ladder:
