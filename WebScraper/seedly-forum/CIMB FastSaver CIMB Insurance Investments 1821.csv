1,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 04 Apr 2019Quite fuss-free as it has no conditions such as salary creditting and minimum spending attached to it! What I do is to use CIMB Fastsaver for the remaining money, after using other higher i/r accounts like Citi MaxiGain and Standard Charted Bonus Saver accounts.0 comments1"

If you have moeny to spare, you might want to consider putting them into Singapore Savings Bond or Fixed Deposits. They offer returns higher than 1% :)​You can check out this article written by Seedly: https://blog.seedly.sg/guide-investing-singapore-savings-bond-ssb-interest-rate-how-to-buy/0 comments1"

That being said, 1% interest is rather low and there are very few atm machines for you to draw cash. Their internet banking website is not as user friendly as other banks as well.0 comments0"
