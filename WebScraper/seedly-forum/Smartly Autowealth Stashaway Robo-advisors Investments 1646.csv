3,"Shaun GohLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Updated Apr 2019Stashaway: Started in Oct 2017 with 60/40 portfolio on monthly contributions. Switched to 80+ equity during the trade war & SGD returns shot up to 11% (from 3 - 4% previously) Question: Hypothetically if i knew a market crash would come in a month or so, would it be wise to lower my risk profile OR maintain risk profile and continue (or even pump) DCA-ing. Is it possible for the portfolio to get wiped permanently (due to some weird rebalancing) ?2 comments4"
4,"summer14 Apr 2019Hi Shaun, may I know what is DCA?Shaun Goh15 Apr 2019Dollar cost averaging.. Investing the same amount at fixed intervals (e.g. Monthly, quarterly, yearly) instead of trying to time the best time to invest. The points at which you buy high and low (hopefully) averages out over the long term."
5,He Jian HongLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019 I've been using for almost a year... all the while hardly went above 4%... after i set the new risk level... within a month went up to 11%... I should be happy since its earning me moolah but somewhere Im afraid... what goes up fast and hard also comes down fast and hard... For example... Cryptos...STASHAWAY 3 comments4
6,"See all 3 comments Shaun Goh10 Apr 2019If you expected a stock market crash, will you switch to a lower risk portfolio (at least until it recovers)? Only con is if you continued to put money in, you wouldn't be taking advantage of the weakness.He Jian Hong11 Apr 2019Shaun Goh -> No, I set it to the highest risk possible and leave it as it is. Last year there was a serious dip to -20% over... but just ignore and hold and keep doing DCA... right now its back to +11% again..."

I seem to be barely hanging in there ðŸ˜‚ hopefully given a longer period of time I might get better returns! My risk level was level 3, which is the balanced portfolio 60-40 if I'm not wrong. 1 comment2"
