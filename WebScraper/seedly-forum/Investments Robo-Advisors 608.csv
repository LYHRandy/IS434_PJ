1,"Victor Lye, Founder & CEO at SquirrelSaveLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 01 Sep 2019Understand your anxiety. One lesson I have learnt the hard way, and which was already shared by many before me, is that we should not time the market.If you want to speculate, bet or gamble, by all means, timing the market is one technique. But true investing starts by knowing your own risk profile and making sure that your mix of underlying assets results in a risk that matches your own profile. In all my years of investing as a professional wealth manager, I realise that I am also subject to the same problem - just as my clients are.If you look at most crashes and corrections in the markets, it would be a stroke of luck, not skill, to consistently navigate every drop in the market. Same for the bull runs.Data suggests that most corrections and crashes were done within a span of 2-3 years. The upturns in the markets tend to be longer. Truth is, we can't time these turning points well as humans due to our emotions.So if you want to invest, take at least a 1-3 year time horizon, know your risk appetite and start early. There is never a right time to start but start early. In fact, I believe even children should start investing, simply because they have a long runway and do not need the money until they grow up.Since you can invest a small amount monthly, you can start now and ride the ups and downs. Robos that allow you to start with small amounts are welcome investment methods which were not available in the past. Traditional investments required minimum investments and were not as efficiently diversified. So choose a Robo that is global and manages downside risk. For these reasons. I created SquirrelSave. Of course, every Robo has its pros and cons. So take your pick according to your comfort. All the best!0 comments5"

We will only know the results after a long long long time. i write about it in my blog http://www.engboonhow.com/robo-investing-july-2019-update/By the way, ""impending recession"" sounds untrue. Not sure where you get the info. Anyway, if you do robo investing, you would most likely be very happy when the market drops. As you will be able to buy more, using the same amount.2 comments4"

4,"Jules BordatLevel 2. RookieUpdated on 23 Jul 2019Yes, yes and yes. If you goal is long-term growth, then don't try to time the market. Simply invest systematically and dollar or value-cost average to smoothen the impact of your entry points. As easy as this.If you had a sizeable amount to invest, you could divide it in smaller amounts across time.Also see this amazing reddit post comparing the performance of 3 different investors: 1 that does not time the market and invest consistently across time, 1 that invests only at the lowest entry points and another one at the highest entry points: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/c02ml4/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute/1 comment3"

6,Kenneth ChanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 03 Aug 2019The best time to invest into robo is when you are ready. It’s basically DCA so there is no market timing involved.0 comments1
7,"Yu Ming JinLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 03 Aug 2019DYODD, but it might be ideal to ""time"" the market. That is, DCA when the market has sunk by a considerable amount during the recession, if it ever happens.0 comments0"
