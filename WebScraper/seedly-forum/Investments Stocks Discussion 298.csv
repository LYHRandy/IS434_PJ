God of WisdomAnswered 4d agoHi anon,We don't know when the market peak is, or if it is even already past. Having said that, you can allocate a 1/3 1/3 1/3 strategy.Start with 1/3 of your funds, go into the market. Take 1/3 of your funds and spread them over 1-2 years of DCA. And the last 1/3 can be used as a 'warchest' for market opportunities.Remember, time in the market is far more important than timing the market. So don't time the market. Just go in. The results will show themselves in time.For more information, do look at a previous question I answered here: https://seedly.sg/questions/is-it-really-true-if-you-do-dollar-cost-averaging-time-in-market-outweighs-timing-the-market0 comments6"

God of WisdomAnswered 4d agoIf you're worried about entering at too high of a peak, then you might want to invest a quarter of your money per quarter. Transaction costs of a 7.5k investment should be low enough to be negligible.It'll give you some confidence that you are dipping your feet, but not too shallow to not feel the water, and not deep enough for you to drown if markets go south. All the best!0 comments3"
3,"Luke Ho, Kick-Ass Financial Services Consultant at Trillion Financial PlannersLevel 6. MasterAnswered 4d agoOverwhelmingly, you don't balance it. DCA works in very short periods.Even though the annualized yield was smaller on paper, the absolute return was higher. So if your time horizon is long (say, 20 years), you should invest it entirely regardless of the market cycle.There is an analysis here:
