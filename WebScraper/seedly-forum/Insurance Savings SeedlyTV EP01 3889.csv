WizardAnswered on 16 May 2019As with all equity related products, yes if you are selling below what you bought at.Which is why it's important to have liquidity. When markets tank and things are in the red in the short term, you do not want to be in a position where you feel like you are forced to sell; you want to be able to hold it for the long term and get a positive return in the long run.0 comments1"

God of WisdomAnswered on 08 Apr 2019You only lose money when you sell and realize your losses. If you stay invested in equities (and I'm assuming that when you mean ETF, you're referring to an equity ETF) for the long run (more than 10 years), there's a high probability (of about 60+%) that you will have a positive return.Now, if you're worried about short term capital loss, and really can't stand volatility, it's better you look at capital guaranteed products such as bonds or insurance products to complement your overall portfolio. But you need to know if you're able to take that risk that equity inherently has. Because if you need equity like returns to reach your goals, you need to take equity like risk. If you can't or really unable to, then you'll have to change your goals. There are no two ways about it.0 comments0"
