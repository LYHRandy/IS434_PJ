1,"Clarence Chua, Financial Planning Specialist at Prudential Assurance SingaporeTop Contributor (Sep)Level 7. Grand MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Personally, I will advise to pay a portion of it with cash, as CPF is a really good financial instrument for retirement.
Giving 3.5% for your first 20k in OA and 2.5% subsequently. Taking money out of your CPF, means you will lose the 2.5 or 3.5% of interests and on top of that you are also paying your loan interests of 2.6% (assuming one took a load from HDB) so thats is like a -5%. But not everyone can afford to pay with cash and also some may earn more than enough for CPF hence its good for them to split as they have surplus from their CPF. (Everyone has a different number so its good to do your maths before deciding on the % split)6 comments4"

Previously I used 5% cash and 5% cpf for my initial 10%. I think I agree with you and I'm thinking of using my cpf as my bond portfolio and thus I transferred most of my oa to sa.Clarence Chua22 Apr 2019It’s heartening to see more Singaporeans like yourself making good use of the Financial Instrument we have!

I wish you the best of luck and pray your wealth grow steadily!"
