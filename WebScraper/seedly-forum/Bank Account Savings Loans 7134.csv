WizardAnswered on 13 May 2019Strength of DBS Multiplier overs the other 2 lies with easy to meet spending criteria to earn the interest for salaried workers.  As long as the 1 member of the couple credit salary in their own DBS account, plus with only credit card spending even just $1 (Compare to the need to charge $500 on OCBC/UOB CC) , that fulfills the criteria to get higher bonus interest to the couple's joined DBS Multiplier account. Applying SSB Bond ladder qualifies for another transaction type and hence get higher tier of bonus interest. See couple case example:

http://investmentmoats.com/money/boosted-dbs-multiplier/ *Since only need the higher salary of the 2 credit salary to DBS multiplier, the other member of the couple can remains in OCBC 360/UOB One and combine your couple spendings / charges on the one with OCBC 360/UOB One to meet the monthly $500 cc spend to continue to enjoy higher interest. Splitting funds / liquid savings into a few higher savings basket. Cheers :)0 comments0"
