1,"Nicholes Wong, Diploma in Business Management at Nanyang PolytechnicLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 02 Mar 2019If you buy early life insurance, it will be cheaper through out. Hospitalization insurance is important so that you dont have to pay for all the hospital fees. If you do not have it, you would have to pay with your savings, investments or lend from your parents. Everyone should get hospitalization insurance as soon as possible.0 comments0"
