1,"Yong Kah HweeLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 19 Oct 2018There's actually an app called Honeydue that you can use. You and your spouse can both use it to track finances, and you'll be able to see what your spouse keys in anytime. It's not available in Singapore, but if you're using an Android device you should know what you can do ;)0 comments1"
