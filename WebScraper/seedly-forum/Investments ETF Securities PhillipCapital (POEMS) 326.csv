God of WisdomAnswered on 07 Jul 2019Besides what Hariz has mentioned regarding the Infinity US 500 UT, you can also directly buy the vanguard S&P 500 ETF on the NASDAQ exchange on POEMS, although you will have to pay brokerage fees for that as it is an ETF and not a UT. Please don't buy the one traded on SGX as the volume is really bad and you will have a liquidity problem.0 comments5"

3,"Jonathan Chia Guangrong, Fund Manager at JCG FundLevel 6. MasterAnswered 2w agoIf you really want to buy into the S&P500, consider using an ETF instead of a unit trust due to lower fees especially if you hold long term. Do consider brokerages like Td Ameritrade or interactive brokers instead of any local brokers as the comm fees charged are very high.0 comments0"
