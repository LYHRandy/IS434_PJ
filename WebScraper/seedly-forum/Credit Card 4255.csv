WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Haha whoa nope... this is sort of trying to fraud the system.Your cashback will get invalidated.Hence most cashback sites are smart. They will actually hold off giving you the cashback until the agency (eg Agoda or Booking) has verified that you paid them. It's only fair! I cancelled my hotels a few times before (due to family reasons) and thus, the cashback also got invalidated :)1 comment1"

4,"Yixiong ChangLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 23 Nov 2018It is usually worth it. Because usually overseas hotels booking will be charged in their currency. You will lose out in currency exchange and forex fee(separate admin charge by some banks). They add up to a few percent. That can negate any benefits u get from your cashback (if u are just depending on this purchase). On top of the whatever hassle. Dont forget the refunds from the hotels will take quite some time, so u will have to pay your creditcard bills first.My experience with the bookings sites. Typically the hotels booking that allows free cancellation do not charge your card at the time of booking. Those that charge immediately are those that don't offer cancellation.But there could be some that offers to charge now, and offer the refund later when u cancel. But watch out for administration fees. That said, u will get your cashback or whatever with your creditcard, as long there is actual charge on the card. If there is refund in subsequent month, u will just get a credit on your credit card bill. 0 comments0"
