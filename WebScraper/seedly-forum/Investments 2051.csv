WizardAnswered on 24 Mar 2019Grab is still a privately-held company, so that means that the opportunity to invest in Grab now, at a $14bn valuation as of its Series H round from Softbank, is likely not available to retail investors right now. That said, if you knew the Grab founders when it started, and put in money as an angel investor when it was still starting up, that would have been a different story ;)0 comments2"
