2,"Serene Toh20 May 2019Out of curiosity, what if you do badly for your investment? Do you have to Top it up with interest when you sell your investments, like HDB?Yixiong Chang21 May 2019Well, there will be no additional money owed to your SA. Regardless of profit or loss incurred on your investment, the full amount will be returned to your SA when the investment is sold. For the original poster's question, only the withdrawn amount is used for the calculation of the topup limit (regardless of current investment value).
For the case of HDB, if u sold your property at a lost or at value below the principle+interest, actually u are not required to topup any additional money back to your OA."
