1,"Cherie Julianne TanLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 15 May 2018I'm quite sure you can as long as you have sufficient currency in your MCA for your purchases in the respective countries. For example, if you want to spend in Singapore, ensure that you have enough SGD in your MCA and so on. DBS states, ""With DBS Multi-Currency Autosave, you can save and transact in Singapore dollars and multiple foreign currencies, through one comprehensive account."" So just ensure that you have enough money in your account!â€‹You can link your debit card to that account as well, remember to link it as your primary account. I have mine linked to my DBS Visa Debit card! Hope this helps! :)0 comments1"
