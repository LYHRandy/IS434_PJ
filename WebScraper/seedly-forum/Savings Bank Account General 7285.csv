MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Speaking from my experience when I setup my WeChat Pay last year..Open a bank account with one of the local banksLink your Chinese bank account with WeChat Pay or AliPayTransfer money from your bank account into the WeChat Pay or AliPay walletFunds within your wallet will be available for useIf I'm not wrong, you can't link your Singaporean bank or credit card account with the Chinese app.​Hope that helps!2 comments8"

3,"EterLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 06 Aug 2019In Singapore u can only open up ur wechat wallet using any local bank credit/debit card,but to use wechat payment and top up,u gotta use a China Bank card normally.
Teach u 1 method without having to apply any types of china bank issue card.Download app:""KA-CN"" from google store(app in chinese) to top up ur wechat wallet.It's a chinese app offer by Shenzhen IT company,accepts variety of payment mode,buy top up RMB currency paying in 5 different type which USD is the base one,cost abit more but worth it.After registering,thereafter all top ups purchase from Credit Purchase→Payment Made→Recieve $ In WeChat Wallet every transaction within 1 min +/- on average,ultra fast service,i highly recommend all travellers to China to use as backup(Unless if u're frequent long stayer in China or holidays in China alot then apply China Bank Card)👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
REMINDER TO ALL TRAVELLERS TO CHINA,MAKE SURE U DOWNLOAD ANY VPN(*BEST TO GET A CHINA MOBILE NOS.PREFER AS ALOT COUNTRIES OPERATOR NETWORK DON'T WORK OUT IN THE OPEN,NO PROBLEM WITHIN HOTEL WIFI)U PREFER IN UR RESPECTIVE COUNTRY & SUBSCRIBE BEFORE TRAVEL TO CHINA.PERSONALLY I'M USING ""ExpressVPN"",Happy Holidaying To All CHEERSSS🍻🍻🍻2 comments5"
