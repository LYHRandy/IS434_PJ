For manual payment you can pay by ibanking which is the most convenient and fastest. The other way is by cheque payment, where you send it together with the paper statement you receive.1 comment2"
2,"Question Poster07 Aug 2019Thanks! Have just set up an automatic giro arrangement for my credit card. Silly question - but are there any extra risks to be aware of, by setting up a giro payment for credit card bills? E.g. If there are fradulent transactions that are only discovered after the giro is paid, would I be able to get the money back?"
3,"Kenneth ChanLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 07 Aug 2019No, credit cards (or some debit card for that matter) generally requires a few days to post the transaction and the amount do not get deducted from your account immediately. It is prudent to track your expenses with an app (e.g. seedly) to make sure you do not get carried away with spending.Most credit card have an option to GIRO your bill automatically. Ensure that you have sufficent funds to avoid late payment fee or the insane interest rates they will charge you in an event of a failed deduction. It is good practice to inspect your bill to ensure there are no fraudent transactions as well.DBS altitude card has plenty of terms and conditions that exclude the earning of miles so if you are intending to ""game the system"" to earn miles, please read the terms and conditions carefully first.If the automatic payment is not available from DBS, you can generally request from the service company for a credit card payment form to complete and mail back to them.

What alternative do you use for your DBS credit cards?Kenneth Chan07 Aug 2019They used to support but DBS have had some policy changes that removed that feature I think. Also, I think it is better to input your transactions manually rather than to sync it - it builds discipline in your spending. :)"
