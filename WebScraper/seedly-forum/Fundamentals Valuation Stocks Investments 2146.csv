1,Zann ChuaLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 18 Mar 2019Hello!The free cashflow to the firm can be used to measure a company's profitability after all expenses and reinvestments. It can be used to compare and analyze a firm's financial health. A positice free cash flow would indicate that the firm still has cash left after taking expenses into account. While a negative value would mean that the firm has not generated enough revenue to cover its cost and investment activities. Hope this helps !0 comments1
