question,Savings Bank Account Investments Singapore Saving Bonds (SSB) Asked by AnonymousAsked on 29 May 2019Where should I put 10k right now? I do not have the time to monitor stocks and it's too high-risk for me so that's a no-go. Preferably a place where my capital will not decrease. I recently saw SSB and wonder if that's the best place right now?4 answersAnswerBump2

While not technically an investment, a high interest rate yielding savings account can give you a 2-3% p.a. interest rate. Additionally, if it's not conditional on minimum spending, it's very easy to manage since there isn’t much to do after opening your account.Fully Secured Bonds
Fully Secured Bonds are another excellent low-risk investment option.Certificate of Deposits
A Certificate of Deposit is also considered to be a pretty safe investment. When you invest in term CDs, the bank assures a guaranteed interest rate over a specific time period, or variable-rate CDs where the interest rate is tied to some type of index – like a stock market index.Fixed Deposits
This is a financial instrument provided by banks or NBFCs which provides investors a higher rate of interest than a regular savings account, until the given maturity date. ItETFs
Slightly higher risk then the previous options mentioned, ETFs look to give you exposure to a basket of underlying assets, to create an index that mimics the market index or a market theme. The benefit is that they provide instant diversification. You could look at the various robo advisors to help automate the investing process for you.0 comments3"

If you don't have time to monitor stocks, you can consider robo-advisors for a start. Should you need more info on robo-advisors, you can check out an episode on SeedlyTV here. Alternatively, you can also read more about the Temasek Astrea bond here.There are various robo-advisors in SG namely Stashaway, Smartly, Autowealth, Endowus and MoneyOwl.
