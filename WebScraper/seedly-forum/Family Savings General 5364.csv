1,"Dawn FionaLevel 5. GeniusAnswered on 14 Aug 2018My husband and I adore Asian countries for their food, cheap flight tickets and accessibility over long weekends! Top favorites are Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia :) 0 comments4"
2,"Kenneth Lou, Co-founder at SeedlyLevel 8. WizardAnswered on 14 Aug 2018I'm not budgetbabe... but she'll answer tonight haha! ​Personally, I love going to Taiwan or Bangkok. I go with my other half as a city person and generally you can explore the fringes of the city if you want to get to nature. So those work well withe me :)​And to be honest, these two locations, you can take like 2 days leave and go over the weekend so it becomes like a 4D3N holiday which is fun. And not too pricey as well, food is affordable and delish with accomodation aplenty!0 comments4"
3,"HC Tang, Financial Enthusiast, Budgeting at The SocietyLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019New Zealand : scenery is beautiful beyond descriptions. Kind and friendly people where even petrol stations pump attendance will be nice and friendly and proud of their job. ​Buangkok : friendly people , courteous and very tasty food, not to mentioned super affordable even for students. Lot of nice scenery up north to explore other than major city. 6 comments3"

5,"Charmaine Ng, The Code Breaker at @ Every Chye Peng StallLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 10 Sep 2018Not to sound un-original but yea Taiwan. Let me explain why.First off, I love Japan. But it's expensive. Like, really expensive. I can't take a cab because it'd burn my wallet too much.​But wait, Taiwan?First off, work trip to Taiwan means my flight is settled. Accommodation can be settled through airbnb (shopback app!) and I can take the train from airport to town in just 30minutes. Food is cheap and great plus Taiwan has so many different aspects to it. You can go for nature or you can go for coastal or city as well. If I'm feeling lazy, I can uber/cab without feeling the big dent in my pocket.​It's clean, accessible and people perfects their art .. be it food or culture. For example, I like to go to table for one when I'm in Taipei. Check it out at https://www.klook.com/activity/8712-table-for-one-taipei/ (use shopback for cashback!)​I also love bangkok, malaysia (cameron highlands!) but bangkok can be too dirty at times (sorry I'm a clean freak) and I love Cameron Highlands but it's got too little city life to it. Taiwan is a good mix of both. :)​Hope this helps!0 comments2"

7,"Junus EuTop Contributor (Sep)Level 8. WizardAnswered on 27 May 2019Personally it has got to be Japan, even though I've only been to Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. Food: hard to find bad food here. Even Lawson sandwiches taste amazing, and the price is reasonable.Culture: everyone is incredibly polite and gracious. Sightseeing: hands-down one of the most beautiful views, coming from someone who has travelled to US, most parts of South Asia (including India, Vietnam etc)I always make sure to get the tourist passes that give you access to many sights and destinations - great bang for your buck if you can visit many places in one day.0 comments1"
8,"Ck ChaiLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 10 Oct 2018Love Japan of their culture, scenery, snacks, etc, would love to visit during one of the sakura season!Simply love HK since young, prob due to influence of HK drama, love the food there.... love the existence of old, new building...Love Malaysia & Thailand for the affordable shopping and with many new cafes coming up, would love to check them out!​Have not really travel Taiwan, except for a very rushed 3D 2N trip to kaohsiung. This is definitely one country that I wanted to explore more, though my previous trip is short, I find it enjoyable with many places to visit and many nice street food!0 comments1"
