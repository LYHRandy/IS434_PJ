1,Jessica ChuahLevel 3. WonderkidAnswered on 10 Jul 2018I'm making the assumption of taking a loan with HDB for the answers below. Number 3 and 4 may defer a little if you choose to opt for bank loan​Fees involved include the following:Upon submission of choice of ballot location and flat type: $10 Application Fee (via Credit/Debit card online)Upon attaining a queue number and going down to HDB Hub for flat selection: $2000 option fee applies (via NETS)Upon signing of option to purchase: 5% downpayment (via CPF and/or cash/cheque/cashier's order)Upon signing of sale and purchase agreement: Balance downpayment and 1 to 3% legal fee and stamp duty (via CPF and/or cash/cheque/cashier's order)0 comments3
