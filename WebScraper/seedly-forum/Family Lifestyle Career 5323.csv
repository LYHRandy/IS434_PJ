Maybe you can find ways to transform it instead of going out.Being a family business you have more power to chart the future. If it is brick and mortar, maybe setup a website, start e-commerce for it?I know some friends who have small family business like selling dried food, and went to e-commerce too.0 comments0"

Then question if the why is valid.Without understanding why, you won't have any progress even if your dad approves.0 comments0"
