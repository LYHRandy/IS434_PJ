MasterUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Like Gabriel mention, Singaporeans are not affected by capital gain tax but affected by 30% withholding dividend tax. If you want to trade US stocks, it is better to look at overseas brokers like TD ameritrade, Charles schwab and so on as they usually have better commissions compared to local brokers but you have to double check.3 comments0"

If im not wrong, staying in US for 183 days or more will count you as US resident and your worldwide income will be taxed. But im not too sure about the tax rates in the US.Jonathan Chia Guangrong20 Apr 2019You won't be able to use your sg based brokerage account to trade for long if you are based in the US, as once in a while you need to complete your w8-ben form. Failing which you will be able to perform any transactions."
