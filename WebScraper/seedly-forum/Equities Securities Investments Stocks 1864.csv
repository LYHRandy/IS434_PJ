1,"Isaac Chan, Business  at NUSLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 03 Apr 2019Like what the others have mentioned on Seedly as well, I think it would be more important to stay invested and capitalise on compounded returns rather than trying to perfectly time the market. Talk about a downturn have been occuring for the past few years, yet if you had invested in the S&P, you would have done pretty well.Personally, I would go for a buy and hold strategy, so analysing the fundamentals of the business is more important to me. I believe that when businesses are strong with proper fundamentals, they will still do well in the long run and can earn you decent returns.Of course buying when the market is low means that some stocks could be undervalued due to market sentiment. Over the long run, if the business fundmentals are strong, they should earn you pretty decent returns when the market recovers.0 comments1"
2,"Billy Ko, President - Investment Club at Singapore Institute Of TechnologyLevel 6. MasterAnswered on 03 Apr 2019Amen to what Jansen mentioned. How does one know when the market is low? Therefore, there has been sayings that one should never time the market simply becuase it isn't worth one's time and effort to do so. Nonetheless, market low doesn't equate to a stock price being low because the prices of counters do not necessarily move in correlation with the market direction.So just do your adequate due diligence when investing in a counter and when you feel that the market price is one you feel comfortable entering in then just go ahead and stick with your reasonings. But don't forget to set Take Profits and Stop Losses!0 comments0"

4,"Jansen NgLevel 4. ProdigyUpdated on 02 Apr 2019Of course when the market is low.But therein lies the question, when is the market low? Is it as already at the lowest, or will it go lower? As we cant predict the market, the safest bet would be through dollar cost averaging0 comments0"
