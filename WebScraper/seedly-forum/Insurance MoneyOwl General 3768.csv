1,"Christopher Tan, Executive Director at MoneyOwl Private limitedLevel 6. MasterUpdated on 05 May 2019Dear AnonymousThank you for the question and thank you Tat Tian for helping to answer as well.Just to give a bit of background, in 2014, Providend started DIYInsurance, Singapore’s first insurance comparison site. 1-2 years later, Finally.sg from Rayalliance (a financial advisory firm and not a general insurance company) started a similar site with almost the same model. The difference was that while all advisers at DIYInsurance was salaried to prevent conflict of interest, Rayalliance advisers are commission-based.In 2018, Providend and NTUC Enterprise went into a JV to form MoneyOwl and DIYInsurance was absorbed by MoneyOwl. Today’s MoneyOwl is the 10th social enterprise of NTUC Enterprise. We are not a cooperative. Moneyowl do not just offer insurance advisory service, but since Nov 2018, we have launch an online will writing service and most recently, an investment advisory service using both tech and human wisdom. In a few months time, we will be launching our comprehensive financial planning bionic advisory service.With that, I will say that the key differences between Finally.sg and MoneyOwl are:Corporate Parentage and service offeringsAs mentioned, MoneyOwl is a JV between NTUC Enterprise and Providend. Both are local home grown companies with decades of experience doing good, doing well and doing right for Singaporeans. NTUC is a trusted brand among Singaporeans and Providend is one of the earliest financial advisory firms since 2001. It is well known for its deep expertise in financial advice as well as being a champion for conflict-free and ethical advice. MoneyOwl is a licensed financial adviser as well as fund management company. MoneyOwl is a bionic financial advisory company offering insurance, will writing service, and most recently, our investment advisory service via tech and human advisers.Finally.sg is a insurance portal belonging to Rayalliance, licensed financial adviser. Finally.sg is not a corporate entity. Salaried advisersAt MoneyOwl, we take the giving of conflict-free advice very seriously. At such, all our advisers are salaried based and do not take commissions. This is to ensure that our clients are assured that whatever advice given is purely for their good.Finally.sg is part of Rayallsince and their advisers are commission based.Safe and Secure PlatformAt MoneyOwl, we are very serious in ensuring that we provide a safe and secure platform for you to receive advice. This is why MoneyOwl is ISO27001 certified.These are just some of the difference between MoneyOwl and Finally.sg.Hope this clarifies.0 comments4"

MasterAnswered on 03 May 2019Finally.sg is from Rayalliance, one of the general insurance companies that I have dealt with before. MoneyOwl is a co-op from NTUC and ProvidentBoth seems to provide quotation.Both are semi-bionic from the app and quotation perspective.Maybe Christopher Tan would like to answer this. :P0 comments0"
