question,"Career Loans Education Asked by AnonymousAsked 5d agoShould I pursue a degree in media overseas or in Singapore?The price of going overseas to pursue a degree is the same as going to LASALLE. However, if I pursue a degree in NTU or NUS, it would be cheaper but it is not what I want or just teaching the basics of what I’ve learnt in Poly. However, if I pursue it overseas/LASALLE, I do not have enough money and might need to obtain a study loan. What should I do? Or should I just work?2 answersAnswerBump0"

2,"Leslie KohLevel 4. ProdigyAnswered 4d agoThere are many people that I’ve met in my line of work, that studied one field and went to work in non related industries. My suggestion is, work for a year in the field that you wish to pursue and using the work experience to figure what’s your next course of action while saving up money so that it will not be so taxing on you should you choose to further your studies.0 comments1"
