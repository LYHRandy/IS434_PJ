1,"Siddhant RaizadaLevel 1. FreshieUpdated 2w agoWhile many robo-advisors have come in the market. I would recommend you choose a robo-advisor that provides human advisory as well. In Singapore, I am aware of only Kristal.Ai as the one that provides both Human & Robo support. Other things that they have better than, even the bigger banks like DBS is that they provide personalized portfolio construction even for free accounts. You can get REITS and global ETFs on Kristal.AI. I am in the same situation as you and understand the anxiety it causes. The big banks don't make an effort to understand unless you have loads of money. Hence I prefer to new-age startups like Kristal.AI to start saving for retirement. Hope this helps.Take care.2 comments0"

As robot advisor is built on algorithms, they minimised fees compared to a human advisor and they are mostly invested in ETF, cooperate bonds and access to bonds that are not open to retail investors like you and me. Hence if you are a passive investor, it a great way to start your investment journey. Current Robo-advisor in markethttps://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.seedly.sg/singapore-robo-advisor-investment-comparison/amp/(http:// https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.seedly.sg/singapore-robo-advisor-investment-comparison/amp/)Recently OCBC also released their version of Robo-advisor. If you do not have any trust in these few companies, you can put in a bank Robo-advisor. Some Robo-advisors are backed by big companies, so you do not have to fear and all are SDIC insured.Yeah sure, DCA always a great way but for REITs, your DCA mostly ranged between 3-4K for lower and cheaper fees.If you want to start building a retirement fund, you can set up a SRS account with any of the big banks and then link it with StashAway as they allow investment with SRS, it's a good way to start. Firstly if you are unsure regarding what SRS is https://www.stashaway.sg/supplementary-retirement-schemeAs if you are unsure how to pick stocks or ETF are do not have the time, Stashaway provides an easy solution.I’m currently using Stashaway and Smartly, didn’t try the others, both are great platforms. It's just that Stashaway give more updates and they have a mobile app while Smartly has none.1 comment0"
