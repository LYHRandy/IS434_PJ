question,"Investments Asked by AnonymousAsked on 12 Aug 2018Vanguard Total World Stock ETF or Infinity Global Stock Index Fund?I'm looking at investing in global equity and the natural choice is Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT). It has an expense ratio of 0.04% but with 30% withholding tax on dividend of 2.95%. Infinity Global Stock Index Fund has expense ratio of 0.81% and no dividend and basically tracks the same thing. Platform fee adds up to about 0.35% annually. It offers both SGD and USD fund. Which will you choose and why? Same for S&P 500, Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VS Infinity US 500 Stock Index. If you choose Infinity, USD or SGD?1 answerAnswerBump0"

1,"Gabriel Tham, Tag Team Member at Kenichi Tag TeamLevel 8. WizardUpdated on 07 Jun 2019You can find the similar ETFs listed in London stock exchange. They will not incur withholding taxes. I would choose USD because dividends are paid in USD, so i do not want to change the dividend into SGD to buy the ETF in SGD. Just change to USD once and buy, keep the dividends in USD to buy more.​VWRD/VWRL - vanguard all world etfVUSD - s&p 500 etf​2 comments0"

You would be exposed to currency risk if you invest in USD? is it still preferred to invest in USD if you are planning to DCA monthly on S&P 500 ?Gabriel Tham13 May 2019Well, investing in overseas markets will always involve some currency risk. If you choose SGD, you do not feel the currency risk but the fund itself has stocks in USD, so the currency risk is kind of hidden.

Of course, that also means less hassle for you because you dont change currency yourself.
