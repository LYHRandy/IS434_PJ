question,"Stocks Discussion Investments Asked by David Maximilian TeyAsked on 27 Aug 2019How do I get hardcopy annual reports from companies that I have invested in?I have an account in FSMOne and they offer custodian accounts only, so I am unable to link my CDP account to it and obtain the hardcopy annual report through the brokerage. Was wondering if there is any way around it to obtain it? I have seen annual report request forms before but it is a bit unclear for me as to what I should do and where can I find the relevant information.I would appreciate your advice!1 answerAnswerBump0"
