DollarsandSense,26/9/19 17:00,"[Rewriting My Own Destiny] ""Growing up in a low-income family, I was in my schoolâs financial aid programme and pocket money scheme for as long as I can remember. Every dollar mattered. At home, we had to struggle for daily necessities that others wouldnât even think twice about. Due to the cost of tertiary tuition fees, studying in university was something that never even crossed my mind. Besides, no one in my family had a degree, so I thought that if I studied hard, Iâll be able to study at a polytechnic at best, or I can sign-on as a regular. That was it. I didnât dare to dream of doing anything bigger for my life. For these bleak beginnings, you can say that Iâve turned things around pretty dramatically. At age 25, Iâm currently interning with Youth Corps Singapore (YCS). I manage their web portal, mailing list, and help with outreach efforts. In the evenings, I attend classes for my degree in Sociology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, while also being part-time private hire driver to help pay for my school fees. Iâm also a member of the Peopleâs Association Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA), where I contribute to formulating activities that support and engage the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore. [My Turning Point] Friends who knew me previously still regularly express their shock at my change. From being a bully, to be active in volunteering. From being retained in secondary school to studying in university.  From someone with no expectations or dreams for myself to having plans and goals for the future. All these changes in me are only possible as a result of discovering the world of volunteerism. This journey started when I joined an overseas service-learning trip with Millennia Institute, where I was a student. I surprised myself by finding out how much I enjoyed the pre-trip and actual trip activities, working with beneficiaries locally and in Chiang Mai, Thailand. After graduation, my teacher reminded me that my volunteering journey doesnât have to stop at graduation. Thus, I sought out grassroots volunteering opportunities, which I continue to be active in today, about 5 years on. It was during this time when I discovered Youth Corps Singapore and joined the Youth Corps Leaders Programme, which aims to foster and empower Singapore youths to initiate projects for the community, based on various causes they are passionate about. The structured programme and opportunities aside, my biggest takeaway from this was meeting like-minded youths who shared my passion to serve the community. All along, I thought I was alone, but being involved with Youth Corps Singapore opened my eyes to a whole new world of possibilities. [Advice For Fellow Young Singaporeans] I think many youths, myself included previously, have the impression that volunteering or community work means picking up litter or working with seniors. In fact, there are a wide range of causes that we can contribute such as children, youth-at-risk, mental health, foreign workers, and more. And you can find unique ways to contribute on your own time, in your own way. So, if you think youâre really busy (these days, who isnât?) or if you donât know where to begin, the best way to get started is just to keep an eye out. You donât even need to look so hard. There are newsletters on volunteering opportunities, online articles about various causes, or perhaps word-of-mouth news. Once you find something that resonates with you, that calls out to you, then go for it. Learn more about it, find out more about how you can help.

DollarsandSense,3/7/19 20:00,"âIn financial planning, always put ahead your children's basic needs â primarily nutrition, healthcare, and education â ahead of your wants. They are your responsibility and your asset at the same time. At some point, one should also realise that mental preparation for children is as important as financial preparation. Being mentally prepared means that we are psychologically ready to face challenges that come in child upbringing and being equipped to raise and educate children to become decent individuals. Some affluent parents may assume that money can buy their children all kinds of success, but oftentimes actual cases, as reported by school teachers, show that some of these children fall short of a basic decent character. I think mental preparation is key to addressing this. Marriage isn't just the union of two people; it's the union of two families. So, it is important in marriage to give thought to our family members. Often, the organic reciprocity in being considerate to each other is a recipe for family happiness. The love and support from them is crucial, especially in, but not limited to, the early stages of building a family. In our case, particularly, having parents who support our child upbringing when we have tutorials to attend is an immense blessing that we are truly grateful for, something we cannot valuate in monetary terms. To me, success is fulfilling my responsibilities as a husband, father, and son, on top being a good student. That means that I provide for the family, and I am there when they need me. As for student responsibilities, success is when I participate in class willingly, enquire when I don't understand, and give my best in the work I submit. The outcome (i.e. grades), as I have learned, is often not in my control. I also strive to observe good relations with my lecturers and tutors. As a family person, one should always strive to make decisions level-headedly. Have a leap of faith but measure your capacity before that leap.â - Muhammad 'Arif Bin Muhammad Khairul Tan #SuccessfulSingaporeans Read More: https://dollarsandsense.sg/successful-singaporeans-undergrad-dad-funds-education-raises-family/",66,60,0,6,0,0,0,1,2880308325372552,/story.php?story_fbid=2880308325372552&id=386868888049854
