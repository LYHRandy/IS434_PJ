Mohd Hyder,"Its good to have cpf but that will also run out once all the funds have been used quickly. What i did is to have an alternative short to medium term savings plan and set a side some amount n let it compound on interests annually.  There will be a time i will learn how to invest/set up businesses, buy some properties to generate a cash flow which will lead to passive income...aim to retire before 50yrs old. Wont follow wat the masses are doing now.",Sep/4/19 4,3046073788796004,,
Clement CJ Lim,"Read #2. CPF is very useful in ensuring you have enough for retirement. And don't worry. You only need to keep minimum sum (of about 80k currently) in CPF. The rest of the money is still our money and can be withdrawn.   So those who say ""can see, cannot touch"" are unschooled on the intricacies of CPF and one of those who don't understand how it works",Sep/4/19 4,3044421388961244,,

Ken Tan,"I tend to agree on point 3 only - overleveraging on property. There is just way too many fancy stories that property investing is just a quick ticket to earn $$$$$$.   To be unbiased and standing from a broader perspective - a) we can never predict policy changes. Its not anti or support. Its how some may think differently and we got to understand and respect their perspective rather than being judgemental.  Question is - are you going to put more than 90% cash into your CPF SA?  What if things change? Or will you allocate smaller amount of % instead?  The clarity here is - yes, its attractive interest..compounded over time. Good to put $. But do you have control if things change? So, if one doesnt have sufficient knowledge on ways of growing $...by all means put cash into CPF SA. Or put a smaller %...just have to think if its worthwhile to do so.   The bottomline is, if one is keen to invest, one just need to read, learn, understand and apply. No point attending workshops and then hope things happen. Only oneself know their personal risk.   It also doesnt mean that one save and not invest cant survive in SG. We also have to understand the value of that person's perspective.",Sep/5/19 5,3048281465241903,,
Soh Yuen,Singaporeans are still poor despite working hard and smart because they are not smart in spending their hard earned money. The poors are spending like the rich while the rich are spending like the poors.,Sep/5/19 5,3048842268519156,,
