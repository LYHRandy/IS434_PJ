Ace Cheong,"Maximum mandatory contribution limit is hit with >=6k monthly income with >= 30k bonus, so that's 5 months bonus, not 6 :)",Sep/10/19 10,3062528600483856,,
Jonathan Lee,"IMO yes it's a good idea to top up only if you have extra cash. Though it gives a good risk free return, I can see 2 big downsides. 1. Liquidity, no way for you to get access to it till 55. 2. Huge uncertainty, there's no way to tell how fast and how much will they raise the minimum retirement sum and they could easily shift the age from 55 and beyond.",Sep/10/19 10,3062478860488830,,
Phua Heng Khiang,"A very cleverly written article to make unwary, innocent people to put their hard earn money into an instrument (a choice of this or that) that you will NEVER have control of withdrawing. Tax relief and high interest but don't  forget your principal.......",Sep/10/19 10,3062403040496412,,
Yt Lam,"I do not think ""topup and get it locked up"" in CPF is a good idea, especially MediSave.  Money in MediSave is literarily locked up as it can be used for medical / insurance purposes only.    If one is healthy and does not use Medisave, then the CPF member cannot enjoy his/her Medisave money FOREVER, it can only be passed down to the member's nominee.    If the cpf member has medical conditions, the current rules still require a lot of cash to pay for medical fees.  If so, that Extra money you put in cannot be utilised fully and still need to find more cash to pay the bill.  Make sense? Isn't it better to just keep the cash OUTSIDE Medisave?    Cash outside Medisave can also yield returns higher than the SAFE 4% and most importantly,  IT IS YOUR MONEY.  You can enjoy it anytime, anywhere - this feature cannot be bought by so-called SAFE 4% CPF interest.  You cannot do a thing on what is already locked up, but you can choose NOT to top up further. right?    Nowadays, there are many money scams that offer high interest/ high returns, much higher than 4%.  In the end, you lost almost 100% of your principal plus interest.  CPF is not like that, but your money is locked up forever (as if this is any consolation).  Be wise.",Sep/11/19 11,3061241223945927,,
