Jackie Lee Choon Yau,"This is why some OECD countries of advanced democracy are facing these days. Insolvency. Our current and future government should take serious note at the lessons by other states that have been thru our journey and educate our small nation on the range of cause and effects. Yes, it's a thankless job but it is required of any good government focusing on the longer term for her people.",Sep/30/19 30,3116539401749442,,
William Seah,"I see cpf as a tool. It has pretty decent yields and for a short term no risk yield it‚Äôs a no brainer for me. Except for the liquidity issue.  The problem is people without liquidity will struggle a lot more. We don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to look beyond the immediate struggle; if liquidity is our biggest fear then cpf fails, no matter it‚Äôs benefits.   Ultimately the steps to reassure people is to focus on what cpf does (lifetime payout) and admitting what it doesn‚Äôt do. It is not a lump sum payout. It is not to buy your holiday home, your second spouse or whatever. It‚Äôs to make sure you can afford to live simply. Nothing more.",Sep/30/19 30,3116820191721363,,
Ricky Chan,"I share some of the writer‚Äôs opinion.  Except the part where CPF must stick by their own rules. I think they have stuck to the rules. Except that my view may not be the true reality. I believe some cohort used to take all their CPF at 55? I believe back then, people generally have a shorter life span. For the government and CPF not to adjust is inaction and failing of the government.  Even adjustment of minimum sum is just now enough if we want to stick to our own current lifestyle.   But I belong to the 1M65 thru hardwork, falls, failures, retrenchment and simple life.",Sep/30/19 30,3116932385043477,,
