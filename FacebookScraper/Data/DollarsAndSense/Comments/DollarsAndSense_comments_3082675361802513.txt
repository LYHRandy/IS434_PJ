Jayohee Eddy,"Can I confirm that at 55, if we have lets say 200k in OA and maybe 200k in SA, the RA will be created to make up the FRS of lets say 171500 coming from SA since SA has more than the FRS. This leaves a balance of 28500 in SA and 200k in OA. If one wants to make withdrawals since monies set aside in RA, it come first from SA then OA right? Secondly, can we opt to set aside more into the RA voluntarily? over an above the ERS?",Sep/18/19 18,3082866141783435,,

Jayohee Eddy,"Is it possible to come out with an end-user excel template to key current balances, age now and salary with options to include like max CPF contribution per annum if one is topping up to max contributions allowed till 55, 60, 62 etc? This would give CPF members a better view of their sums",Sep/18/19 18,3082840741785975,,
