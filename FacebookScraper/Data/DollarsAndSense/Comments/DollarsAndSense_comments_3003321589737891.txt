Spartan Izm,"Majority of low and mid class citizens aren't able to retire as how and when they want to Hais...thats sad! üò™ Please CONSIDER ur VOTES this coming election my fellow aunties, uncles, ah ma, ah kong, nenek, datok, makcik, pakcik, anneh, thambi, sisters and brothers of Singaporeans out there. Countless years have past, still no improvements on our well beings to live freely and stress free for the loyal and generous Singaporeans. Yet our current leaders kept on increasing the subsidies(unecessary), periodically give out of our own money and made it sound like its theirs that they are giving us just to make themselves look ""generous"". Unfortunately the increase of retirement age again rising like we owe them our wholes life that they implemented this nonsense. Attention all singapreans, please sit dwn alone one corner to spare urself some reflections on whats been happening all these time! Guys! Live is not all about working hard and still earning hard till our age expires. We do have dreams to retire early and spend the other half of our lives with our love ones and enjoy the remaining age/time we have relaxing( or spending time closer to god), enjoy the things around us and pamper ourselves in the activities we could and wanted to do with our hard earn CPF savings and other various sources of retirement savings income. Thats what life is all about. We are not poor people despite the peanuts earning with high cost of living here, just that our money are all being forcedly siezed by our leaders that are blinded by their never ending greed! üôèüèª kept increasing costs for stuoid reasons.   Guys, Do not be afraid to vote against them, if we dont act now and spare a thought for ourselves and the upcoming generations . Then who will??? Start do some researching on the opposite party at ur clusters and listen to understand what they could and will offer for a better future. Give them chance to prove, like we have given our current leaders more than enough time to prove and provide what they had been offering since many yrs ago before Lee kuan yew, yet nothing have ever been fully done as to what were promised by them to us! For our better lives in years to come living in singapore which we call our home. Instead, they given us more worries in our daily lives due to the increasing costs in singapore, and dragging further and further of our CPF money till most of us are too weak and old or only god knws how long more to live, to enjoy remaining lives.",Sep/20/19 20,3088229297913786,,
