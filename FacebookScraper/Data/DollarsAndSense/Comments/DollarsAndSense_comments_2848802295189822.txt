Shinrui Chow,"i'll not stop for these guys again who say they're doing SHORT survey while carrying a kind of card about an outlet's coffee and even if you say you don't drink coffee, they will persuade you to listen and do SHORT survey saying help him in his quota, and offering a gift (not that i care for that gift).  I only helped him in his quota, and one colleague will appear and voila, it's about their insurance plan - they will offer a small corporate gift (this time i got a recycleable set of spoon folk and chopsticks which look 'unappetising' lol.  Takes a nochalant attitude and response and ready to get up and leave after almost 10 mins before you can get away from the talking which seems non stop.  Even after you stood up, he continues talking, you inch away, he inches forward, arms moving mouth talking.  Rakes up my impatience.  Finally free and before u leave, you suddenly notice another of their own standing in front  glancing suspiciously at you with a dead pan beady set of eyes. ewww. Neva again!!",Jun/23/19 23,2854754664594585,,
