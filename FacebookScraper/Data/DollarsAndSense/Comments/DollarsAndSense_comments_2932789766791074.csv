Sk Tan,"It really depends, maybe I should say luck, I bought whole life insurance plans, some with CI coverage, the longer I hold, the higher the returns (4-5% pa compounded).  And whole life is not for life, I need pay premiums till age 85 and the policy covers for life. I can also choose to surrender if I no longer need the coverage, returns 4-5% pa compounded.  It can also convert it to paidup and covers for life.  It is not for investment, it is for insurance but with cash values should one day I no longer need it.  I have friends with endowment plans with more than 5% pa compounded returns upon maturity.  It is luck with the right insurer!  So make sure u understand the whole life insurance policy u are buying, not just hearsay!",23/Jul/19 Jul,2932816553455062
