SG Critical illness Protection,"Indeed true, upon diagnose of Chronic illness like Diabetes, High Blood, High Cholesterol or Obesity it put in a difficult position to own an insurance.   Most youngsters that we served has very little awareness. They are not wrong knowing that they are healthy, but more often is when their siblings or someone diagnose with Critical illness then they start looking for insurance. By then it will be too late, even at times we manage to get them insured the premium is too costly for them as well.  Stay healthy, exercise regularly, get yourself insured while you are young, healthy and more importantly the premium will be affordable.",17/Jul/19 Jul,2916367305099987
