Shane Geiger,,"I feel the author of this comic is a bit misguided. Being financially competent and getting an inheritance are not mutually exclusive. There are plenty of people out there who get ""inheritances"" from their parents and have the foresight to grow that wealth over time. Maybe his father saw that he was lazy and would squander away anything he was given and felt this was the kick in the ass he needed to learn some financial planning. Honestly, that's what this sounds like to me. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a parent passing down some sort if inheritance to a child and ultimately it is up to that child to do with that inheritance as they please.  A balance in life can be found. I see myself as someone who is very good with money, yet I still find time to have fun and have hobbies. The author of this has sacrificed all of that for the pursuit of wealth. While that is certainly his prerogative, it is not mine. To me, everything in life should be a balance.
