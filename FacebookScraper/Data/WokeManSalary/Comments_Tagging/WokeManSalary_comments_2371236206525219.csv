It is known to have committed severe human rights breach, albeit in the Congo and not the Amazon. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/wwf-report-human-rights-abuses-rangers  But then again, you're also directing funding to the Singapore franchise which is highly unlikely to have projects in S. America...  Humans rights violations particular targeted at indigenous peoples are important because they are the best defence against deforestation. Supporting indigenous people in their pursuit to obtain land rights and defend against external economic extractive motives is one of the best ways of protecting the world's remaining rainforests Other organisations that you could show support for include Survival International https://survivalinternational.org/ or Amazon Watch https://amazonwatch.org/",Aug/25/19 25,2371423576506482
