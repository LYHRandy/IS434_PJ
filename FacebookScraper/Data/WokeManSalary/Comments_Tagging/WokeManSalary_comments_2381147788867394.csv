Hui Chyi Ch'ng,,"This is how we poor people comfort ourselves, in thinking that rich people have this kinda problem..

Reo Caligaran,,"I made this simple ugly comic that gives positive impression to money after death. I am also a financial advocate, but I do believe on a higher purpose of money that it can still solve problem after death.   I think people who are lost in the end of their financial goal are people who aren‚Äôt sure of their self-purpose on the first place. Their lack of self conciousness.  Jack Ma is a perfect ultra rich man example who are self aware by quitting his multi-billion dollar company for his passion to teach and family.",Sep/8/19 8,2381728258809347

Adonis Lee Villamor,,"Nice POV but misses on several reality. Time and Money to me are basically currencies. you can exchange one for the other for a limited period. The more successful people always exchange one for the other with greater yield.  You buy money with time whenever you work on a business, profession, employment, etc. Time you spent has an exchange rate for money which you set with your counterparts.   Now for buying time with money, whenever you buy shortcuts in life, you use money. Riding a bike is cheaper than riding a boat. riding a boat is cheaper than riding a plane. You think you are smart being a cheapskate but what you lost is another tick of your time choosing to ride a bicycle. Also in business, a person given millions in capital will always have an edge over someone who starts everything from zero.  A great example of utilization of time and money in unison is debt leveraging. It is a gamble by locking yourself into huge debts with MONEY you do not have which you believe you can generate in the future TIME. this is double edged though as it can send one to ruins if you abuse it.  Time and money are the most important thing because they can bring success or misery in ones life. they are the most constant to manage and everything else is plain random.",Sep/8/19 8,2381545245494315
Yevgeny  Blinov,,"I so much disagree with that.  I think the idea that, - ""If you're rich you don't know whether your friends are true"", - is wrong. It comes from the old bogus that ""money is the root of all evil""...  Do poor people know for sure their friends are true?  Do poor people have enough time for their family? Don't poor people think about money on daily basis? Don't poor people worry about losing what they have? Are poor people surrounded by honest people? Are poor people happy?  Can't poor people suffer from depressions? Can't poor get robbed?  The reality is that the ""Rich people problems"" are in fact everyone's problems. We should stop demonizing material wealth.",Oct/15/19 15,394658011445426

Jun M. Y Do,,"If he‚Äôs still busy working, he does not have ‚Äútoo much‚Äù money. If he can‚Äôt offer himself leisure, he does not have ‚Äútoo much‚Äù money.  With ‚Äútoo much‚Äù money you can almost anything the world can offer. Even time, figuratively, while people have to wait in line for the next flight...buy your own jet and takes off.  And even love, at the point that you have ‚Äútoo much‚Äù money, you don‚Äôt need to care about the process of making impressions, you don‚Äôt need to go great lengths to achieve something, at that point you can offer your partner anything they needed. Afraid of your partner not loving you and only your money? Well they need you and not the opposite, you can dump them anytime you want and keep finding. After all, isn‚Äôt that the process of finding love? Keep picking until you picked the right person, the difference is this time, you can choose anyone from anywhere.  Friendship at that point is very difficult to earn but not impossible, with that much wealth you can literally build your own society and befriend with people of your standards.  You‚Äôll have the best food in the world, best medical treatment humanity can offer, best experience of any kind, best use of time. Yes even happiness if you know what makes you happy. Nothing that belongs to human will be out of your reach as long as you have ‚Äútoo much‚Äù money.",Sep/8/19 8,2381342528847920

He passed away a few years back due to a heart related issue. it happened once before the incident 2 years back before he died. He had a lot of stress managing his investments and work.

You just need to take down your experiences weekly and then do the ""ùó†ùóºùóªùòÅùóµùóπùòÜ ùó¶ùó≤ùóπùó≥ ùó•ùó≤ùòÉùó∂ùó≤ùòÑ"".   The self review will fix the problems of time, money, hobbies, and especially happiness. You ask yourself and the people around if the list is good and healthy to do, if not then you have to remove, change, and add better habits on the list. Do this in a year and you will have a lot of ""ùóßùó∂ùó∫ùó≤"" spared for your happiness.  Thanks to them I've managed to get awoke from a dead end job that I left, also to seek happiness and fulfillment based on ""ùó¶ùó≤ùóπùó≥-ùóîùó∞ùòÅùòÇùóÆùóπùó∂ùòáùóÆùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª"". üòÅ",Sep/24/19 24,503120930501262
