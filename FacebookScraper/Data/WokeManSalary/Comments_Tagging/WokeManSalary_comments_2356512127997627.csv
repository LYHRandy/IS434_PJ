The Woke Salaryman,,"Thanks everyone for watching out for our interests, really appreciate it. <3   We feel it’s only fair to DBS that we point out that this is a pro-bono collaboration, to help reach out to members of their “The Burrow” community – since we both believe in financial literacy for the wider SG audience.    As for our cheeky declaration: We believe in absolute transparency of our posts – if they’re sponsored, we’ll declare. If they’re not, we’ll indicate they are not!   Love all of you and thanks for watching our back :)",Aug/7/19 7,2357419467906893

Marshall Haven,,"Buy a house. Be independent and move out from your parents' house might be selfish but it's practical in case when loved ones die. Second start a business. Third having a husband/wife is necessary when it comes to taxes, and also to have a children is advantage (said to be nuisance unless if not financial secure, then don't have a child 🤷🏻‍♀️). Fourth, retirement when you saved a big amount of money or other benefits such as loans, savings in bank, st. peter plan (if you know what i mean 😆), land in cemetary (500k each, depends if it's big or small but would rather to get burned into ashes, cremation.) and etc. But if debts are still present, then retirement is not advisable. Milestone reward would be the last thing in my card, like yes freedom and resting yourself AT LAST from shits. 🙌",Aug/6/19 6,2357227327926107
