Tommy Tay,,Sacrifices need to be made to accomplish greater things. The power lies in the one with ability to yolo but choose not to yolo and instead uses his cash flow to do greater things.,May/27/19 27,2301946743454166
Abdul Malik Mohammed Ghazali,,The important thing is to gather and horde as much resources you can for your future self.  And try not to remain a salaryman for too long. Try being an entrepreneur. It's hard but it beats living from paycheque to paycheque.,May/27/19 27,2301838060131701
Sean Goh,,"Me to future self: ""Just give me those Toto numbers!""  Joke aside, lessons here are all valid and true. No government in the world can take care of every citizen and it's up to us to plan for own own future. It's in no one else's hands but ours.",May/27/19 27,2302045060111001

Harper Zheng,,"I was working part-time and I saw an uncle who had $200K (More than the minimum sum for his age) in his CPF with a HDB fully paid. But the government only pay him $200/mnth. So even if you saved 1 million in your CPF, you will only get $1K/mnth. He also told about many ppl especially guys who had no children died and their entire estate, many few hundreds thousands went to the government. The point is if you want a good retirement, vote to change the economic and social situation in Sg. No matter how much tou saved in the current economic and social situation, you will still have to work beyond retirement age. Also how many can actually live to 65.",May/27/19 27,2301823750133132
