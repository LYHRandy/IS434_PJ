Shermon Ong,,"If it was up to my wife and I, we would've definitely done away with the banquet.  However, there's something called ""parents"", and more often than not, the wedding is for them to invite their relatives and friends as a gathering. Some may say it is YOUR wedding, not YOUR PARENTS' one, but cmon, it's easier said than done. Sometimes if spending that extra $30k can prevent a strained and hostile start to your marriage, then maybe it's worth it. After all, our parents don't have many kids to start with and they don't fall within the category of ""irresponsible parents"".  Of course I recognise that every couple's circumstance is unique, so these are just my $0.02's worth. Peace!",Jun/13/19 13,2316057632043077

But 9 out of 10 wedding I have attended, I have heard that one of the couple, mostly the groom, will still have to do some supervision of the event flow here and there during the wedding. Kind of tedious, isn't it?  And for those young couple, who just step into society, and really not much $$ in your pocket, really do consider not spending so much on wedding or just do away with it in exchange for something else that's smaller in scale and that could be more intimate.
