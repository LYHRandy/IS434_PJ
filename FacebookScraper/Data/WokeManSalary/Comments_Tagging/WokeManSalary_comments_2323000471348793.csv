Aroli Marcellinus,,"but currently investment products are really confusing. I mean like why people who want to invest need to learn things like businessman do? We just only wanna grow our money, not doing some business. Even like when I asked whether there is any easy investment program without studying about economics and cashflow, they just told me to study your things. Because of that, I still got doubt where should I invest my movey",Jul/2/19 2,2331576450491195
Dennis Adriansyah Ganda,,"just make sure you know where to invest tho  your neighbour ""investment program with 50% return per month"" definitely is not best choice to go",Jun/22/19 22,2323076161341224

Nicholas Le Hugger,,"Sharing the 3 lessons that I learnt when I'm 30 years old, and I'm glad that its not too late. (35yrs old now)  1) Make it a habit to save your money in the Stock Market (US Market for me), and not in the Bank because its not the Banker's interest to protect the value of your capital.  2) Investing isn't rocket science, and you don't really need to know all the financial numbers to find a good product/company to investment. All you really really need, is a short term money plan (how much to save, how much to invest, etc), a mid term learning objective, and a long term financial goal (how much you want to achieve). And MOST IMPORTANT, an understanding of your risk appetite.  3) Time is far more valuable than money. Don't trade off all your precious time to earn something that will deprecate.",Jun/22/19 22,2323020801346760
Anna Burgess,,"Don't count on inheriting wealth or marrying well. Ex: I knew girls in college who spent all their money going to clubs/sporting events etc in hopes of meeting Mr. Right.  They joked about going to college to earn a Mrs instead of maximizing what they could have learned for a future career.  Don't invest in specific companies. Invest in a general index fund with low fees, add every month and leave it alone.  General index funds will improve or fail on the economy as a whole and single person mismanaging a company will not cause you to lose your investments. There's a reason why most funds are pegged (compared)  against index funds.   Aim for a growth mix if you're young and can tolerate risk in your portfolio (mix of general index funds, emerging market funds, high yield dividend funds) and move to more stable investments in the future (index funds / government bonds and treasuries)  If you have saved enough of a nest egg, consider real estate but first! understand what drives real estate value (location/ accessibility to jobs, location/accessibility to transit options, location/ accessibility to services and entertainment options). People think it's because something is ""trending/popular"" that drives RE sales pricing but it's really those three factors. During the depths of the RE market crash (US) I convinced my husband to buy based on those factors and did well.  Learn to leverage money properly (see above). There are people who will tell you not to go into debt, and if this is for frivolous things like fancy cars etc. then yes it makes sense. However if it is to take advantage of a business opportunity, or because the cost of borrowing is low compared to the guaranteed ROI (bond notes, CDs, etc.) then do that. Ex: if i can buy something I need for 0% interest financing, then I get that thing and put the rest of my money in a CD or similar investment vehicle that can return guaranteed interest.",Jul/24/19 24,2347309095584597
