The Woke Salaryman,Just to be clear: we are not against FAs sharing our content. FAs are also an important part of the financial ecosystem and there are amazing FAs and really crummy ones. Just please don't save out and repost as your own album.,Aug/27/19 27,2372328639749309,,
Weinye Chen,"I am a webcomic artist and have this similar problem. I've made this PSA and have posted it several times (I'll post it every 6 months maybe) and it has helped educate my audience/readers/online passer-bys of my page. It has helped my page immensely and now, this happens to me mucccch less. It is true that some people who do this don't give a damn (and that's truly a shame) but, most people actually don't know that there is an etiquette when it comes to this. Also, I have learned that a lot of people don't tend to read a body of text and would pay more attention to imagery. That's why I chose to make this PSA in this format. I hope that those people will choose to be more responsible with your content in the future too! All the best. Love your work!",Aug/26/19 26,2372275993087907,,
Maybel Heng,"As a Financial Consultant myself, i must say I do not condone such behaviour which the other FA are doing. Its like plagiarism. What you have done is great work which need to be shared from the original source. We can't stop the black sheeps in the industry from doing what is not right but I hope your message can put across to them to stop doing what it's wrong.",Aug/26/19 26,2372289153086591,,
Alief Gusti,"I'm not a FA and I ever shared and translate your post once on my instagram stories, tagging @thewokesalaryman insta account on the story. My question is, am I wrong? Then how to make it right? I never claimed the artworks, always write ""credits to the artist"" or such, and if someone asks me about the content, I always refer them to your page. I translate your panels (with the original text still there) in order to spread the woke and knowledge. I'm a translator myself too so I think my translation is quite delivering enough   So what's your thoughts on my case? I'd like to support you without hurting you. If you need assistance to write in Indonesian language, I'd be happy to help  Hope you reply this, and thanks for the posts. Stay woke",Aug/27/19 27,2372345616414278,,
Fabian Reyes Jr.,"Hi, since you are conveying your knowledge and good intentions in a public social media platform, for you and your work will not be used by others for their own benefit, may I suggest that you introduce your own character with a name that will symbolize your page. No matter who grab and post your work will automatically give credit to you cause its your character who is there. If the content is what people are translating, it would be hard to go each and everyone cause they can say that its their own idea as well. But if the main idea and focus of your intentions as an advocate is for people to be educated like you being a woke salary man, i think let the good deed you imparted do the job to bring you sponsors and people to help you grow your network. I hope you will not stop sharing the wisdom you have for people who wants to be awaken here in social media. God bless and more power to your page ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Aug/26/19 26,2372305986418241,,

Carlos Dimacuha,"I really like your work. It‚Äôs not hust an eye-opener, it‚Äôs also inspiring. It‚Äôs not surprising that people like it and share it. Be that as it may, it‚Äôs totally unacceptable for someone else‚Äôs content to be passed of as their own. It‚Äôs just plain theft. I hope you guys resolve this and get the credit that is due to you. Please keep up the great work.",Aug/27/19 27,2372541829727990,,

XiangRen Tan,"I think it is quite common people do that; especially people like to steal art works of artist üë©‚Äçüé® . Some even print it on t-shirts and bags and claim that the design is there own and make profit out of it!  The only way to stop this is not to post it on Facebook, else it is very hard to stop people from copying! I think that they feel that it is very well drawn that is why they copy it.  Apply for copyright or trademark... or create watermark in every drawing ‚úçÔ∏è v tedious, but very useful. But people will still copy in this century!  I just feel that the only way a responsible and respectable human that wants to use your work, is to at least inform you and do collaborations with you and award you for the hard work.  It is just like how people collect the KTV charges each time their song is being sang in KTV",Aug/26/19 26,2372287803086726,,
