Leanza Garcia,"I love this post and the message! Although to me, the term ‚Äúmoney can‚Äôt buy happiness‚Äù is more of a reminder that there are more important things in life other than money and possessions. Sometimes people‚Äôs greed for money can get in the way of relationships, or we are too busy working for more and more money that we forget WHY we wanted it in the first place (to be able to actually live our lives).  I completely agree though, we need a goal and then plan how to get there, and that requires money!",Jul/3/19 3,2332205483761625,,
Tatang Pyo,"In my opinion, the ""money can't buy happiness"" is some sort of self-relief for people who don't have enough money to fulfill their own form of happiness. This phrase giving people illusion that, they can be happy even though they live in an extreme poverty. There is a huge difference between being happy and living decently.  This illusion is dangerous. When people said they are happy enough living in the slums, because ""money can't buy happiness"" and for them being happy is simply being alive, what do you think would happen?

ÁéãÂÖÉ,"The problem with happiness is that it can be tricky.  You're right that money can ""buy"" the things that can provide us comfort , meanwhile it also can't buy happiness.  However, when you mentioned you need to work to get the money to buy yourself the things that you wanted, like fulfilling your dream, have you realized that some may be miserable while working for so long to achieve their dream ? Not all of us have the luxury to do something we love and make it our source of income at the same time.  Isn't it ironic? People sacrificing their happiness to obtain happiness? That's very contradicting. This is when you should draw the line and tell yourself , is it worth it to keep pursuing your dream , if the process is already killing you slowly ?",Oct/18/19 18,2416815098633996,,

Obviously this money system have to be improve, it has a lot of cons rather than pros, few of the richest man can control the world/financial crisis /extreme poverty etc.  And I'm talking about the Third World country where you can't really do anything get out of proverty.
