Abdul Malik Mohammed Ghazali,The important thing is to gather and horde as much resources you can for your future self.  And try not to remain a salaryman for too long. Try being an entrepreneur. It's hard but it beats living from paycheque to paycheque.,27/May/19 May,2301838060131701
Sean Goh,"Me to future self: ""Just give me those Toto numbers!""  Joke aside, lessons here are all valid and true. No government in the world can take care of every citizen and it's up to us to plan for own own future. It's in no one else's hands but ours.",27/May/19 May,2302045060111001
Tommy Tay,Sacrifices need to be made to accomplish greater things. The power lies in the one with ability to yolo but choose not to yolo and instead uses his cash flow to do greater things.,27/May/19 May,2301946743454166

Harper Zheng,"I was working part-time and I saw an uncle who had $200K (More than the minimum sum for his age) in his CPF with a HDB fully paid. But the government only pay him $200/mnth. So even if you saved 1 million in your CPF, you will only get $1K/mnth. He also told about many ppl especially guys who had no children died and their entire estate, many few hundreds thousands went to the government. The point is if you want a good retirement, vote to change the economic and social situation in Sg. No matter how much tou saved in the current economic and social situation, you will still have to work beyond retirement age. Also how many can actually live to 65.",27/May/19 May,2301823750133132
Rei Poh,Why the hell do all of us wants to work our asses so we can retire at 65?! when we have no health no energy no CPF just to waste our youth on giving money to the banks and CPF? What obnoxious comic promoting garmen propaganda.,27/May/19 May,2301965206785653
Chen TingHan,"Crap... YOLO ftw! U won‚Äôt game, party, and enjoy when u r old. U can‚Äôt walk as much when u travel. Or u can only do all the crazy things alone when u are old. Forget about retirement, u might not even see this day.",28/May/19 May,2302651653383675
