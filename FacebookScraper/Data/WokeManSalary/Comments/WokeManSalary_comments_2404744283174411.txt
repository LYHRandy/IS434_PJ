The Woke Salaryman,"A disclaimer:   This comic is about how WE choose to invest. It‚Äôs not the be all and end all. There are other ways to invest, but this is the one we feel most comfortable with. (We feel like we gotta say this upfront, because investing is like a cult to some people ‚Äì challenge their world-views and they go bonkers).   It won‚Äôt help you get rich quick overnight, but we believe it‚Äôs a pretty efficient way to go about doing things ‚Äì and a much better alternative to just sitting on your butt without doing anything.   This comic also had to take some liberties when explaining analogies. There are space limitations when you create a 40-panel comic about investing, but we have tried ‚Äì as much as possible ‚Äì to create a piece of content that‚Äôs both entertaining and informative.   Finally, we think it‚Äôs important that before you have invest‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶  1) Pay off all your high interest debt (above 3%) 2) Have at least six months of living expenses (I‚Äôd go up to a year) 3) Have to understand that you might lose money and that this is a long term play (more than 10 years) 4) Get covered with proper health insurance   ^ If you‚Äôre not any of the above, please don‚Äôt invest your money. You need to save first.   For those who like reading, we‚Äôve have an article about how we invest here:   https://thewokesalaryman.com/the-woke-salaryman-way-of-investing/  Further reading: https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/07/13/what-most-20-somethings-dont-get-about-investing/",Oct/6/19 6,2404746286507544,"https://thewokesalaryman.com/the-woke-salaryman-way-of-investing/, https://thewokesalaryman.com/2019/07/13/what-most-20-somethings-dont-get-about-investing/","https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthewokesalaryman.com%2Fthe-woke-salaryman-way-of-investing%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR19gXYID99gWzj-HAtQeSm-lehbmvPqf8xY1pAf4iVycS-z-wtw5ViD4_0&h=AT3uNnQJHj28VBlvr708V01nEngl-qE9_T5AeM0t3n23YbgCGvp59ylvVSkDumyOmMNE4TvYvW7_93fgeTGUjND_lxgCKUnfIHjk4khWkZtz5LqWGEUgZ4T6ALAVu8B0r_mhQA34SQ, https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthewokesalaryman.com%2F2019%2F07%2F13%2Fwhat-most-20-somethings-dont-get-about-investing%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR05dGwTXCV6xmHnpuNhFawhdDlwIwQrWWW-khZdWvnbABl1dFEcjxmDD1o&h=AT1b_W8-eVEgfKDB_gcb_IDSJKOxY9tKUFRtMdb0Xd7YnfUdDhOPiOYUwNp5j1hzVjttfqpq8fHBmRPD04ogMvUXsHXGME4hBmzDseV74MSR8Xs9PGEK2g1arxT8S4X7R71kHuT06w"
The Woke Salaryman,"Wanted to put this in before, but we didn't have enough space. Putting this in the comments ‚Äì if it helps you, please upvote this so more people can see.   For Stage 1: STI-ETF (Hill of Passive Investing)  If you're investing $100 per month, I think DBS Invest Saver gives the best rates. For amounts above $500 per month, consider OCBC or POEMS.   (I've found out the best way to get started on this is actually taking a day off, going down to a local branch in person and talk to a real person. Show them this comic and say you wanna do Stage 1. Any competent staff will be able to help you. )  For Stage 2: Global ETFs (Rock of Double Diversification)   Popular platforms to buy global ETFs in Singapore include Standard Charted (go get an account), Interactive Brokers and FundSuperMart.   Buying ETFs based on the London Stock Exchange is your best option because there's less tax (you can google it yourself, too long to explain in this comic)  To make a sweeping statement, if you're buying very frequently, it makes sense not to go with IB or FSM. Otherwise, all options are okay, as long as you spend at least $5,000 per transaction.   (All this is written this to the best of my knowledge, please use only as a guide and do your own research! )  - RM",Oct/6/19 6,2405280213120818,,

Reo Caligaran,"Honestly, I am disappointed that all these effort of conveying information end up with promoting a trading lessons with fees.  Active trading is not even a game of probabilty, it‚Äôs a game of gamble. No one can ever know when it‚Äôs gonna pay your effort and when it can take all your money for trading in a daily basis. Stock is meant for long term investing not for trading and can beat the inflation.  This comics can be used by a lot of mentor-to-be and students are in no advantage. They will gamble for active trading. Google can help you already and many youtube videos.",Oct/5/19 5,2404777649837741,,

Gordian Knot,"Very nice job guys, but if you allow me I would like to add to young investors that there is zero control over stocks, you want to be in control of your future? go for real sustainability be practical: When you can build your house, energetic sustainable and grow your food it's like you are printing money, and you won't worry anymore about economic crisis, or the next recession..what this comic doesn't tell you is the mountain can collapse anytime even if you do everything perfectly, hence the water doesn't rise but you will go down with the mountain...open your eyes, I just saw too many people at the peak of the mountain and back to water in 2008. Now you may say ""it's hard to build a beautiful house and a sustainable system""..well let me use the same analogy of the comic ""sometimes it's better to build a mountain that resist to a storm, than climb one made of sand"". I just want people to see every aspect of reality, and the other alternative paths, I still think this page is great and educational love the work. Thanks GK",Oct/30/19 30,2429786490670190,,

Magdalene Shane Lee,"I was a professional stockbroker. SG market is not ideal for long term investing as many innovative ideas do not exist for breakout stocks. Many of the steady defensives eg REITs are dependent on rental-yield-growth (ie, squeezing businesses in malls). I find that ethically challenging for me.   The best way is to take part in a high growth business as an equity owner or investor.   Stock market is not always going to go up. The naive go all in. The prudent hold cash and await opportunities.   Active investing is hit or miss. You might think a stock might do well based on many things, but when an unfavorable wind blows, the investment falls through.",Oct/5/19 5,2404824676499705,,
