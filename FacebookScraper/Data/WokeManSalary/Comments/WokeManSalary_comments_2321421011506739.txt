The Woke Salaryman,"Some readers here seem confused by the concept of opportunity cost. Further reading:   https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionaleducation/09/mba-real-costs.asp  https://students.collegefactual.com/blog/the-opportunity-cost-of-going-to-college  https://www.ft.com/content/e77b50ba-d9b1-11e6-944b-e7eb37a6aa8e  For the average salaryman ‚Äì education is an investment. Like all investments, for honours year to be worthwhile, your career growth rate should be higher than someone without honours.   This is the misconception the writer had then ‚Äì thinking that her career was going to skyrocket just because of her honours.
