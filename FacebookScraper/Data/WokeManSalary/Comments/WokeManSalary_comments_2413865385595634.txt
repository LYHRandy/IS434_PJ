Steph Chan,"I've done bike touring/camping before and would absolutely do it again. But doing it just to save money/show off how much money you saved on your holiday is not a good reason to go.  You also need to account for the sheer amount of mental and physical energy for preparation, training, planning and mapping, the possibility that your bike might get lost on the flight/that you might get lost on the road/that it might rain/hail the whole time/that you might get injured/ and money spent on equipment/tents/ waterproofing/panniers/ insurance/a decent bicycle.   I would do it more often but i also like travelling with friends who don't have 4+ weeks of leave ever year/ who can't cycle/have chronic illnesses/back issues/joint issues/disabilities that prevent them from camping/cycling for 6h a day. I have considered doing it solo but I also enjoy not worrying about being assaulted/being nagged by my family that I will definitely get attacked while camping alone in remote areas.  But, if you enjoy planning, cycling long distances, seeing amazing sights, being entirely self sufficient and camping it can really be the best way to travel and this is a good place to start:   https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/",Oct/15/19 15,2414002482248591,https://www.crazyguyonabike.com/,https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crazyguyonabike.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0QZoMAlX-eshOzacs-rO8oUoSS_-nDlLDkNpGoIGXBw6h4eiVrwbhEvXU&h=AT0Ibqzi2PQEwCwdmPh1HIN7OrF1DS6zULbCBQTkgcyoktvxKkYbG4Y5IfjVN8oFusFHyd5-IEedOd6M9me2K8jw7HkuXrCDNlQebQmMMlYKNcm2gXSFwi8ba8J5uEGUzznahP5P8A
