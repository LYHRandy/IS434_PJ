I can't blame them. Same goes to those that spoon-feed religion to innocent children, and despise them if they don't do as they are told like sheep to the rhythm of the war-drums. I would never in a million years let this happen to my future child(ren). Never. I choose to do everything independently and never ask anyone for help. And we have the right to be great individuals by doing our duties without hurting the ones around us, and respecting our surroundings.

Vonda Stuart,"Seriously, if a parent works and gives all to the raising of their children, equally important to raise them to be prudent and independent, but if things go south at some point and inflation outrun the retirement plan, a little help from a financially and able child should be available.  We shouldn't plan for our children to support us but family helps family.  When my adult son lost his job and his home he and his family moved in but being the very independent person we raised him to be he didn't want to be there and with 3000dollars that we loaned him, built a business that has led to his financial success and stability.  We didn't do it, he did but we were there when he needed us. You may say that it was our obligation but, once a child is old enough to make their own decisions, good and bad, ends the parents obligation. After that it's love. Why there are families to be a strength for each other like the strands of a rope.

Do you not think that the former group will mostly make the rational decision?   It is the latter group that mostly end up with higher number of children, that this argument can mostly apply to, but is it fair to even make the argument on them at all?   We hear so many times these statements: poor people should stop their bad habits and start saving; poor people should make better decisions to break out; poor people should stop having kids etc. if you have read poverty research, we know that we cannot pin blame on this economic demographic, because their circumstances warrant them to act this way, which is why the poverty cycle is a real thing.

Inex Yip,"k long comment ahead, which I wrote in response.   So many ways to look at it, and having kids is a complicated issue in itself. It is almost gospel truth what was outline here in your sketches, but a bigger truth is, we still need children.  If not to look after ourselves in old age, society as a whole need people to function, unless we have advanced to the stage where robots can do everything, including elderly care, in which we faced a future where humans slowly extinct ourselves.  Say we are not that smart and robotics and AI could not develop at a pace where they can replace humans, we potentially faced an aging population where without younger people (nurses, doctors and etc) to ensure the elderly's basic needs are met- not even enough foodpanda delivery people to deliver food when you have difficulty walking, i can only say good luck to all of us.  The idea of slowly starving to death or falling down with no one knowing you are in deep shit is so real. I say this because my own mum took a fall last week and fractured her hand. Lucky for us it was not serious, but being the ever optimist (hurhur), it could have been.  Had she no kids, few would care how she fare after that. Of course the bigger tragedy would have been she had kids and none of them give a shit. But I like to think she brought up us right and it would be an understatement to say we care a lot what happen to her.  No one knew what is going to happen in the future. Even the best laid plans go a wary. Say your retirement funds are great, you have no financial worries but what crap, you had a stroke/dementia that basically effects your basic functions and decision making abilities, who is going to look after you and make decisions that are in your best interests? Folks, this shit is so very real and not that far down the road for some of us.  If you ask me, having kids is not foolproof with no guaranteed returns and expectations yes, hey but having a plan is better than having no plan. While it is all rainbows and butterflies that you want to raise kids with zero expectations, then as someone sharing the same airspace, I beseech you to raise not a brat but at least a contributing, law abiding member of society, which in my opinion is good enough.  But of course if at the end of the day your kid still do not wish to take care of you for whatever reasons, maybe you have to ask yourself what went wrong in your parenting. As a Chinese, I believe in filial piety. I don't know what you believe in but if you believe right now you have some form of responsibility towards your own parents, what is stopping you from passing on that value?",Jul/23/19 23,2346948465620660,,

Muhammad Faisal Muaz,"This is not all true. Im a father and do not want money from my children when they grew up.

Michael Plaisted,"This kind of position can only be had in a socialist society. In a free society, parents raise their children and then children 'honor their father and mother so that their days may be long on the land'. This is because free societies demand strong families. Children take care of their parents because they love them and see setting an example of how their children are to take care of them when they are old too.  In a socialist society, the elderly are taken care of by their children by force through taxation and social security benefits. And not just their children but the rest of society. You can pick only one of these two options.  '‚ÄúHonour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.‚Äù  Children should remain in the equity of their parents instead of being adopted by rulers through legal citizenship which breaks up the family and installs human Benefactors as equitable ‚Äúfathers‚Äù and demotes parents as ‚Äúlegal guardians‚Äú. Through birth certification, human civil governments assume equitable rights to the education, discipline, healthcare, welfare, and best interests of the child. In exchange, parents receive tax write-offs, and the assurance that their biological offspring will be taken care of by the collective through taxation and bureaucracy. In this way, parents dishonor their children. The honor prescribed by this commandment is a double-edged sword. Children should also take care of their parents in their old age and not rely on the social security of socialist benefactors which makes their neighbor liable for them through covetousness and sloth. Christ called this ‚Äòthe Corban that makes the word of God to none effect.‚Äô Children should assume personal responsibility to care for the elderly of society and not rely on the man-made institutions that appear to be fine establishments but change the nature of society by giving it hard hearts as those personal responsibilities are outsourced, again, to the collective. When children effectively honor their parents, the political party of the family thrives, and the equity and allodium of the family taking dominion over the earth remains in the family instead of being broken up by authoritative institutions that weaken the family. In this way, free societies demand strong families, which enable for ‚Äúthy days to remain long upon the land.‚Äù  Pursuant to the parens patriae doctrine, ‚Äúthe primary control and custody of infants is with the government‚Ä¶‚Äù (Ex parte Wright, 225 Ala. 220)'  https://abolishhumanarchism.com/2018/11/04/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-heaven/",Jul/24/19 24,2347970775518429,https://abolishhumanarchism.com/2018/11/04/the-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-heaven/,https://lm.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabolishhumanarchism.com%2F2018%2F11%2F04%2Fthe-constitution-of-the-kingdom-of-heaven%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0RwBoj9ZDb1M-WQuH5HtoACAPn1QAOnPCzayJV-2Yb5aG4ztIcXikXeCY&h=AT2IZZ-sfNY2HWNM-5a12rCeM6Zz1JwgB6K-GIuJ80OiGr038aVl1cUop7L_pKUpyxyVFjB8LBzIn6avbdDLVicFcoDFy1cnHINPuTl5NGQKiFydOo3AF1GC-bhDLJoRQ9l6i08G-g

Hasan Hamid,"So, they say ""Religions do only harm to humanity. Let humans define what is good by themselves"". But here we have so many diverse and biased opinions about what is good to do on many life aspects.  Islam came when it was a common fear among the people that they can not afford to share their meals with their children so they let the children die or killed them. Islam denies that fear, and tells us that God will provide the living of all His creature with His mercy.  But now, the so-called modern society gets back into the similar fear. However, it is now not the fear by the parents, but the fear by the childrens who are afraid that they will not be able to afford to share their meals with their elderly parents. What a shame!",Jul/21/19 21,2345631335752373,,
