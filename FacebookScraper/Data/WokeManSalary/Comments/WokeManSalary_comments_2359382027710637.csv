Krisnata Panji,"my dad raised me to be independent too,  he didn't buy me cars, fancy phone and any other fancy stuff.   but he provided me with all basic needs so I can focus on learning, he paid for all my education till college, buy me phone and paid the bill, a computer, allowance, motorcycle for everyday transport, by all means, none of it are fancy, just a basic needs.  now i'm in mid 20, just left home last month, with my dream job and pursuing career in it, without parents financial support, even trying to ease their burden with paying for my brother college fees.  while it's important to make your kid independent, providing basic needs for them to be independent is also parents responsibility.  if you can't provide for them, don't make kids. kids are expensive.",13/Aug/19 Aug,471259150322805
Duane Matthew Hipwell,"So miss out on enjoying youth for the sakes of financial capital? Nonsense. I never asked for anything from my parents, and I've worked hard to get into a great position where I live very comfortably. However, when I have kids, I will allow them to enjoy my wealth AND teach them the value of effort and hard work. These are mutually exclusive. You can have one without the other, and you can have both.  It's all about raising children with an understanding and an appreciation of the value of money. You can still do this, even when rewarding them as such in this comic.",10/Aug/19 Aug,2359618087687031
Hui Chyi Ch'ng,"But even if you dad really gave you house and car, it doesn't mean that you won't work hard to acheive financial independence. So, I only agree to this story to a certain extent.

„Ç§„Çß„É≥ „Ç§„É≥,"I think parents could have used another way of saying be financially independent instead of using harsh words that make the child bitter, lost all the time of building meaningful friendship, relationships, the mind became so obsessed with money, wasted so many years of being sad and traumatized by such harsh words is not worth it.

Colleen Hector,I get the message but idk something about this just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me I understand working hard and sacrifice. I come from a poor family so if I have the means to make my child‚Äôs life easier I will while still teaching them the importance of hard work and sacrifice. I especially didn‚Äôt like that u spent most of your childhood angry at your dad when I think about all the missed moments it breaks my heart.

Faizal Nur Ajiz,"I mean, I get the frugal and over achiever mentality. But saying ""you will inherit nothing"" and then do nothing to nurture the child mind is bad parenting in my book.

Patrick Milan,"I disagree. Sometimes the harsh words can bring down someone else‚Äôs confidence that can lead to anxiety and depression. And sadly, it can be passed to the next generation.

Joseph Cabz,At least show in this comic series that his dad assist and help him achieve his dream. All his dad says was inherit nothing. Sometimes those words can cause depression and anxieties to your kids. Not all people become successful regardless of the hardwork they did. A good parent would show an example on how things done.

Harper Zheng,"It really depends on the initial capacity and potential of the child.  If the child is useless, it‚Äôs better to let them see their uselessness and avoid mistakes.

Melinda Leonie,"On another note: In Asia, most parents not only telling their children that the kids would inherit nothing, but the children would also need to take care of their parents when the parents are old.

So he bought the car I want in cash, and I buy that car from him on a 3-year lease üòÑ  So he got his money back plus interest which is much more than just having it Deposit at the Bank, and at the end of the lease I spent less on the car I want.
