Sentosa Gani,"For Australia on 100k income, It should be 24% effective tax rate for residents and 33% for foreigner. 37% is the tax for income above 90k.  20% cpf is subject to 6000 monthly income ceiling",Sep/22/19 22,2392247741090732,,

Lydia Shah,"Will there be more articles discussing different aspects of cpf ? E.g housing, Medisave",Sep/21/19 21,2392259857756187,,
Hime Kang,That's very balanced even though it's sponsored.  CPF can definitely do better esp to help those who need it for crisis at some point even if they are not 55 yet.,Sep/21/19 21,2392345544414285,,
Jonathan Lee,"Australian tax rate is completely wrong... Its much lower... In fact, all the tax rates listed are completely wrong. You need to remember its a marginal tax system. Please update your info, because this is literally fake news.",Sep/23/19 23,2393918337590339,,
William Toh,"Already make compulsory annuity plan and members paid themselves using members money. More people living longer, then will get less monthly. Nothing is quarantine for life as written as cpf life act. If life fund is not solvent, nothing need to be paid to members. Wonderful scheme designed by cpf",Sep/22/19 22,2393506054298234,,

Clement Low,"well, the irony is this. CPF actually 'hurts' the richest - After all, it's 20% of their salary they couldn't have otherwise reallocated to more profitable ventures. Whether it's their own business (which could have an ROI of a few multiples) or some kind of investment.  But the people who seem to be complaining the loudest are people who are coming from the bottom of the income bracket - the very people CPF _really_ benefits. I mean after all, many or even most of them don't actually have the social resources or financial skills to invest and manage their finances. a 4% PA interest rate is far more than most would get by chucking it into a FD. Most would simply gamble it away in some game of chance, and maybe a few might be wise and/or educated enough to put it in the right places to grow more than 4% PA. But they'll be the undoubted exception rather than the norm.  It doesn't help that certain members of the opposition, or some pro-opp vigilantes (I'm looking at you, Roy Ngerng) fuel all that frustration by essentially spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories that the Govt is basically taking CPF. or worse, in RN's case, outright accusing PM Lee for personally pocketing CPF.  I think the most understated point made is the fact that we don't pay the kind of exorbitant taxes that other 'free' and 'first-world countries' pay - taxes which go directly into supporting the previous generation into retirement. CPF comes back to you eventually with interest. You might pay taxes today to support the people of yesterday, but the people of tomorrow pay increased amounts and struggle with the strain to pay the taxes of tomorrow to support you. Even if it benefits you in the here and now, your sons and daughters will directly feel the strain. It's not as if your medical bills when you're old will be cheaper than they are today.  Are there still problems? Sure there are. There are some families who can't make ends meet because part of their pay goes to CPF. But the fact will still remain that the money still comes back to them at a later age - money they'll still need to survive anyway.",Oct/5/19 5,2405186786463494,,
Jieren Azrael Zheng,"Yea I use the SA as my bond portion of my portfolio and looking to invest my OA funds into Dimensional Fund Advisors myself (hopefully via FSMOne, else Endowus).  The rest will be plowed into equities.  That being said, I have been performing beyond a 5% return for the past 6 years. I hope to increase it with experience to hopefully double digits one day.  I feel the amount of tax savings people don't see is understated. I did my own calculations before too.",Sep/21/19 21,2392661694382670,,

Merissa Tan,"I was speaking to a foreigner recently and she ask why am I complaining about CPF because she think it‚Äôs wonderful.  So I asked her why and found out. From their POV they imagine the 20% given to CPF is a bonus sum on top of our monthly pay check and the company contribute an extra 17% for you! In total the company ‚Äúgive you 37% free money in your CPF.‚Äù I have to explain to her the 20% is from our pay check and company only give 17%. Now she agree, CPF suck üòÇ.",Sep/21/19 21,2392587251056781,,
