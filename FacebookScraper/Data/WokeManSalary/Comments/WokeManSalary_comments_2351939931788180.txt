Looney Ng,"Coming as a graduate who worked a full time job for 7 years, left job and drove around for a year and a half, and is now back at a full time job after trying very hard to get back in, this article is pretty accurate.   It’s not worth it if you are a young Singaporean with qualifications.   If you are in the low income bracket and have limited qualifications and would probably never see the other side of 3K on your pay check, despite upgrading yourselves and furthering your studies, maybe.   If you are young and have never tried to better yourself and just go into grab full time? Not a smart move.",Jul/30/19 30,2351996468449193,,
Teri Wong,"As a person from the auto line, doing grab long-term is disastrous.  I can’t compare for sgians, but for Msians. Too many people fall for this trap and then can not afford to bloody well pay their monthly instalment of the car. (Much less their first down payment of the car)  If you’re an uncle/elderly sure...but young folks, sorry you gotta have a second job. Grab driving cannot sustain you.",Jul/30/19 30,2352054118443428,,

Jieren Azrael Zheng,"Agreed The Woke Salaryman. Though it is a very good choice (while the loss making ride hailing companies throw money) for those who has no diploma or degree.  That being said, generally, majority of diploma/degree holders should not consider this option full time, as their career runway and lifetime earnings should be higher. You lose out significantly on work experiences (and CPF) and makes you harder to hire the longer you are not in your industry, compared to peers of your age. Making a jump when your age bracket of your peers exceeding your income is nigh impossible.  Also, once these ride hailing firms move to profitability,  we would expect a very significant drop in incentives (markets can't stay irrational forever).  In addition, huge R&D is done in the self driving space as the skills required is a very low barrier to entry. Do expect to be disrupted in the years to come.",Jul/30/19 30,2351996455115861,The Woke Salaryman,/wokesalaryman/?refid=52&ref=104&__tn__=R

Ken Tan,"A career is a portfolio of job experiences, short term and long term - a journey of self discovery to get oneself empowered to be self-satisfied after finding out more about whats possible, what stretches beyond. For some driving Grab, regardless of age, could be their ""career"" as one just need time flexibility - maybe after some years of work experiences, prefers to drive Grab as compared to a corporate world. That is one's personal preference.   It may also be a young person pursuing media and animation, therefore prefers to work on ad-hoc projects to gain some knowledge while driving Grab for basic needs. That may be exploration of a possible career option of being a Web Designer for example. Thats not delusional. Its just part of one's career planning process.    There are also factors that will influence such decisions such as external commitment that renders a young person to drive Grab too.  Therefore, to use monetary benefits and talk about career, to define something about a young person driving Grab may need further investigation. Different folks look at things differently within a career pathway.  Of course, if a young individual thinks that driving Grab is financially sustainable AND doesnt possess sufficient skills which the workforce demands - then one has to relook on his/her career objectives - and ask questions like ""what does it take to reach there"" - most likely being Grab driver not possible.  Having a blanket statement may just be too far fetched.",Jul/30/19 30,2352098841772289,,

Kenichi Xi,Eh...U earn more as a food rider n can jump ship or work for multiple ship.  U can set a 2hr break for urself if u r good in planning.  No need to worry abt passenger no show.  No need to worry abt child under 1.5m  No need to worry abt parking lot most of the time.  Low maintenance. Higher profit margin.  U r ur on boss.  U eat the customer food just blame it on the merchant   #justsaying,Jul/30/19 30,2352020728446767,#justsaying,/hashtag/justsaying?refid=52&ref=104&__tn__=R
Nasrudin Salim,"This is only true for degree grads, but anyone without a degree, as long as you make more than 4.4k a month, you're better than 50% of Singaporeans. 4.4k is median gross salary including employer cpf, bonuses etc. Once a grab driver makes more than that, they can also pay themselves CPF, and they're better off than 50% of people already, whatever the age. Perhaps need a bit more, 18 days worth a year, to compensate for lack of leaves so 4.7k a month?",Jul/30/19 30,2351981488450691,,

Clement Low,"Agree totally. I had this conversation with a friend. You missed a point though.  See, Let's say being a grab driver, working for equivalent hours gets you 40k at 20YO without needing a degree. It's a lot easier to get into, you can rent rather than buy a car to do this, and you can get a decent, stable income, slightly higher than fresh grad entry salary.  The trouble with grab (on top of the fact that autonomous transport is coming, and threatens to wipe taxi-type services out), is that while working in grab, you gain no real experience. I mean, other than being a very good driver, and a particularly good navigator. Most of the entrepreneurship-related tasks are handled by the grab app itself.  It's not like there's even anything particularly value-added you could do to add value to your service. Once I'm done with a grab ride, even if the fella is really polite, drives really safely and gently, and the whole deal is a super comfy experience, I can hardly even be bothered to rate his services. There's really near zero ways you can do anything that takes any particular kind of passion mixed with ingenuity, anything that future bosses might be interested in.  Which means once he's done being a grab driver and wants to do some work in another industry, whatever he did for grab is completely inapplicable. It doesn't even count as job exp.  So, fine even if earning 4k in your 40s isn't entirely a bad thing (say you're single, or you don't have kids, and maybe you were savvy enough to invest, it's not _entirely_ bad), the fact will still remain that your future earnings potential is severely limited, when pretty much _any_ other job could have gotten you some kind of job exp that future employers would care about.  That said though, if you're some poor uni/poly student, grab is an incredibly good way to bolster your income, pay for school fees and whatnot. Again, if the income is wisely spent or invested at that age, on top of working towards an actual real job at the end of it all, you can support yourself easily as a student.",Aug/11/19 11,2360684667580373,,
