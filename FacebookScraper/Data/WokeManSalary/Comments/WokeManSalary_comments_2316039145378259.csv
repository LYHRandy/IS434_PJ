The Woke Salaryman,Why we think you should spend less money on your wedding today? Because this money could be used to build your future. Money is your twenties is super duper precious.   Further reading here: https://thewokesalaryman.com/youll-probably-hate-hearing-this-but-your-20s-is-not-the-time-to-yolo/,14/Jun/19 Jun,2316439115338262
Shermon Ong,"If it was up to my wife and I, we would've definitely done away with the banquet.  However, there's something called ""parents"", and more often than not, the wedding is for them to invite their relatives and friends as a gathering. Some may say it is YOUR wedding, not YOUR PARENTS' one, but cmon, it's easier said than done. Sometimes if spending that extra $30k can prevent a strained and hostile start to your marriage, then maybe it's worth it. After all, our parents don't have many kids to start with and they don't fall within the category of ""irresponsible parents"".  Of course I recognise that every couple's circumstance is unique, so these are just my $0.02's worth. Peace!",13/Jun/19 Jun,2316057632043077
Tina Liem-Ho,Consider doing away with pre-wedding photo shoot as well. They sell you the idea of posed pictures where you have make up and styles that make you look so glam.. but may or may not look like yourselves. All for a book or montages you will stuff into storage to be brought out every 5 years or more to repack into storage.,15/Jun/19 Jun,2316505695331604
Fara Hanum,Spend on the marriage not on the wedding.,13/Jun/19 Jun,2316059272042913

James Teng,"Did mine in a really intimate way, family and close friends only. No banquet, no gatecrash, no limo. Catered food and held in the church's hall.  Thanks to my wife's negotiation skills, managed to get the best out of the wedding studio package.  Must admit, my parent did cause the amount to increase by more than 2K (flowers, decor and cutlery), but thankfully they covered it.",14/Jun/19 Jun,2316305855351588
Nadia Elias,"There's also the culture of ""forcing"" people to come to a wedding, onion auntie like to say ""If you don't come to my daughters wedding, we won't come to your wedding/nobody will want to come to your wedding!"". So young people become afraid and reluctantly go to far away 2-day trip wedding, spending money on gas and hotel. Yet stay at the wedding for what, 4 hours? It is stupid, if you don't wanna come don't come lah, you ask people come to wedding like ah long ask for his money back, what the hell.",13/Jun/19 Jun,2316047125377461
Eugene Nngs,Exactly what my Wife and I have been thinking about lately. Thank you so much for making this.,14/Jun/19 Jun,2316652291983611
Jeffrey Ng,This is why I prefer attending church and Malay weddings. Its more carefree for the guests and I suspect it would be a lot less stressful for the couple.,14/Jun/19 Jun,2316430392005801
Michael Vincent Vocalan,"For our upcoming wedding we plan it to be a solemn celebration 50pax maximum those who are dear and matter in our life, it‚Äôs a discreet venue in Fort Canning where in I will have the time to entertain my guest great food and open bar all night long. Me and my partner want to give my guest a great time at the wedding where in I have the time to catch up on their lives drink and enjoy the night away.",22/Jun/19 Jun,378866472760445

Alexander Wong,Carmen Lee potluck so pandai. I have an idea. Do away live band. But a lip sync performance. Friends who volunteer get their angpow waived. Min 3 songs. People don't recognise the live band anyway and it's more engaging for a familiar face to be on stage lol,14/Jun/19 Jun,2316608741987966
Chan Gent Ho,I love this so much I want to marry it over a sensible private restaurant lunch.,14/Jun/19 Jun,2316440695338104
Nana Ko,"not entirely true. most restaurant have a minimum spending for u to book their entire restaurant space to hold ur intimate weddings.   if u want to hit the minimum spending they provide, u ll need to invite more ppl which defeats the entire purpose of ur small wedding. it ll still be a space filling wedding.   if u dont do that, u bear the cost of ur guest giving ""below $150 angbao"" when per pax is supposed to be $250++ instead. theres no win-win in every situation.",14/Jun/19 Jun,2316390412009799
CheeHao Lee,"It really depends on the financial situation of the couple. If you are well to do- GO AHEAD to create whatever fantasy wedding you want. But 9 out of 10 wedding I have attended, I have heard that one of the couple, mostly the groom, will still have to do some supervision of the event flow here and there during the wedding. Kind of tedious, isn't it?  And for those young couple, who just step into society, and really not much $$ in your pocket, really do consider not spending so much on wedding or just do away with it in exchange for something else that's smaller in scale and that could be more intimate. Psst, not everyone will give the market rate for ang bao when they attend the banquet. Don't be a dumbass and assume that you can recover your losses through the banquet. You might even incur even greater losses. Haha.",16/Jun/19 Jun,2317989111849929
