Yoe Sugiarto,"My father said, debt for expanding his rich. Waiting for enough money to expand business will take forever or even not work at all. At the end of the term he paid it off his business alive and giving revenue. Means he is richer than before. If we can manage the loan we will be alright",8/Jun/19 Jun,2310572605924913
Haikal Yeo,"Another great article! Really enjoyed reading this and the others too.   Anyway, just want to highlight that not all loans are equal and shouldn‚Äôt always be seen as a bad thing. Yours is an education loan, which is akin to borrowing time to repay money in exchange for learning skills and potentially higher pay, which is a positive trade-off in and of itself. That you picked up financial literacy lessons makes it another win for you too! As opposed to say credit card loan, which is often a negative trade-off if for example, it is an impulse purchase with little benefits. A bit simplistic, but you get the drift. üôÇ",7/Jun/19 Jun,2310339975948176
