The Woke Salaryman,26/8/19 22:43,"My name is Wei Choon, I draw all the stuff you see on The Woke Salaryman. It has come to our attention that a lot of people Ã¢ÂÂ especially financial advisors Ã¢ÂÂ have been saving our images and posting them as their own albums.  Even though we are tagged in the comments, this hurts us. Here's why. THE IMPORTANCE OF SHARES As a small, relatively new (5 months old) page, our future is volatile, and the social performance of our posts (shares, likes, page follows etc) is very important, as it determines whether we might be able to find funding or sponsorship, and ultimately whether we will continue doing this.  We have been doing this for the past 5 months in our free time after work with no promise of fame or fortune. It's not easy, it's not always fun either. We push through the burn out because we want this to be successful and sustainable, but we also do this to help the average salaryman become more financially woke. TRANSLATING/CHANGING OUR POSTS We love when people share from our page directly, because it has our caption and context linked to the post; but it's difficult when we see financial planners and institutions taking our work and repurposing it for their own benefit, especially with a phone number or email at the end: ""Want to become even more woke? Call us at XXXXXXXX!"" Some people take our work and translate them. It's very sweet and we are quite happy people find our message compelling enough to put in the effort to do so.  But please don't do that. We put a lot of time and effort into our stories. If we were to one day translate it, we would do so with people we trust, because it's important that the stories are translated properly and responsibly. HOW YOU CAN HELP US: 1. Stop saving out our works and posting them as your own shit, even if you tag us. 2. Let us know if someone is doing that, and call them out for plagiarism.  We don't want to have to resort to banning people and getting Facebook to take the content down, so we hope we can reason with y'all like woke salarymen. Sincerely, Goh Wei Choon, Co-founder",2736,2400,2,155,9,157,13,39,2372272389754934,/story.php?story_fbid=2372272389754934&id=2250666538582187
