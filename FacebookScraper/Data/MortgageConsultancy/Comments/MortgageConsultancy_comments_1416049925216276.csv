Simon Liu,i like to point out that a 400sqft HDB brand new unit doesnâ€™t cost US$191k. it is even lesser than the price tag. with gov subsidies the price can go to less than 100k. therefore Hk property prices are truly out of this world. singapore is now going towards Hk direction and greed is swindling sg gov to use crazy rent to snuff businesses out and make hdb more and more unaffordable. the trend of smaller and smaller hdb with price unchanged.,26/Aug/19 Aug,1416092085212060
