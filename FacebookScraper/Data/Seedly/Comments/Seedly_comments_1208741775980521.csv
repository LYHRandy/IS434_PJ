Mike Pang,"Bugis Street is women-centric. Very few menswear shops. I was there last week.   myCK menswear is relatively cheap, but the materials they use are uncomfortable.  G2000 prices are ridiculous these days, and they don’t have conservative options (think pleated pants, ties that aren’t ridiculously skinny, etc.)",11/Oct/19 Oct,1208746342646731
