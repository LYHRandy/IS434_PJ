Wayne Goh,"Thanks for educating our fellow Singaporeans on such a complex matter that is CPF. However I would like to point out some things with regards to the advice given:  - Leaving 20k in your OA may not necessarily be a more beneficial choice. Though there is a 1% extra interest on first 20k, if you do not have 20k in your OA the extra 1% interest will still be paid on your first 60k of SA and Medisave combined balance so there is no real loss by leaving 0 in your OA. By leaving 20k in your OA you are actually taking the 1% extra on 20k from your SA and MA accounts and putting it in your OA.  - Topping up SA instead of MA may be a better choice as it gives more time for the returns to compound in your SA. Your medisave balance cannot be transferred to your SA. The excess will only flow to your SA once your MA hits the ceiling but why wait for that to happen when we can straight away top up the SA? Remember that at 55 only your OA and SA balances will combine to form your RA. Your MA will not be merged to form your RA so any excess amount that you have in it will not see the light of day. Although it can be used for careshield life payments,one's mandatory monthly contributions to their medisave should more than cover the insurance premiums so it does not make much sense to overfund it.  - There is a point to consider not to keep topping up your SA. The reason is that you are only allowed to top up to the FRS limit, so the likelihood that you can reach 800k+ in real terms in your SA is actually impossible. After one has hit the FRS he/she would not be able to top up their SA and they will therefore not be able to enjoy tax relief, and considering that the utility of tax relief is a function of one's income which tends to be higher the older one is, it may make sense not to top up your SA in your younger years.",15/Sep/19 Sep,1188467318007967
