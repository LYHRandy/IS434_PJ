Clement Tan,"Incepted in 2009 and still considered young? That is almost 10 years already. Also, the article did not talk about diseconomies of scale. Fund size should not be too big as well. After 10 years, still need to give it a couple of years to mean revert? Maybe you should show proof that SPDR too more than 10 years to mean revert. Seems rather weak excuse otherwise to give a couple more years - be more specific please. Also investing in ETFs that tracks foreign exchanges exposes people to FX risk. I don't see the value of playing devil advocate. Rather, it is good to invest in SG ETF as a starter for those who are new to investing and expand to other markets as the author rightfully mention. Foreign markets quite be rather daunting to newbies.",Oct/22/19 22,1218369355017763,,
