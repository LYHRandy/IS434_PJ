Samuel Ho Chuan Jie,"For people of certain trades, like Financial Advisors, Property Agents & outdoor Salesperson, having a car is still much more practical than ride-hailing! Plus, compared to public transport, both Owning a car & Taking ride hiking gives you your own personal space! Would rather be stuck in a jam in the comfort of a car than to squeeze on a sardine-packed train or Chingay Bus every single day!",Aug/29/19 29,1176220595899306,,
Asphalt Leo McNamara,"Still cheaper to just take a grab. I only ride it when I need it. Owning a car on the other hand, all those additional costs still remain.",Aug/30/19 30,1176789652509067,,
Norm Purcival,That's a very expensive car and a massive underestimate of what ride share costs are,Aug/29/19 29,1176257139228985,,
Jevin Gulliver,ERP costs should be the same on both tables. Riders would also be charged ERP expenses if the PHV passes the gantry. Unless the author would like to clarify that $18 is inclusive of ERP?,Aug/29/19 29,1176277592560273,,
Terence Soon,"There's too many variables, both tangible and intangible, to take into consideration; and I feel this comparison is only valid for a very young person just starting out in his/her career, not married, and not having too much of a social life besides work and going out once a day on weekends. It is as written in the basis of your comparison.  Once you start looking into a 'regular' person's life; i.e. getting married, having children, then the entire equation changes drastically. If both are working parents, the transport costs effectively doubles, which negates the whole private-hire argument. The husband can send the wife to work, or vice-versa. And if you have to send the child(ren) to child-care, school, clinic, etc.; then a basic family car (somewhere around the region of $60-70k depending on when you buy it), would end up being 'cheaper' overall.  Of course, taking into account the intangibles such as having a transport anytime you need it, without getting a heart attack from ridiculous surge pricing, and also the possibility that you are unable to secure a transport at some locations depending on the time of day; and now you see that your article unfortunately only holds true for a very specific segment of the populace. Which I think is quite unrealistic to assume that everyone will remain young and single forever.  Just my 22 cents.",Aug/29/19 29,1176059982582034,,
