Allen Sierra,"Just to check, how often do you guys update your info on the various savings accounts to be used in the calculations in https://seedly.sg/tools/savings-account-calculator#results? For things that change every so often like the SC esaver, do you get the new rates for your site on day 1 of each 2 month cycle?
