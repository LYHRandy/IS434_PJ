Leon Ng,"Hello my name is imran...  The day people like kwek leng beng, karsono kwee, philip ng do courses to teach people how to get rich, then I will believe.   If people know a way to get rich, they would never ever be out telling others how to get rich in the same way. As it would just create more competition for themselves.   So called trainers would rather spend their time on using their own system to maximize profits. Only idiots will share it with others. The reason why they want to conduct a training session is because there is more money to be made by the trainers to invest time n effort in getting students to sign up for the courses n pay for them.",Sep/14/19 14,1187600338094665,,
