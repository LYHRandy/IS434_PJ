Stacie Leong,"Sorry to burst your bubble but bras don’t only cost $15-30 a year. Most females need to own or change more than 0.5-1 bra per year that because it’s our everyday product. Even for the most basic ones from household brand (like young hearts etc) they can easily cost much more than just $15-30 per year.
