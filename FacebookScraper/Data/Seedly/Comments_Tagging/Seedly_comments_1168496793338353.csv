Kenneth Chan,,"Sorry, I can't agree that it's ok to be in debt (except mortgage). If a debt is not productive, it will always be bad - and generally, all personal debts are not productive (not used to improve the generation of income). So it will be advisable to clear off all debt (except mortgage) asap to avoid opportunity cost loss via interest.",Aug/20/19 20,1169929526528413
