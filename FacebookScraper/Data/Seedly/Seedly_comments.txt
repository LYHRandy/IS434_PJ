If people know a way to get rich, they would never ever be out telling others how to get rich in the same way. As it would just create more competition for themselves.   So called trainers would rather spend their time on using their own system to maximize profits. Only idiots will share it with others. The reason why they want to conduct a training session is because there is more money to be made by the trainers to invest time n effort in getting students to sign up for the courses n pay for them.",1187600338094665,,

Fund size should not be too big as well. After 10 years, still need to give it a couple of years to mean revert? Maybe you should show proof that SPDR too more than 10 years to mean revert. Seems rather weak excuse otherwise to give a couple more years - be more specific please. Also investing in ETFs that tracks foreign exchanges exposes people to FX risk. I don't see the value of playing devil advocate. Rather, it is good to invest in SG ETF as a starter for those who are new to investing and expand to other markets as the author rightfully mention.

1187517351436297,Wayne Goh,"Thanks for educating our fellow Singaporeans on such a complex matter that is CPF. However I would like to point out some things with regards to the advice given:  - Leaving 20k in your OA may not necessarily be a more beneficial choice. Though there is a 1% extra interest on first 20k, if you do not have 20k in your OA the extra 1% interest will still be paid on your first 60k of SA and Medisave combined balance so there is no real loss by leaving 0 in your OA. By leaving 20k in your OA you are actually taking the 1% extra on 20k from your SA and MA accounts and putting it in your OA.  - Topping up SA instead of MA may be a better choice as it gives more time for the returns to compound in your SA. Your medisave balance cannot be transferred to your SA. The excess will only flow to your SA once your MA hits the ceiling but why wait for that to happen when we can straight away top up the SA? Remember that at 55 only your OA and SA balances will combine to form your RA. Your MA will not be merged to form your RA so any excess amount that you have in it will not see the light of day. Although it can be used for careshield life payments,one's mandatory monthly contributions to their medisave should more than cover the insurance premiums so it does not make much sense to overfund it.  - There is a point to consider not to keep topping up your SA. The reason is that you are only allowed to top up to the FRS limit, so the likelihood that you can reach 800k+ in real terms in your SA is actually impossible. After one has hit the FRS he/she would not be able to top up their SA and they will therefore not be able to enjoy tax relief, and considering that the utility of tax relief is a function of one's income which tends to be higher the older one is, it may make sense not to top up your SA in your younger years.",1188467318007967,,

1174226542765378,Terence Soon,"There's too many variables, both tangible and intangible, to take into consideration; and I feel this comparison is only valid for a very young person just starting out in his/her career, not married, and not having too much of a social life besides work and going out once a day on weekends. It is as written in the basis of your comparison.  Once you start looking into a 'regular' person's life; i.e. getting married, having children, then the entire equation changes drastically. If both are working parents, the transport costs effectively doubles, which negates the whole private-hire argument. The husband can send the wife to work, or vice-versa. And if you have to send the child(ren) to child-care, school, clinic, etc.; then a basic family car (somewhere around the region of $60-70k depending on when you buy it), would end up being 'cheaper' overall.  Of course, taking into account the intangibles such as having a transport anytime you need it, without getting a heart attack from ridiculous surge pricing, and also the possibility that you are unable to secure a transport at some locations depending on the time of day; and now you see that your article unfortunately only holds true for a very specific segment of the populace. Which I think is quite unrealistic to assume that everyone will remain young and single forever.  Just my 22 cents.",1176059982582034,,
