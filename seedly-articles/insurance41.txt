Comparison of Travel Insurance in Singapore
While they are a whole lot of insurers providing travel insurance as their products, we try to set them apart from each other by breaking it down to their most basic features.
These are the most common terms you will come across when looking for the best travel insurance that suits you:
Personal Accident Payment:

Covers accidental death
An accident resulting in permanent disability
Personal accident payment is paid out if any of the above occurs while traveling, subject to terms and conditions of the policy.

Medical Expenses:

Expenses incurred during one’s trip
This is used to offset the cost incurred when you receive treatment from a hospital or legal physician upon sustaining injury or sickness within 90 days of your trip.
It can include costs such as ambulance service or necessary dental treatment from the accident.

Trip Cancellation:

If something goes wrong, and you have to cancel your trip even before you head for it, the trip cancellation cover for travel insurance allows you to claim a certain sum of money back.

Loss of baggage, money and personal items:
Covers for:

the loss of your belongings
damage to your belongings during the trip
theft of your belongings

Editor’s note: Each travel insurance policy comes with terms and conditions. Make sure to read the reviews and fine prints before making your purchase!
Here’s an overview of how some of the travel insurance compare against each other.

Proper documentation is required for the claims. Make sure to find out what is required.
For example, a police report is required for theft cases. Evidence of the price of your stolen item is necessary too.
Always provide evidence for any of the claims you are trying to make.
