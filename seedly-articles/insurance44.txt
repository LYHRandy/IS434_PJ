Should You Cancel Your Aviva MINDEF/MHA Group Insurance After You ORD?

A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


3 min readThe quickest way to look at insurance is that everyone pays their premium which accumulates into a pool of money. This pool of money will then be used for anyone in the group that ends up having the need to claim for whatever the policy is intended for.
When it comes to insurance, getting the Aviva MINDEF/MHA Group Insurance is probably the first policy most Singaporean guys purchased for themselves.
A lot of us will go on to decide if we should cancel the policy after we ORD. We are not really sure if that is the right decision and did our little bit of research.

During your term of service since 1 July 2016, the MINDEF/ MHA Group insurance is provided for personnel serving their term of National Service.
After their ORD date, they have the option to continue coverage under the Voluntary Scheme.

The Voluntary scheme comprises of Group Term Life Insurance and Group Personal Accident. There are also a few available riders to choose from.
How Group Term Life Insurance And Group Personal Accident Work?

all forms of death (except suicide within the first year of insurance coverage)

A Quick Comparison
With this, we go for the lowest coverage of $100,000 for each.
Assuming:

A 27 years old
A non-smoker
Not looking at coverage for Critical Illness at the moment.

We will be looking at a premium of:

($4.10 + $1) x 12 months = $61.20 yearly

Using Comparefirst, the cheapest premium for Term Insurance with coverage of $100,000 is close to 3 times more, at $184 per year. Of which provides less coverage and no Personal Accident coverage. Hence, the Aviva MINDEF/MHA Group Insurance might just be the most affordable term insurance in the market.
If one chooses the maximum coverage of $1,000,000 for Group Term Life Insurance, he is only looking at a monthly fee of $41. The lowest on Comparefirst for the same amount of coverage is at $55 per month.
Given its coverage, it is also the most value for money in the market.
Why Is The Premium So Affordable Compared To The Rest?
There are a few factors which might have resulted in the cheaper premium when compared to some of the policies out in the market.

The Aviva MINDEF/MHA Group Term Life Insurance does not cover Critical Illness unless you purchase a rider.
The policy is an initiative by the government to recognise the efforts of National Service. This is why part of the premium is subsidised by the government.
As mentioned in the first paragraph, this policy has one of the largest pool of people in Singapore, covering all NS men. This is probably why they are able to come out with such a competitive pricing.
It is ultimately a group insurance, which means in times of a mass disaster one may face difficulty claiming it.
