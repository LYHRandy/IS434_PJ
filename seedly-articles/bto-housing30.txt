Ming Feng


19th August 2018 

A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

HDB rental up the North of Singapore is generally more affordable.
Needless to say, the Central part of Singapore is really expensive in terms of rents for all aspect.
Private landed rental is the most expensive at the Southern part of Singapore.

Back to top

Factors affecting rental price
There are a few factors affecting the cost of rental in Singapore:

The location of the property
While rental for properties closer to the CBD area is generally high, studies have shown that rental is equally in demand out of the city area. 

The kind of facilities the accommodation provides (eg. Pool, gym, etc.)
Also, the main reason why rental for condominiums is usually higher.
Quality of furnishings
The age of the property
Yes! Apparently, age matters when it comes to the rental for private properties. The younger the property, the higher rent it fetches.
How convenient and accessible the location is.
Where is the nearest MRT station? Where can I get food around my neighbourhood?

The location of the accommodation is an important factor. The more convenient it is for someone, the more expensive it is.

Compilation: Rental rates for HDB in Singapore
The general misconception of public housing works very differently for Singapore. While most people believe that public housing is usually not very well-designed, or dangerous, Singapore managed to throw these misconceptions out the window.
In fact, most Singaporeans actually stays in a HDB, and the demand for rental for HDB is also getting more and more popular amongst expats.

From the above table, we can see the types of HDB and area that are less popular amongst the Singapore rental market.

Pros of renting a HDB:

Renting a HDB is probably the best way to enjoy the culture of Singapore to the fullest.
Most HDB estates have coffee shops or hawker centres which mean access to affordable food.

Cons of renting a HDB:

HDB does not come with facilities such as a swimming pool or a gym. This means that additional costs will be incurred if one requires these facilities regularly.
