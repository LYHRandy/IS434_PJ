Data Roaming (Must-Know) Guide For Every Singaporean To Travel With Ease

2 min readAs Millennials, the one thing most of us CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT especially while travelling is THE INTERNET.
Data roaming has increasingly become more popular as their rates are getting more competitive. Despite it not being the cheapest option to get access to the internet overseas, it’s convenience, without having to switch sim-cards, has won the hearts of many.

When I travel to Johor Bahru (JB), most times I would just activate data roaming with StarHub at just S$5 for 1GB, which is cheaper and more convenient than getting a prepaid sim card at JB (if I don’t intend to come back before the sim card expires).
If you find yourself in that situation like me, this one is for you.

TL;DR – Which Telecom Provides The Cheapest Data Roaming Plan to use in JB?
I’m going to use JB as an example because it is where everyone commonly travels to, 

Singtel: S$5/GB for 30 days
M1: S$10 for your local data bundle for 30 days
StarHub: S$5/GB for 3 days
Circles.Life: Pay as you use rate at S$3 per 100MB
MyRepublic: S$6/GB for 30 days

(Click the links above to be teleported to the details below!)
By the way, do not belittle the price of Circles.Life just by looking at this, though it may be costly to data roam in JB but Circles.Life provides the cheapest option for data roaming in the US at $3 per 100MB.
