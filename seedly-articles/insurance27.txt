One of the youngest limit for young & inexperienced driver excess (24 years old)

Our Recommendations

Opt for Lite if you’re a young & inexperienced driver
Opt for Prestige if you:

Just bought a new car
Have kids who just got their driving license
Have bad dreams that your kids will get into a freak accident and somehow manage to flip the car over

Our Recommendations

Choose SmartDrive Essential plans if you own a car that is no longer under warranty – can claim as long as you go to an authorised workshop.
Conversely, SmartDrive Flexi plans are best for new cars that are still under warranty.


DirectAsia Car Insurance

DirectAsia has a wide range of car insurance plans to fit almost any driver, requirement, and age. Here’re the core plans you’ll start with:



 ComprehensiveSOS




WorkshopAuthorisedAuthorised


Replacement CarYes (cars up to 2 years old)-


Young & Inexperienced Driver (<30 years old or license <2 years old) ExcessNot imposed but must be listed as Named DriverNot applicable


Perks-A second chance for comprehensive coverage despite your history of accidents


Best forSeasoned drivers
>30 years oldDrivers who can't get insured elsewhere



Once done, you can choose from 3 flexible Driver Plans or add any optional benefits to your heart’s content.
Highlights

All plans come with a Lifetime Repair Warranty at DirectAsia authorised workshops
If you’ve held 50% NCD for the last 5 consecutive years, you qualify for the DirectAsia exclusive NCD60 and get an extra 10% discount off your base premium
SOS car insurance (a DirectAsia-only offer) if within the last 3 years, you or any of your drivers had 2 or more at fault accidents OR had your/their insurance refused or terminated

Our Recommendations

Choosing a DirectAsia car insurance plan means cheaper premiums as you’ll only be opting-in for the features you want
The NCD60 discount is a no-brainer for safe drivers, it’s also an immediate benefit unlike ‘for life’ NCD schemes where you will only see the benefit in the unfortunate event that you have to make a claim.


Etiqa Car Insurance

Etiqa keeps it simple with only one plan.



 Comprehensive




WorkshopAuthorised


Replacement Car-


Young, Elderly or Inexperienced Driver (<24 years old, >75 years old, or license <2 years old) Excess$4,000


PerksTransport allowance


Best ForOlder cars
Second hand cars
Parallel imports
Seasoned drivers who know what to do during a traffic accident



Highlights

Relatively high personal accident cover ($50,000) for a no-frills plan
Offers optional Sun/Moon Roof Cover (up to $2,000) which allows you to claim for repairs and NOT affect your NCD
One of the youngest limit for young & inexperienced driver excess (24 years old), but really high excess charged ($4,000)

Our Recommendations

Ideal for the budget-conscious, as they always have Etiqa car insurance promos like the Thank Etiqa It’s Friday Sale (25%)
Etiqa’s coverage might seem a little scant especially if you’ve bought a new car, or if you expect a higher level of service
Great for seasoned drivers who know how to handle a traffic accident on their own


FWD Car Insurance

FWD has 3 comprehensive car insurance plans to choose from.

Classic: $250,000

FWD plans, in general, are great for families due to their focus on personal accident coverage


HL Assurance Car Insurance




 Car Protect360

Our Recommendations

Best for seasoned and safe drivers who have a few years of driving experience and a high NCD:

Due high young & inexperienced driver (<27 years old, <2 years driving experience) excess ($,3000)
A high NCD will help offset the premiums which are on the slightly higher side


Not much flexibility in customisation less an NCD protector
