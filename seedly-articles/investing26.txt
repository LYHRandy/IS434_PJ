The Fifth Perspective
Ascendas REIT has a solid track record of delivering consistent growth in revenue, DPU, and NAV over the past 10 years.
The recent acquisition of Ascendas-Singbridge (A-REIT’s sponsor) by CapitaLand in April 2019 also hints at potential synergies with CapitaLand’s sister REITs in the future.

However, A-REIT’s presently high valuation means that investors may prefer to wait for a more opportune time to consider the stock.
