A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

Life Expectancy Of Singapore
Singaporeans are living longer. Our life expectancy at birth is now the longest in the world, at nearly 85 years old, longer than that of Japan.
Looking at how much the world has progressed in the past 85 years, the next 85 years we might be applying for jobs in Mars. Just kidding, but you get the point.
Increased Life Expectancy vs Low Birthrate
With the ageing population, we need to stretch our workforce by allowing seniors to continue working in a more productive environment.
Here are some ways to do so:

Redesigning of training, jobs, and careers around the abilities and strengths of older workers
Singaporeans to adopt the right mindset.
Re-skilling must start even when they are above 40 years old.

To recap on how much Singaporeans need to retire, we take a look at how much we need to retire.

While the above example assumes someone who lives till the age of 90, the changes in retirement and re-employment policies allow Singaporeans to have more time to achieve their retirement goals, should they remain in good health.
Singaporeans A Unique Bunch
Singaporeans are a unique bunch where our heavy expenses such as housing, wedding, education loans are high and front-loaded to the early years of our lives.
This leaves us with little capacity to plan for retirement until the later years. In fact, most Singaporeans will only start their retirement planning at age 37.
While these changes allow one to work longer, there is one factor we fail to take into account. Our number of years in good health.
On average, Singaporeans will only have good health until the age of 73.

These changes in policy can be a good backup plan in life, but we should still aim to retire as early as possible.
