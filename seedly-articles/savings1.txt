A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


5 min readWhile not everyone enjoys serving National Service, it is a statutory requirement for all male Singapore citizens and permanent residents (PR) to do so.
Throwing aside less well-thought-out comments on how National Serviceman’s service should not be measured in monetary value, we understand that the sacrificing of income can be a very huge sacrifice for some.
As the saying goes, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

What Is The Monthly Allowance In National Service?
Before we go ahead with the calculation of how much one can actually save during their NS days, we take a look at the monthly rank allowance.

Monthly rank and combat allowance for NS men in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)
The monthly total allowance of an NS man in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) consists of their rank allowance and monthly combat allowance.
The rank allowance is as shown below:



RankRank Allowance




 Enlistees 


Recruit or Private
(PTE)S$560

Second SergeantS$980


First SergeantS$1050

Officer CadetS$840


Second Lieutenant

On top of rank allowance, NS men are given combat allowance every month, according to the vocation they are in. The combat allowance is as such:

Explosive Ordinance DisposalS$300


Aircrew
Armour
Guards
Infantry
Combat Medics & Officers

The rest of the combatantsS$100



Hence, the total amount which an NS man receives every month is the sum of his rank pay and his combat pay.

Monthly rank and risk allowance for NS men in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF)
The monthly total allowance of an NS man in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) consists of their rank allowance and monthly risk allowance.
The rank allowance is as shown below:

On top of the monthly rank allowance, selected NSFs will also be eligible to receive operational allowance ranging from S$100 to S$300. The allowance is based on the vocation and unit they are deployed in.
Hence, the total amount which an NS man receives every month is the sum of his rank pay and his risk pay.

Monthly rank and vocation allowance for NS men in the Singapore Police Force (SPF)
The monthly total allowance of an NS man in the Singapore Police Force (SPF) consists of their rank allowance and monthly vocation allowance.
The rank allowance is as shown below:

There is also meal allowance provided for the NS men in the Singapore Police Force. The rates are:

S$100 for non-shift work
S$142 for shift work lesser than 12 hours

Hence, the total amount which an NS man receives every month is the sum of his rank pay, his meal allowance and his vocation pay.

Medical Benefits That NSFs Are Entitled To
Well, taking away all the Chao Keng cases, we look at the medical benefits which NSFs are entitled to!
Source: me.me
Here’s where an NSF can seek medical benefits during their NS life and how much they need to pay.



Where To Seek Medical AttentionHow Much Does It Cost?




Medical Centres in campsFree of charge


PolyclinicsFull subsidy


Public hospitalsFull subsidy

Unless hospitalised, cost will be at a subsidised cost, depending on your medical benefits scheme


Private hospitals and private clinicsMaximum reimbursement of $20 per visit. 

(Subject to a limit of $350 per calendar year)



If an NSF is hospitalised, the class of ward they are eligible for is as per below:



RankAll other restructured hospitalsNational University Hospital
(NUH)




Recruit to Lance CorporalClass CClass C


Corporal to First SergeantClass B26-bed


Officer Cadet to LieutenantClass B1 and B2+4-bed



Should one wish to upgrade their ward, only the amount equivalent to the ward which one is eligible for will be subsidised. 80% of the ward charges for you (50% for your dependant), based on the rates at your correct ward eligibility.
Dental Benefits That NSFs Are Entitled To
On top of the medical benefits, an NSF will be able to receive dental treatment free of charge at SAF dental clinics. Should he be referred to a hospital for follow-up treatment, he will be subsidised accordingly.
Under the SAF Dental Subsidy Scheme, an NSF is entitled to 85% reimbursement of expenses from dental treatment. This is provided that the dental treatment is done at a restructured hospital, polyclinic or private dental clinic.
There is, however, a $120 subsidy cap for each calendar year.

How much money can one save during his NS days? – A typical Example
Before we go on with the calculation of the money that one can save, here are some assumptions:

Assuming an NS man follows the 50/30/20 rule when allocating his NS allowance.

As the NS man might have little knowledge about investing, he ends up saving 50% of his allowance, a total of wealth and savings combined.
We break down monthly allowance into weekly instead, for easier calculation.

With that in mind, we went on to set a few scenarios and calculate how much can an NS man save during his NS days.
How much can an NS man in the SAF save over his NS days?
Assuming:

PES A/B1 NS man, hence serving 1 year 10 months
Serves his national service in the Singapore Armed Forces

Depending on his combat allowance, if one:

Went to OCS and became an officer, his total NS allowance ranges from S$22,875 – S$25,125
Went to SCS and became a sergeant, his total NS allowance ranges from S$19,122.50 – S$21,902.50
Went to a unit, his total NS allowance ranges from S$15,470 – S$19,620

This means that should he save 50% of his NS allowance, he would have saved:

S$11,437.50 – S$12,562.50 if he goes to OCS
S$9,561.25 – S$10,951.25 if he goes to SCS
S$7,870 – S$9,810 if he goes straight to a unit.
