Lactose-intolerant, but also BS-intolerant. Having written for the likes of Marina Bay Sands and Time Out, I now spend my days saving up for my stationery shop retirement dream. You can contribute your thoughts like Rebecca here.


3 min readI’ve never been much of a Starbucks fan (yes, I’m one of those) – but I make exceptions for its Christmas beverage menu. To hell with the naysayers; peppermint mocha frappuccino is life.

The Starbucks Rewards Program
Few loyalty programs offer rewards with the same frequency as Starbucks; its Facebook page is strewn with members-only promos like this one:

But if you don’t fall in this camp, here’s a rundown of how the Starbucks Rewards Program works – and the perks you’re missing out on.

Load a minimum of $10 into your Starbucks card (can be purchased in-store)
Register card via Starbucks Singapore app
Verify email to activate account

Welcome Gifts and Rewards
Starbucks sure has a way of encouraging loyalty. Its points system works in the following way:

$1 = 1 star; every 60 stars = free drink
Tiers

Welcome (0 to 59 stars)
Green (60 to 299 stars)
Gold (300 stars and up)



As a new sign-up, you’ll get 1-for-1 drinks on your first 5 stars – and a complimentary upsize on your beverage during your birthday month.

Here’re other perks for Green and Gold Members:
Green Members:

Free drink with every 60 stars
Complimentary slice of cake (with purchase of drink) in birthday month

Gold Members: 

Free drink or food with every 60 stars
Complimentary slice of cake (with purchase of drink) in birthday month
Complimentary drink in birthday month
10% off merchandise in birthday month
Complimentary size upgrade on promotional drink

And lest you think you can hoard your points, you can’t: they expire a year from what Starbucks terms your ‘anniversary date’.
So, let’s say you became a Green member (60 to 299 stars) on 1 Dec, 2018.
You’ll then have to upkeep your stars by collecting another 60 to 299 stars by 30 Nov, 2019 to remain a Green member.
Starbucks Credit Card Promotions

Starbucks regularly runs credit card promos, although these typically expire within three months.
At present, you’ll find two for StanChart members:

Other Starbucks Hacks to Know
Order a Short drink
If you’re short on moolah but desperate for your beverage fix, try ordering a Short (240ml) instead – you’ll score 50 cents off!
Source: tenor
This only applies to hot beverages, though. It’s also perfect if you’re looking for a concentrated caffeine kick, because Short and Tall versions contain equal amounts of espresso.
You could even go full-on cheapo by ordering a hot, then asking for ice cubes (they’re free!).
Save 50 Cents 
You might not know this, but you’ll get 50 cents off your beverage by bringing a tumbler or mug. Just think: by your ninth order, you’d have saved $4.50. That’s enough to fund a flat white from Nylon Coffee Roasters, one of my favourites.
It’s an excellent perk for anyone who bemoans the inconvenience of lugging an already light KeepCup around – and an easy way to accumulate savings, particularly for regular Starbucks goers.
Free Water
Pssh, we scorn at the thought of paying for water. Starbucks seems in agreement on this: iced tap water is free, as is getting a refill for your water bottle.
Brewed Coffee Refills
While brewed coffee costs $3.60, you can get a refill for an extra $1.60. That works out to $5.20, or $2.70 per cup.
Go Halfsies With A Venti
It sounds obvious enough, except I’ve never thought to do this. If you’re willing to split the drink with a friend, though, it means half the cost.
So rather than order two Tall drinks, order the Venti size and ask for an extra cup.
