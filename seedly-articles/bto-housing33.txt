Most of my expenditure is on sustenance. Yes, I meant food. You can contribute your thoughts like Junel here.


2 min readThe BTO quarterly launch has just passed in May last month. Following that comes money worries like whether you have enough money to hold a wedding if you plan on taking up mortgage loans, HDB loans or Bank loans, and even renovation loans. By now we should all know that planning to buy a house isn’t that simple.
Previously on our Facebook Live about getting your first property in Singapore, we talked to Johaan from Qanvast about the importance of interior design and he said that it is an important investment since it determines your resale value and your quality of living. If you skimp on it at the start, you may end up spending more on repainting your house and redoing your flooring.

Estimated Renovation Costs



Housing TypeEstimated Renovation Cost




BTO$30,000 to $60,000


Resale Flat$30,000 to $100,000


Executive Condominium (EC) $10,000 and up



Renovation costs include:

Electrical works and wiring
Built-in cabinets
Painting and redecorating
Structural alterations
External works within the compounds of the house
Flooring and tiling
Basic bathroom fittings

Why do you need to get a renovation loan instead of a personal loan? Well, renovation loans usually charge you lower interest rates and lower processing fees.

Buying a house can be broken down into these few costs and these are the loans you should keep in mind.
1) HDB Loans and Bank Loans

Perks of HDB Loan: Can use CPF, higher maximum loan
Perks of Bank Loan: Lower interest rates


2) Personal Loans
Personal loans should be used to finance your short-term expenditure or emergency expenditure.
This can be used to help you buy furniture, household appliances and bascially every other thing that does not involve what your HDB loan or renovation loan can cover.
Of course, you should always review your spending habits and exercise prudence on your spendings. To repay your loans, you can practice the debt snowball method or debt avalanche method to clear your debts more effectively.
