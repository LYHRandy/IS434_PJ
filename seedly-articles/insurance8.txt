2 min readWhile the rest of us are gearing up for the long weekend thanks to our nation’s 54th birthday (yay!)…
Singapore Life has been busy with the release of two new cancer insurance products: Cancer Plan and Cancer Plus Plan.
You might be wondering, “Is cancer insurance really necessary?”
FYI: the cost of treatment for cancer can range from $8,000 to $17,000 per month.
And if you’re going, “Aiya… Won’t happen to me one lah.”
Well… We’re not saying you will be (touch wood), but it’s a fact that 14,148 Singaporeans are diagnosed with cancer each year (that’s 38 each day, mind you!).
So as with all insurance products, cancer insurance is pretty much a form of protection to ease your burden should the unfortunate happen to you.
