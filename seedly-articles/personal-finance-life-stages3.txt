5 min readWelcome to adulthood.
This is probably a scary time as your responsibilities are suddenly WAAAAAY larger, and it’s even more important that your personal finances are sorted out because you’re:

Probably married (or are planning to)
Buying your first home
Thinking of retirement (whether it’s yours or for your ageing parents’)
Paying for bills like utilities and your car
Getting stuff like insurance and paying more attention to healthcare

Amongst other boring adult stuff that never used to be your problem.
Man… School days seem so much better now huh?
But hey, fret not.
That’s why Seedly‘s here to help!
If you’re ever feeling lost, we gotchu bruv.

Your Personal Guide To Adulthood
Here’s a checklist of all things personal finance in your 30s to 40s:







Money Matters
If you need a refresher or are just hearing about personal finance for the first time… Don’t worry. It’s never too late to start planning and saving for your future.
First, start with the Seedly Money Framework:

Or if you’re a more visual kind of person, check out our Seedly TV Episode 1 for a Beginner’s Guide To Personal Finance instead:

You’re also probably earning a steady paycheque, but the theory behind allocating your monthly salary still remains the same as when you just got your first job.

And since you’ve already been working for a while, you’ll also want to take note of:

Healthcare & Insurance
Taking care of your health is a means of taking care of your wealth.
Think about it.
If you eat poorly and don’t take care of your body, your health will suffer. And that probably means more visits to the doctor or for the really serious cases (knocking on wood) hospitalisation and treatments that could cost you more in the long run.
You may have been able to survive on instant noodles in your twenties, but if you stick to a diet like that in your 30s going 40, your body’s not going to forgive you (or your bank account) for that.
Healthcare
