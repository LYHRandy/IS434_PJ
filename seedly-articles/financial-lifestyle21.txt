3 min readSo… we’ve figured out that taking Grab everywhere is cheaper than owning a car.
And it’s all thanks to the inflated prices of vehicles (due to the COE), as well as a myriad of other costs associated with driving in Singapore.
Regardless of the type of car you choose to buy, one of the biggest bugbears for car owners in space-constrained Singapore would be parking.
I mean, have you ever tried parking in Orchard during lunchtime?

It’s damn siao please.
Since Seedly is all about making smarter personal finance decisions, this got me wondering: where is the cheapest parking in Orchard Road?
Well, I did a little digging and this is what I found out…

TL;DR: Where Is The Cheapest Parking In Orchard Road?

Cheapest Parking In Orchard Road: Weekdays Before 5 or 6pm

Instead of giving you a random list of car parks and having you believe that whatever I found was the cheapest, here’s what I’m going to do.
If you’re heading into town on a weekday before 5pm, I’m guessing it’s to run some errands during lunchtime or to grab lunch with a friend or client.
Lunchtime parking in Orchard is usually slightly more expensive because some shopping malls will tag on a surcharge – yep, that’s capitalism at its finest.
So let’s use that as a guide to figure out where the cheapest parking would be for weekdays before 5 or 6pm.
My rationale is this: if I can find cheap lunchtime parking, then regular time parking should arguably be cheaper.
To make this compilation even more realistic, let’s look at how much it’ll cost for parking for one hour as compared to two hours. Which is typically how much time you’d spend for lunch or just to grab a couple of things in Orchard on a weekday.
Note: if you’re looking to park even longer then maybe looking at the ‘per entry’ options might help keep your parking costs lower.

Cheapest Parking In Orchard Road: Weekdays After 5 or 6pm
