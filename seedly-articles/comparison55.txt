Breaking down 'chim' finance knowledge into manageable pieces so you don't have to. You can contribute your thoughts like Ruth here.


2 min readSingaporeans and residents are known to flock to Johor Bahru(JB) for cheap shopping, given the favourable exchange rate.

JB is the capital of the Malaysian state of Johor and is connected to Singapore by 2 links. Commuters can shuttle between the two countries via bus, train or car and the journey could take anywhere between an hour to 5 hours, including immigration. If you’re planning a trip there, this guide will be of great use for you!

TL;DR: Is it worth GOING TO JB just to shop, or should you just SHOP ONLINE?

If you’re considering other options for your eyes, you’ll want to read this ultimate comparison on lasik, contact lenses and spectacles.
Based on a top review:
“Buying contact lenses are definitely cheaper over there. I usually go over and buy, but sometimes there may be shortage of stocks, hence it’s easier if you stick to one shop and give them a call prior to going down. Better still if they could get the stock for you beforehand but could be tricky as no upfront payment so they might not be willing to help you.”
3. Health and Beauty Products

Another notoriously-cheap-in-JB place to visit would be the Guardian and Watsons.
Based on prices from shopee.sg, the clear winner would be the JB drugstore prices.
Even after adding on costs of entering JB, these prices are pretty unbeatable especially if bought in bulk.
Based on a top review:
“It depends on what you are using as reference to compare with. My friend told me certain supplements similar price but during promotions, it is much cheaper in SG. You really want to know what is cheap by real comparison instead of what many describe as cheap because mostly based on feel…. which can be misleading. I had a list of prices of stuff from various places to compare with. Like buying from:
– Swanton (Chinatown SG) – toiletries, facial items, washing powder always on big discounts
– Red Berries, CK, medical hall (all in Tampines) – various items, e.g. Dynamo 4.1/4,.4kg $8.9 normal price
– NTUC or even Cold Storage depending on what is on promotion, discounte + credit card rebate (5%) or even using NTUC voucher (10% discount) to buy will even be better. Just some examples. “
Verdict –




 JBOnline




ProsCheap, real cheapDoor-step delivery


See and touch products before purchasingsLow or no delivery fee


ConsCosts of travelling to JBLess competitive pricing


Unpredictable waiting timesSpend time on checking for the cheapest website to buy from


Carry back all goods on foot (without car)


Booking in advance



Making a trip to JB makes complete sense for those looking for a getaway, have time to spare, and are looking to buy items in bulk.
On the contrary, if you do not have the luxury of setting aside time to go to JB for a shopping trip, then shopping online would save you great amount of money, time and effort. You decide!
