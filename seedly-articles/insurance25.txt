2 min readI believe we’ve all heard what the media had announced on the launch of AIA Beyond Critical Care,
“First critical illness plan in Singapore to tackle the taboo of mental conditions head-on”
I wouldn’t agree that that’s their unique selling proposition, the 100% refund sounds more enticing to me.
If this plan came without the 100% refund, I would consider carefully the probability of me getting a mental illness – be it through the pressure and stress from work, if it is hereditary, or over the fact that I’m left-handed.
TL;DR – Pros and Cons of AIA Beyond Critical Care

How Much Does AIA Beyond Critical Care Cost?

AIA Beyond Critical Care is a critical illness term insurance with the added mental illness coverage.
What is the difference between Critical Illness and Hospitalisation Insurance?
One covers your loss of income, while the other covers your medical expenses respectively.
Here are the main differences:



Critical IllnessHospitalisation




Insurer (in this case, AIA) pays out a lump sum of money once you are diagnosed with one of the critical illnesses on their list.

The insurer doesn’t care what you do with the lump sum of payout. 

Usually, the money is used for your loss of income as you might not be able to work while you seek treatment. Insurer will cover your hospitalisation and medical costs. 

MediShield Life and/or Integrated Shield plan is an example where every Singaporean/PR is covered by MediShield Life at least.

4. 100% Refund of the Premiums You Have Paid
Refund = Total Annual Premiums paid – Any claims – Any optional riders
Yes, you read that right. At the end of your premium term, AIA will refund you 100% of your the total annual premiums minus any claims paid to you in one lump sum.
If you terminate your plan early, your refunds will be prorated.
We believe that the premiums would be refunded without interest.

How much does it cost to hold it till the end of premium term?
Premium term is fixed at 85 years old or 30 years whichever is later.
In this case of a 26 year old, we have to pay the premiums for the plan for 85 years (Premium term).
For both genders with the same assumptions as above, how much does it cost after 59 years of holding onto the plan?

Female: S$99,828
Male: S$106,200

This would be the estimate amount refunded to you if you’ve held it till you’re 85 years old. (Less the claims already paid to you)
