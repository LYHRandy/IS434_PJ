Most of my expenditure is on sustenance. Yes, I meant food. You can contribute your thoughts like Junel here.


4 min read“Want to BTO?” Has become the indirect Singaporean version of “Will you marry me?” Applying for a BTO is the first step a couple would take towards marriage. This is typically done about three years before the actual marriage, but, anything could happen within the span of three years.
This question was asked by a community member a couple days back:   

Ask A Question Here!

Defaulting On Your BTO
Aka: The heartbreak

If you decide to break-up early into the BTO application, you may only lose the initial $10 fee or else $2000 more if you are already allocated a unit.

What You Can Do To Alleviate The Problem
Hindsight is a beautiful thing, here’s some advice from the community we picked out that may just help if you’re in this dreadful situation now:
1. Appeal To HDB
Appealing to HDB can be an arduous process since it is a case-by-case basis review. Although strict, this may still be worth a shot.
Paul: If financial is an issue, work out with HDB as to whether payment can be by installments etc. If not, approach your MP. Exhaust all appeal avenues until they are closed. Good luck.
2. Transfer Wedding Package
The average cost of a wedding is around $30,000 to $50,000. By the time you have signed your lease, you probably already started preparing for your wedding by engaging a wedding planner and signing for a wedding package. These things definitely won’t come cheap, especially if you have book an expensive hotel for the banquet. However, you can try selling off or transferring your wedding package to someone you know whom is planning for their marriage too.
Siti: For the wedding, is there a way to transfer your package or wedding decor stuff etc to another couple? Maybe can advertise. Surely some couple don’t mind to take over your wedding preparations package at a discounted price?
Steph: Take this w a pinch of salt pls: try selling the wedding package on Carousell?
3. Unorthodox: One Side Takes Over BTO With New Partner
If you manage to find a new partner during this period and are confident of the relationship, it is possible to transfer the flat’s name to your new partner instead.
Hafiz: I have some friends in this situation before. There’s no way out of it… unless one of the couple finds a new partner to take over the BTO… (case by case basis) it did work out for a couple of people that i know of. a bit unorthodox i know. but somehow it worked out for them.
4. Work Hard To Pay Off
The most straightforward way to solve this problem is to work hard enough to pay off this debt. The truth is, you’ve got to still pay at the end of t
Here’s some advice our supportive community has for you:
Veronique: My advice is to pay up, save harder and be thankful you had the wisdom to call it off rather than be married for the sake of the BTO.
5. Prevention: Get Married First
Kenneth: Also, instead of BTO-Ing first, attempt to ROM and actually get married first. I just did that and am happy to report that things are working out well financially
