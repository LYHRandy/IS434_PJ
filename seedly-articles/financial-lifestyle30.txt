5 min readThose of you who have fond memories of your school excursion to the Sentosa Merlion, listen up!
After standing tall over Sentosa for 24 years, the Sentosa Merlion will cease operations on 20 October 2019 as it prepares for demolition.

That’s right, better gather your friends for a trip to Sentosa to relive some of those memories!
The demolition comes with new plans that have been drawn up for Sentosa, including the development of Pulau Brani to form “one big island”.
TL;DR – Maximising Your Trip To Sentosa For The Merlion
I just might go to Sentosa again soon for the Merlion ‘cus I honestly don’t remember going inside…
But anyway, if you’d like bid farewell, good news!

Sentosa Merlion tickets will be available online at a 50% discount for locals, yay! 
The cheapest way to get into Sentosa will be walking in through the Sentosa Boardwalk, of course, it’s free!
When the weather is too hot or if walking is inconvenient for your group, taking Bus RWS8 for $1 will be the next best option!
You’ll probably spend more time there since you’ve already made the effort to travel there, and there might be some activities that you want to try.
If that’s the case, you might want to plan ahead and get yourselves a Fun Pass!

Experiencing The Sentosa Merlion Before It Closes
Good news, everyone!
Sentosa knows that a lot of us would want to make one last trip into the Merlion, whether it’s to relive the story of the Merlion or brushing the Merlion’s teeth while enjoying the awesome view of Singapore.

Sentosa Entry Fees
You’ll have to get to Sentosa first before you can make your way to the Merlion, right?

I know, most of us will just take the Sentosa Express since it’s so accessible from Vivocity, but guys, it’s $4 per admission!
There are so many ways you can get into Sentosa and some of them after cheaper and pretty convenient too!

The cheapest way to get into Sentosa is definitely taking the Sentosa Boardwalk, well it’s free.
But it may not always be feasible if you have young children or senior citizens with you, or if the weather is unbearably hot.
If you’re not in a hurry, the next best option is to spend $1 per person and take Bus RWS8 from VivoCity, before hopping on the Sentosa Express Monorail to whichever stop you’d like to go to.
And if you’re driving, enter during lunch hour or after 5pm on weekdays, and after 5pm on weekends if your aim is to pay the minimum amount for your car’s gantry admission charge. Don’t forget that you’ll have to pay for parking too!
Maximising Your Dollar
Since my rare trips to Sentosa nowadays either involve spending some money and going to the beach club or having a super chill picnic by the beach, I’ve never really given the Fun Pass much consideration.
Until recently…

My partner and I were each given a 55-Token Fun Pass and all we spent out-of-pocket was our brunch when we arrived, and well, some beers midday because it was just so hot.
Granted, we had dinner elsewhere after we left Sentosa but it would still have been super affordable even if we paid for our own Fun Passes!

Should I Use The Fun Pass For Sentosa Merlion?
Please, don’t use your Fun Pass for the Sentosa Merlion okay?
It would have been pretty worth it without the ongoing promotion, but a 50% discount, even the Fun Pass can’t beat that man.
What Can I Use The Fun Pass On And Is It Worth It?
To be honest, I can be such an auntie sometimes that I can’t even deal with it.
So, bear with me, let’s look at how much each token costs you based on your Fun Pass tier.



Fun Pass TierAmount PaidCost Per Token




55 Tokens$43.30$0.79


80 Tokens$61.20$0.76


120 Tokens$89.20$0.74



There are quite a lot of activities covered under the Fun Pass, catering to different interests.

I was a little disappointed to find out that the Skyline Luge is not included in the Fun Pass, so make sure to check if the activities you are interested in are covered under the Fun Pass!
We picked out a few popular activities that Singaporeans usually go for and calculated if the Fun Pass is worth it.

The Standard Adult Ticket Prices above were compiled from each activity’s official website and factors in the discounts available for locals and online purchases.
Also, the equivalent amount spent on each activity if you have the Fun Pass is based on the Cost Per Token ($0.79) for the 55 Tokens Fun Pass.
So if you purchased the 80 or 120 Tokens Fun Pass, you’ll definitely be saving a little bit more!
It sure looks like the Fun Pass is worth getting if you’re planning to do some of these activities above.
However, if you decided to do more on the day itself and needed to top up $5 per 5 tokens, it may not be as worth it anymore.
Just remember to plan a little in advance, in the scenario above, you probably will be able to find better deals online.
Is the Fun Pass & Universal Studios Singapore Combo Worth It?
Source: The Straits Times
I’m not entirely sure about the Fun Pass & Universal Studios Singapore (USS) combo though.
Purchasing a Singapore Resident One-Day Ticket (Anytime) on Resorts World Sentosa’s official website will cost you $75 for an adult ticket and $56 for a child ticket.
Doing a quick calculation would show you that you’re technically paying more for your USS tickets with the Fun Pass combo.



"Base Cost" of Fun PassDifference Paid for USS Adult TicketSingapore Resident 
One-Day Adult Ticket (Anytime)Difference Paid for USS Child TicketSingapore Resident 
One-Day Child Ticket (Anytime)




$43.30 
(55 Tokens)$76.70$75 $56.90$56


$61.20
(80 Tokens)$78.80$58.80


$89.20 
(120 Tokens)$80.80$60.80



Besides, if you’re a little more hardworking, you’ll probably be able to find better deals on their website and other platforms!
But of course, you’d already have saved quite a fair bit of money by getting the basic Fun Pass, so all’s good!
Furthermore, you’re likely to spend most of your time at USS covering all the rides, which means you may not have time to make use of your Fun Pass unless you’re going back the next day.

Will you be heading to Sentosa soon to visit the Merlion one last time before it’s gone?
