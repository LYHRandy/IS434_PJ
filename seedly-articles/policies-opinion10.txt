TL;DR: Here’s All You Need To Know About Your Income Taxes As A Freelancer

Wah Shiok! Freelancers Don’t Need To Pay Taxes (?)
Before you get too happy, this is not true. For those of you who didn’t know, you are required to pay income tax once your income exceeds $22,000 in a year! 
This means that if you’re getting an average, take-home pay of ~$1800/month, you will have to pay income taxes to IRAS.
If you’re not working but receive the following income (that exceeds $22,000/yr), you are also required to pay income taxes:

Income from investments;
NSman income (including all awards and allowance such as IPPT monetary incentives);
Part-time income;
Royalty income;
Pension; or
Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) withdrawals.

Before delving into the details, you have to note that your income tax is tabulated based on your yearly employment income.
For Singapore Residents, your tax rates for 2018/2019 are as follows:

*Note: Chargeable income refers to the income you earn in a year 
For example, if I am earning an average of $3,000 a month as a freelancer, this will amount to $36,000 employment income in a year. Assuming that I do not engage in any activities that will give me tax relief, I will have to pay the following amount in taxes.

For YA 2019, all tax residents will receive an income tax rebate of up to $200. (See the $200 discount in income tax you’re getting in the picture? I’m talking about that 😉 )
You will be treated as a tax resident for a particular YA if you are:

Singaporean citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident residing in Singapore;
A foreigner who has stayed/worked in Singapore (excluding director of a company) for 183 days or more in the previous year.

(However, if you are the BiG B0$$- i.e director of a company, you will be taxed differently)
Too complicated? You can use this Personal tax Calculator to calculate the exact amount of taxes you have to pay!
“I don’t want to pay, can siam or not?”
Let’s get real, nobody really likes to pay taxes. For freelancers and self-employed individuals, there is always that temptation to not declare your income. That is however deemed as tax evasion, and you will get fined for it. 
Not filing your tax return correctly could get you fined up to 300% of the amount of the taxes you were supposed to pay for. You can also be fined up to $10,000 and/or up to 3 years of imprisonment.

How To Declare Your Income As A Self Employed Person? 
Here’s the important part: 
All self-employed persons must report the income earned from their business operations as business income, and not as salary. The business income is part of the total personal income which is taxed at individual income tax rates. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to go about doing it: 



Step 1Report earnings as business income. The business income is part of the total personal income which is taxed at individual income tax rates.


Step 2Decide on the accounting period Every year, you declare your business income for a specific accounting period. The accounting period is usually a 12-month period of trade for which you calculate your profits or losses.
E.g Accounting Period: 1 Jan 2018 to 31 Dec 2018 (YA 2019)


Step 3 Keep Proper Records And AccountsKeep full and accurate records and accounts of your business transactions from the start. These records and accounts must be supported with invoices, receipts, vouchers, and other documents.


Step 4Prepare Statement of Accounts At the end of every accounting period, you must prepare the statement of accounts comprising:

Profit and Loss Accounts
Balance Sheet


Step 5Prepare 4-Line Statement First line: Revenue 
Second line: Gross Profit 
Third Line: Allowable Business Expenses 
Fourth line: Adjusted Profit 


Step 6File Income Tax At the beginning of the year and usually by 15 Mar, IRAS will send you a notification or an individual income tax return (Form B or B1) to report your income. 



For more information, you can refer to the IRAS Website.
