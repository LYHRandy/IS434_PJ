If this is your first time hearing of GREAT220, here’s a mini recap: Great Eastern celebrated their 110th birthday last year and released the SAME short-term endowment plan in commemoration.
Although your Financial Advisor will probably say that the endowment plan this time is different.
They aren’t wrong, it is 3 years this time instead of 5 years from GREAT 270. But seriously, how many of these short-term endowment plans would they like to release in a year?

Soon enough, they will be able to match Singapore Savings Bonds‘ (SSBs) rate of issuance. However, it is still debatable if their risk level is comparable to SSBs since the latter is government-backed.

When should you choose SSBs over Great Eastern’s GREAT220?

If you require liquidity in less than 3 years, SSBs would suit you better as there is no termination fee for withdrawing early
If you feel that S$10,000 is a huge amount to park aside for 3 years; the minimum amount for SSBs is S$500

There are no one-size-fits-all financial products, so remember to continuously do your research and find out how each product is able to suit your financial portfolio.

Watch Out For The “Consumer Mentality”
It’s important for us, as consumers, to approach a financial product objectively. This would ensure that we do not fall prey to purchasing something that we don’t need just because they’ve used gimmicky words like:
“Limited Time Only” or “While Stocks Last” ?
Do not feel pressured, or give in to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and take up these policies, just because.
I mean, the rate of release of these short-term endowment plans – not just Great Eastern – is probably more regular than the times my dog tries to run out of the house when the gates are left unattended (read: A LOT).
In fact, AIA also released one called AIA Smart G3, in commemoration of their 100th anniversary in early 2019.
So even if you missed this, we might just see another or an even better one next time!
In short, DON’T buy into something just because you think you will be losing out if you don’t. There are plenty of other financial products around.
Just like every financial product and financial planning, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to your personal finance journey. However, with careful research and continuous learning, you will be able to better plan your finances.
And as always, read all terms and conditions for any policies or investment instruments. Approach a professional (like your trusted financial advisor) to review your portfolio, and clarify clauses and questions which you might have missed out, before making any decision!
