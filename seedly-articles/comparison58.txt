2 min readAh, the internet will soon be the death of us. In the near future, we will be too lazy to even budge to get water. We are talking about getting groceries online. How many of us have adopted that into our lifestyle?
Too Long; Didn’t Read (TL;DR)

Lowest minimum spent for free delivery: RedMart (with LiveUp membership) at S$40, and honestbee at S$50.
Lowest delivery charge: RedMart at S$3.99.
Always look at their current promotion or deals! (You might get some steals)

Just a Quick Summary



FairPrice On
FairPrice being the most affordable has always been my go-to to get my groceries in stores. There are a huge variety of deals available – they even have deals for 7th month.
At their clearance sale, prices are slashed for products that are near expiry, overstocked, or are at the end of their season.
Out of all the online platforms, only NTUC allows collection in-stores (Click and Collect) for just S$3.
This feature will definitely save my life if I am ever pressed for time. Knowing for a certain that I am able to pop by any NTUC to grab my purchase.
