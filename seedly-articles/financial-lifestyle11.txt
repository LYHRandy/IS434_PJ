1 min readAh, the sweltering heat… Just one of my 101 reasons why I just want to stay in the office during lunch hour to enjoy the air-conditioned office in all its glory.
But I’m hungry.
I guess it is time to finally make use of the food delivery apps that I have on my phone – and I mean MAKE FULL USE.
My personal theory is that if I am going to pay 38% MORE for convenience, I ought to be using a platform that offers me the most discounts or the cheapest delivery charges – best if it’s free.
Hence the creation of this article. You’re welcome.

1st Choice: GrabFood
GrabFood offers one of the lowest delivery fee, no minimum order, and (usually) has the most promo codes.
So it’s a no brainer that they would be our first choice. 
However, a major pain point that I have with using GrabFood is when there is an error with your order. You can only rectify the error with GrabFood (not the restaurant) and it is ALMOST impossible to get on the phone with a GrabFood customer service personnel.

GrabFood Hotline: +65 6902 1038 (You’re welcome?)

 

2nd Choice: foodpanda
And it’s not just because it has Starbucks and Gongcha (you can tell that I really love my coffee and bubble tea). Their delivery fee is the second-lowest, just behind WhyQ (which delivers hawker food).
Plus some restaurants on foodpanda also offer FREE delivery with a minimum order of $5. And that amount should get you a pretty decent meal for lunch – especially if the restaurants in your vicinity aren’t too expensive.

Special Mention: WhyQ
WhyQ has the lowest delivery fee and no minimum order.
In fact, you can even place orders from different stalls in the same hawker centre as part of one order.

Pro Tip: McDelivery
Want your McDonald’s meal delivered to you fast? I usually add a hot fudge sundae or a McFlurry – basically, desserts which WILL melt in Singapore’s sweltering heat – along with my order.
Don’t take my word for it, but I’m pretty sure that the delivery rider will prioritise your order accordingly… winks conspiratorially
