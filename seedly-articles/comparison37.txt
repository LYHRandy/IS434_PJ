2 min readHere at Seedly, we decided to create the ultimate movie ticket price guide for all our fellow Singaporeans!
Online streaming portals like Netflix, Amazon video and even borrowing movies from physical shops are a perfect excuse for us to not leave the comfort of our own home to visit cinemas.

However, nothing beats enjoying a movie on the big screen in comfy seats and not having worry about cleaning up after ourselves. Many Singaporeans know this, which is why Singaporeans visit the cinema an average of 4.2 times a year!
