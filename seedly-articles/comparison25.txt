A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


3 min readSo… there was this picture of renowned Persian beauty, Princess Qajar (her eyebrows are on fleek) who supposedly caused 13 young men to commit suicide after she rejected their offers of marriage.

We kid.
Aside from the fact that it’s fake (historic) news, Princess Qajar is very much like the King of Fruits, durian. While some might feel like puking at the mere sight of it, others love and embrace its… erm… ‘unique’ beauty.
And just like dating a princess, feasting on durian comes with a relatively steep price.

Further Reading: Understanding Your Durian
Curious how durian sellers can tell the difference between durians? Want to impress your date the next time you jio them out for durian?
You’ll want to read this.
1) Mao Shan Wang
Mao Shan Wang comes with a combination of both bitter and sweet flesh. It is usually creamy in texture with a strong bittersweet taste. Till today, it remains one of the most popular choices for Singaporeans.
Source: allaboutdurians.com
How to differentiate: Star-shaped mark at the bottom of its husk.
2) D24
Usually thick and creamy, and less overwhelming in terms of flavour. Recommended for first-time durian eater.
How to differentiate: Stem is usually shorter compared to other breeds. Look for a brown-coloured ring at the bottom of the stem.
Source: Year of the Durian
3) Red Prawn
The flesh of Red Prawn is usually orange-red in colour. And it’s usually more on the sweet side.
How to differentiate: Husk is brown in colour, with short thorns.
4) Golden Phoenix
Golden Phoenix, unlike Red Prawn, lies on the other extreme of the taste buds. It is more known for its bitter taste.
How to differentiate: Sharp needle-like thorns. Fruit usually oval in shape.
5) XO
Like its name, XO durians give an aftertaste similar to that of drinking alcohol.
How to differentiate: Thorns usually pointed inwards at the base of the fruit.
6) Black Gold
Higher grade than the famous Mao Shan Wang, and comes with an intense buttery, bitter aftertaste.
How to differentiate: Dark greyish undertones on the flesh.
How To Choose A Durian
I also spoke to some durian uncles and aunties to learn the trade secret of picking the best durian:

Smell: Smell along the indentations of the durian. Note the strong durian smell. If there isn’t any, the fruit is probably not ripe yet.
Shake the fruit: If it feels as though the flesh of the fruit has lots of room to move, the fruit is probably not ripe yet.
Look at the shape of the durian: Irregular shapes usually mean that the fruit is creamier.

Pro tip: Ensure that the vendor opens a new durian in front of you to prevent them from trying to sell you one that was rejected by the previous customer. I know because I learnt the hard way…
