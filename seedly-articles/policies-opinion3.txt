A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

If you searched ‘GST voucher’, you’ll find tonnes of sceptical comments left by average Singaporeans on social media.
Some of the more interesting comments we came across are:

“The more they give you, the more they take back”
“Candies for everyone… This means that the General Election is near.”
“Give you chicken wing, take back the whole chicken.”

While some of these comments may hold certain truth to it, I decided to adopt a more positive way of looking at the GST voucher.
You know the expression of whether a glass is half empty or half full?
Well, if the government’s giving me money, I’m not going to turn it down.

And from the way I see it… My cup is half full.
I mean, it’s better than nothing right?

You can find the AV of your home on your yearly property tax bill. That is if you file your correspondences properly…

How Much GST Voucher U-Save Credit Will I Get?
One of the perks of staying in an HDB is the U-Save credit you will receive.
FYI, the amount is pegged to the flat type you stay in.
If you’re wondering what U-Save credits can be used for, well, you can use them to offset your ridiculously expensive utility bills (looks at SP group).

On top of that, eligible households will also receive Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates. S&CC are charges that are incurred by HDB owners for the upkeep of their common property.
Here’s a look at how many months of S&CC rebates you are eligible for:

Understanding Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC)
If you’re looking at the number of months of S&CC rebates your household is eligible for, and are going, “Chey… 3.5 months. Like nothing really much leh…”
WRONG.
S&CC charges can range from $54.70 for a 1-room HDB flat to $101 for an Executive. And that’s EVERY MONTH.
Here’s a full list of the Service and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) that various HDB owners are paying:
