A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.

Ever wonder which is the best savings account in Singapore?
If you are still holding on to your POSB Kids Account, do note that the difference for a $10,000 savings can amount to a return flight to Iceland in 10 years time.
Long story short, this article was written for the typical working adult with a few years in the workforce and now looking to re-consider if he/she is on the correct savings accounts.
(Updated 1 April 2019 to reflect all the new savings accounts in the market)

TL;DR: Comparison of Best Savings Account in Singapore
For better analysis, we made an assumption on a typical working adult in Singapore:

Has more than $2,000 credited salary into his savings account after all his CPF contribution
Spends a minimum of $600 a month on a credit card (Daily expenses e.g F&B, Online)
His bank account balance varies accordingly from $10,000 and above 

Here is how you can use it to find the most suitable savings account for you:

Look for the left side condition that gives you a certain amount of base interest
If you meet any of those conditions, simply add up the interest rate
Calculate your total interest rate percentage

Do note that most of these Savings Accounts are bundled with a credit card or product from the same banks to keep Singaporeans in their “eco-system”.


Under potential total interest rate, we use a working adult who only credits his salary into the bank account and does nothing else as the lower interest rate.
The higher interest rate under potential total is when someone maxes out all the stated criteria by the bank.

Editor’s note: This is not a sponsored article. The Seedly Team does not do sponsored articles – all opinions stated here are our own.
We are excluding short-term promotions from this comparison. You will start to realize also that very often, the best products do not give any perks (thus consumers discover them through blog posts like this rather than comparison sites).

Further Reading: A Strategy Involving DBS Multiplier and Any DBS card

Most likely you would have graduated or started working with a DBS or POSB Savings account from when you were a child
However, we feel that it is not wise to keep your savings in that account so you would need to apply for the Multiplier instead
Thus, the best option would be the DBS Multiplier and DBS card where you get the most effective yearly interest in a short amount of time

Limitations of the DBS Combination

You will have to apply for a DBS credit card product and spend a minimum sum on it (or one other category)
Their ATM queues are usually the longest 

Hence, some readers may still choose to start and stick with the OCBC360 or UOBONE accounts as the difference in interest amounts do not differ significantly in the lower balance amounts. (from $10,000 to $30,000)
For the foreign bank accounts (eg BOC, SCB), do note that usually the locations are limited and also, the ATM withdrawals can be more tricky. Lastly, many of our readers have also expressed the difficulty in using the iBanking and mobile banking applications.
Important things to note:

Take note that the above chart heavily depends on the monthly spending on the relevant card (Rebates)
If you are spending with different cards for miles etc, numbers will definitely be affected.
Regarding Salary GIRO credit, do check with your HR manager in your company whether it is under the transaction code: SAL
Fun fact: There is no free lunch in the world, the banks are competing for our business to get more data on your salary and spending numbers to potentially up-sell you and hope you buy other banking products in the future (eg. loans, mortgages etc.)

 DBS Multiplier Account Interest Rate

Savings Account: DBS Multiplier Account
Spending Card: DBS Credit cards
The Realistic interest rate of 1.55% was calculated with $2,600 worth of transactions = $2,000 Salary + $600 Card Spend 
However, the best part about it is that you can just shift it around accordingly, for example, $2,600 worth of transactions = $2,500 Salary + $100 Card Spend

DBS Multiplier has a very low base interest rate of 0.05% per annum.
However, one can earn extra interest by crediting his salary and performing a number of actions on a monthly basis:

Spend using any DBS or POSB credit cards
Investing with your DBS or POSB account or crediting your investment dividends to your DBS or POSB account
Getting insurance from DBS or POSB
Get a home loan from DBS or POSB

If you are wondering how is the interest rate of DBS Multiplier Savings account calculated since there is no minimum amount for each action, nor is there an interest rate pegged to each action. The interest rate is influenced by the total amount of transactions performed. One needs to have a total transaction of at least $2,000 to qualify for bonus interest.
Based on these factors, here’s what kind of interest you can get on the DBS Multiplier account. Interest rate below is valid for bank balances up to $50,000 only.
