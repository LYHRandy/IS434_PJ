The power of NS Allowance
There is a saying which says that serving the NS is like getting paid to keep fit and look at memes. This is true to a certain extent!
On top of the allowance we will be getting, here are some of the benefits we tend to overlook when in NS:

Save on transport fees when you stay in camp
Save money on fashion since you wear uniform on weekdays

We did a calculation on how much one can save during his NS days in total:
