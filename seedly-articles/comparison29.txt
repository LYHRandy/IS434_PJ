How Much Does It Cost To Hold A Funeral Service In Singapore?

28th April 2019 

A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


5 min readMost of us live in constant pursuit of happiness. Be it keeping up with the latest fashion and iPhone, or retiring early with a beautiful home fully paid, we seem to put retirement as our finishing line.
But have we ever wondered what comes after retirement?

While financial planning is important for the most part of our lives, it is equally important to look at the costs of death (“touch wood!”)
A step-by-step guide to funeral services in Singapore
We compiled a step-by-step guide, to what comes after life and the costs involved for the wake and funeral.

 Preparation for your untimely dismiss

While death is a taboo subject for many, we are starting to realise that planning our funeral services beforehand can help ease the load on your family members.
The benefits of being open and transparent with your family member about your funeral include:

Less emotional stress for your loved ones after your passing since everything is planned
Reduces unnecessary disputes and arguments amongst your family pertaining to decisions for the funeral
Allows you to plan financially for your own funeral effectively

Here are 5 steps that you can arrange for before death:

Deciding on a Funeral Director
Deciding on the details of the wake
Making a will
Making CPF nomination
A discussion with your direct family members


1. Deciding on a Funeral Director
A Funeral Director is a professional that helps take care of your funeral arrangements. He will be the go-to guy upon your passing if arrangements have been made.
We have attached a list of Funeral Directors in Singapore below for your convenience.

2. Deciding on the details of the wake
Once you have decided on the Funeral Director, it is good to make known the essential information to him to better facilitate the planning process of the funeral.
Some useful information will be the budget which you are looking at, your religion, your favourite flowers, casket and also other possible information. By having these details tied down prior to death can help ease the stress on your family. Family members usually have a short period of time to plan and prepare for the funeral, while dealing with the loss of their loved one.
Details such as the venue of the wake, photo-taking of the funeral photo and clothes you want to be wearing should be settled too.

3. Making a will
A will is an official arrangement for someone to receive part or all of your money and property after your passing.
In order for a will to be valid, here are some pointers to note:

The will must be made written
The person who wrote the will must be at least 21 years old
The person who wrote the will must sign at the bottom of the will
2 or more person must witness the person signing the will and must also sign to indicate that they have witnessed it
The witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the will or spouses of the beneficiaries

Writing a valid will can get quite complicated so we can consider hiring a professional like a lawyer to take care of it. OCBC and MoneyOwl are some platforms that we may approach to get our will done.
If you’re opting for a lawyer to draft your will for you will range from $200 to $500 depending on its complexity.

4. Making CPF Nomination
A CPF nomination allows us to specify who will benefit from their CPF savings and the amount our beneficiaries receive upon our demise. As CPF savings are not covered under our will, it is important to make a CPF nomination.
If there’s no CPF nomination made, the CPF savings will be transferred to the Public Trustee’s Office and distributed according to the rules in the Intestate Succession Act. And that is super leh chey (troublesome)!

5. Have a discussion with your direct family members
Once all the above are in place, it is time for us to have an open discussion with our family members on our liabilities if any and also assets.
Here is some helpful information to tie down:

Make known to them where they can find the necessary documentation to locate your assets upon your passing
Imagine having a will so well hidden that no one can ever find – that totally defeats the purpose of having a will! 
Decide who in the family will be in charge of ensuring that all your wishes are carried out accordingly – this includes your funeral home
Some may even go to the extent of having a contact list of who to be informed of your passing should it happen

Step-by-step guide: What to do when someone passes away?
Depending on the location of the death, is it in the hospital, at home, or overseas, each has its set of necessary steps to take.
Steps to take when death occurs in the hospital/ home

Step 1: Obtain Certificate of Cause of Death (CCOD) in the hospital
If the doctor at the hospital can certify the cause of death and the cause is natural, the doctor will fill up the Certificate of Cause of Death (CCOD).
Step 1: Obtain Certificate of Cause of Death (CCOD) at home
Contact the doctor or any neighbourhood doctor that is willing to take a house call to certify the death.

The rest of the steps are similar

If the cause of death unknown
If the doctor is unable to certify the cause of death, call the police to have the body sent to [email protected] (Singapore General Hospital, Block 9)
Step 2: Contact a funeral director
If there is already one assigned, simply contact the relevant Funeral Director. If not, the family will need to engage one.
The funeral director will collect the body, send the body for embalming and deliver to the location of the wake.
Step 3: Register the death
The family can register the death at any Police station or the Registry of Births and Deaths.
