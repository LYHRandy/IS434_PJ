3 min readWhile looking through my credit cards one day, I realised that the points and miles that I was accumulating on a couple of programmes were either expiring soon or the stuff that I could redeem for were damn cui.
40,000 points, or $4,000 spent, for an eco-friendly cup to hold coffee that I DON’T even drink in the mornings…
I’ll pass.
Miles sound great. But I’m not really a frequent traveller either. So how often will I earn enough miles for a flight, before my darned miles expire?
I decided then to switch to something more immediate. Something more tangible. I decided to find out what’s the best cashback credit card in Singapore.
Lucky for you, the team strong-armed me to I’m generously sharing the knowledge that I’ve gathered.
So the next time you walk into a bank or any credit card roadshow, this will be you:

Why Would The Banks Give Us Free Money?
The answer is in the fine print.
Most cash rewards programmes have a minimum spend requirement as well as a cashback cap. So while a card might offer you a generous 20% cashback, you’ll probably need to spend something like $50 a month in order to qualify, and the maximum amount of cashback you can probably get is $10,000 monthly.
FOR EXAMPLE ONLY, PLEASE. No such card exists.
But most consumers do not take the time to read the fine print, so there is a chance that they might use a credit card under the impression that the cash rewards programme is more generous or applicable to a wider range of expenditure than they actually are.
And how many of us really track how much we spend in order to truly maximise our cashback rewards?
I can’t imagine that it’ll be many…
Heck. Even I lose track sometimes. But I’ve got a brilliant solution for tracking my expenses. And I’ll share what it is in a bit.
So imagine what the experience is like for someone who has never owned a credit card, much less never bought groceries before:

There are also plenty of consumers who might be under the impression that because they’re getting cash back, they can ‘afford to’ spend more.
WRONG!
That’s really bad news because if you can’t make payment on time. The banks will charge high interest rates on credit, and the late fees for balances that are carried over are usually damn siao.
The lesson to take away here? Only get a credit card if you are conscientious about your spending habits and can make payments for your credit card bills on time.

“So what’s your secret for tracking your expenses to a T,” you ask?
By using the free Seedly Expense Tracker app, of course.

Give it a whirl. It’s a free app to help you get free money. #dontsaybojio
