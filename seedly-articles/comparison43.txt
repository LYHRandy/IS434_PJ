3 min readWhen I first heard there will be a Taobao physical store in Plaza Singapura, I was honestly so THRILLED!
To be frank, I was half expecting to see the clothes available for sale on racks or makeup brands, not sure what I was thinking.

In my head, I was hoping to able to see whatever that is on my Taobao app in person. Yes, it’s kinda true as NomadX has StyleTheory, Mamonde and more located inside as well.
For the huge space that NomadX dominates, Taobao is residing in a small segment of the second floor greeting us with this Instagram-worthy neonlights.

Though it may seem that the whole place is aesthetically-pleasing (we are all about the Instagram-able life right?), most of the products only for display and you can’t test it to see how it works but it’s great if you want to see if it fits into your dream home.
How to shop on Taobao physical shop?

Scan the QR code on the price tag
Make your purchase through the Taobao app
Wait for the product to be delivered to your place (yes, you can’t make a purchase in-store)

It doesn’t help if you don’t understand Chinese or don’t know how to work the Taobao app. That’s what we’re here for right? We’ve made a guide to help you make your first purchase on Taobao even if you don’t understand Chinese!
Taobao is known for its ability for the savvy consumer to snipe a cheaper deal.
However, what I’ve found on display at Taobao’s physical store were not the cheapest that you can find online.
Here are some examples:

Electronic Facial Cleansers
One of the cheaper items on display in Taobao’s physical store would be this electronic facial cleanser by Kingdom Cares.

Display Price: SGD 27.30 / CNY 138

These electronic facial cleansers are famously inspired by the FOREO Luna Mini 2 that was heavily publicised through influencer marketing as shown here.

Xiaomi devices in Taobao Physical Store
With so many Xiaomi stores in Singapore that you can visit to try out Xiaomi devices before purchasing, they still chose to display Xiaomi products anyway.
Here are some products that are on display:

Xiaomi Air Purifier
Xiaomi 720P 360 Camera
Xiaomi 1080P PTZ Camera
Xiaomi rice cooker

Nathome Aromatherapy Humidifier
Ever since the Muji craze over their minimalistic design for their humidifier, every e-commerce website starting selling inspired pieces that simply looks uncanny with the Muji ones as a cheaper alternative.
In this case, Nathome aromatherapy humidifier is displayed at Taobao physical store and it isn’t as cheap as the ones I have seen online.

Display Price: SGD 39.37 / CNY 199

Nathome Collapsible Travel Kettle
This next item is something that I was really amused by, a TRAVEL KETTLE. It is collapsible and allows it to not occupy much space in your luggage and YOU STILL GET HOT WATER.
This one’s for you if you always had trust issues with the kettles provided by the hotels or if your Airbnb does not provide you with a boiling kettle.

Display Price: SGD 39.37 / CNY 199

Because I could not live without looking for a cheaper alternative before committing to this collapsible kettle,
I found some cheaper alternatives although it is a different brand:

They have a pet segment
Yes, a segment for pets!!! Though a little small, you are able to look at fancy accessories for your pets before getting them on Taobao. And these aesthetically-pleasing accessories are mainly from Petkit.

If you are planning to make a trip down to NomadX,

It is located at level 1 Plaza Singapura, exit E of Dhoby Ghaut MRT;
Taobao X Qanvast can be found on Level 2 of NomadX

I think I spent more time queuing for Gongcha than I did around NomadX. *shrugs
