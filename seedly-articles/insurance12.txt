5 min readEver picture yourself on a motorbike weaving in and out of traffic? Maybe even cornering a tight bend?
In case you need help imaginingâ€¦ hereâ€™s Tom Cruise being all cool on that bike of his.

Â 
Oh and did you know? This scene was actually acted out by the man himself, TOM CRUISE. Thatâ€™s some mad skillz heâ€™s got there.Â 
Ok, thatâ€™s beside the point.
Anyway, Tom Cruise also acted out this scene in Mission Impossible: Fallout.Â

Where again, he was being all cool one moment before he collided with a car.
Although it was a movie, my point here is that if you ride a motorcycle, surely, anything can happen. And that is why you need motorcycle insurance.
If you are at least 18 years old, just passed your Traffic Police (TP) Class 2B test, and looking to purchase your first motorcycleâ€¦
Congratulations!
As you go about searching for a bike, you will also have to purchase motorcycle insurance. To help make things slightly easier, Iâ€™ve created this guide so you can get an idea of the various motorcycle insurance policies that are available to you and even compare to see which is the best for you.
TL;DR: Which Is The Cheapest (But Most Value For Money) Motorcycle Insurance?
This oneâ€™s a little subjective, but for me, I selected these options based on price (cheapest but it must give me the most value for money) as well as the amount of coverage it offersÂ me. Basically, which one gives me the most bang for my buck.
Presentingâ€¦
My Choice

TPO (Third Party Only): NTUC Income
TPFT (Third Party, Fire and Theft): Etiqa Insurance
Comprehensive: NTUC Income

Disclaimer: The ones that didnâ€™t make my choice does not mean that theyâ€™re not good. Some might be a little more expensive. But itâ€™s because they offer more protection and coverage for more kiasu riders. And thereâ€™re some that might provide perks which I donâ€™t feel that I need since Iâ€™m on a tight budget. So take my recommendations and do your due diligence to see which motorcycle insurance really is the best for YOU.
Some Assumptions To Find The Cheapest Motorcycle Insurance In Singapore

Before we actually go into the different motorcycle insurance policies offered by the different insurance companies (which is also one of the factors that affect insurance prices) letâ€™s begin with the factors that affect how motorcycle insurance policies are priced.
Your motorcycle insurance premium will vary due to these factors.
1. Age
The younger you are, the more expensive your insurance policy premiums will be. And itâ€™s probably because you are more inexperienced. Or for some riders, they might be more reckless. Not meâ€¦ Iâ€™m a safe and responsible rider. ðŸ˜€
2. Type Of Bike
Premiums for a sport bike will cost more than a street bike. Sport bikes are known to have more power as theyâ€™re purpose-built for speed. Insurance companies know that if you buy a fast bike, youâ€™re likely going to ride it fast. And riding fast means thereâ€™s a higher chance of injury (or death) which results in higher cost of insurance.
3. Year Of Registration Of Bike
The newer the bike, the more expensive the insurance.
And itâ€™s probably because older bikes have a higher probability of breaking down (especially if theyâ€™re not well-maintained or taken care of) and causing injury or fatality. So naturally, insurance companies would increase premiums to offset the increased risk of a loss.
4. Type Of Usage
Premiums for a bike that you use for commercial purposes (for eg. food delivery) will be more than one for personal use.
5. Previous Claim History And No-Claim Discount (NCD)
The more claims you have submitted, the more expensive the insurance.
Conversely, NCD, or No-Claim Discount, is an entitlement given to you if no claim has been made under your policy for a year or more under the current or existing insurer. Itâ€™ll only be valid as long as you stay with your insurer.
Think of it as a reward given to you every year for being a safe rider (more reasons to ride safe, ladies and gentlemen).
Currently, in Singapore, the maximum NCD you can get is NCD20 or 20% after 3 consecutive years of safe riding with no claims.
Motorcycle Rider Profile For Comparison
With all of the above in mind, hereâ€™s the motorcycle rider profile I submitted to get the various motorcycle insurance quotes:

18 years old
Male
Intending to purchase a second-hand Yamaha street bike that was registered in 2014, forÂ personal use only
Less than 2 years of riding experience (just passed 2B Traffic Police test that type) 
0% No Claim Discount

What Are The Types Of Motorcycle Insurance Available?
There are three types of motorcycle insurance available in the market.
To make it easier for you, I asked for quotes for all three options, from as many insurance companies as I can (with the above rider profile in mind) and included the cost of their premiums so you can have a better sense of which company to go with.Â 
However, price is not the only factor to consider! Some companies might be a little more expensive because they place more emphasis on better customer service or have built a reputation that lets you make your claims easier.
So itâ€™s always good to talk to your other friends to get some recommendations too! Alternatively, you can even ask our friendly Seedly community in our Seedly QnA!

Third-Party Only (TPO)
What is it: Third-party insurance is essentially a form of liability insurance to protect yourself against third-party claims. You, on the other hand, are still responsible for your own damage or losses, regardless of the cause of those damages. This is the minimum level of motorcycle insurance and also the most basic coverage you get. Third party insurance generally covers you for:

Third-party injury to a passenger or a person on another motorcycle 
Damage to another personâ€™s motorcycle 
Damage to another personâ€™s property

Why: This policy is to help defray the cost you need to pay for damages toÂ other people, vehicles, and property in the event of an accident that was deemed to be your fault.
Who is it for: Those who want to be insured against any claims from a third party only.

Third Party, Fire and Theft (TPFT)
What is it: Third party, fire and theft insurance provides the same coverage as TPO. On top of that, it also covers your motorcycle in case it gets damaged or destroyed in a fire, or even worse, stolen. TPFT generally covers you for:

SameÂ coverage as TPO
Damage that happens as a result of an attempted theft 
Damage that happens as a result of fire
Stolen bike

Why: Same reasons as TPO. However, you will also be insured against fire and theft situations.Â 
Also, if you park your bike in an area where there is a higher risk of your motorcycle being stolen or involved in a fire (accidental or not), then a third party, fire and theft policy could help to cover the cost or repairs or a replacement motorcycle. I mean, who will really know when the next fire might happenâ€¦ right?
Who is it for: Those who are looking for an in-between but still want additional coverage for fire and theft scenarios.

Comprehensive

What is it: Comprehensive motorcycle insurance is the highest level of cover you can purchase for you and your motorcycle. Comprehensive motorcycle insurance policies generally cover:

Same coverage as TPFT
Damage that happens as a result of an accident
Personal injuries resulted from an accident

Why: This policy is to provide you with complete coverage over any unforeseen circumstances.
Who is it for: For those who feel insecure if they are not well covered and for those who donâ€™t have any other form of insurance eg. personal insurance.
