Note: Discount Off Regulated Tariff Plans provide a fixed discount off the regulated tariff, but electricity rates will change in tandem with regulated tariff. These plans are for consumers who do not mind changes in electricity rates every quarter as long as it is lower than the regulated tariff.

Cash Rebate With POSB Everyday Card
Credit card promos change quite regularly. But the one card that offers cash rebates on most of the electricity retailers, and doesn’t seem to have an expiry for now. Is none other than the: POSB Everyday Card
If you do have the card, here’s a list of electricity retailers where you can enjoy 1% cash rebate if you set up a recurring payment using your POSB Everyday Card.

Best Electricity
Geneco
iSwitch
Tuas Power
Union Power

It’s not much, but hey, it’s still something right?
Just so you know, the cash rebate is credited by the end of the following calendar month on the month which the transaction is made. No cash rebates will be awarded beyond the maximum spend of S$100 every month, meaning the maximum cash rebate off electricity is S$1.
