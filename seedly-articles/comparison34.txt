2 min readA rental travel WiFi router is a cost-effective solution to stay connected to the internet while travelling. Especially if you’re not a fan of switching sim-cards or using your own data roaming (which can get really expensive).
Better still, if you are travelling in a group, you can split the cost of the WiFi egg as multiple devices can connect to it.

2. KKday
KKday offers an unbeatable rate of S$1 per day for Taiwan, and only S$4 per day for Hong Kong and Korea! The only catch? They don’t provide WiFi routers for a lot of popular tourist destinations outside of Asia.
Instead of the usual local self-collection or courier service, you’ll have to pick up and drop off your router at the overseas airport of your destination.

3. Klook
Any traveller worth his or her salt knows about Klook. Not only do they offer travel wifi routers, but they also sell day tours and overseas attraction tickets. Their prices are competitive and are the lowest in the market – aside from KK Day’s $1/day rate for Taiwan, of course.
Klook offers pick up at the respective airports of your choice, which is great for last-minute orders of WiFi rental. But it should be noted that the WiFi routers are not provided by Klook but providers that are marketed on their platform.
