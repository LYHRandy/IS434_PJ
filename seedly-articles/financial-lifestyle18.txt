It’s… FOOD!

Before you take the list and run out to the nearest restaurant to enjoy your 1-for-1 buffet promotion, here’re a few things you should do first:

Always check with the banks’ websites to read the terms and conditions as these can be changed anytime
When making reservations, remember to quote the bank and credit card which you are using to secure the discount (certain promos might be capped at a certain number of patrons per day or per seating)
Make sure you pay for your bill using the correct card in order to enjoy the 1-for-1 buffet credit card promotion

In my experience, the best time to go for a buffet is during a weekday lunch as that’s when the prices are the lowest.
But on the flip side, dinners usually offer a more luxurious spread, which is also why you’d be paying higher prices.
Your personal guide to the best 1-for-1 buffet dining promotions:

DBS/POSB 1-For-1 Buffet Dining Promotions
Citibank 1-For-1 Buffet Dining Promotions
HSBC 1-For-1 Buffet Dining Promotions
Maybank 1-For-1 Buffet Dining Promotions
OCBC 1-For-1 Buffet Dining Promotions

DBS/POSB 1-For-1 Buffet Dining Promotions
The majority of us would have a DBS/POSB card because it’s probably the first bank we all started with. Even if you don’t have one, it wouldn’t be too hard to find someone you know who would have a DBS/POSB card in order to unlock these 1-for-1 buffet credit card deals:

That being said, their 1-for-1 buffet dining deals aren’t too shabby either:

Pro Tip: For Those Who Want To Save Even More
While you take advantage of these 1-for-1 buffet deals, always remember to check ShopBack GO to see if any of these restaurants or establishments are on the platform.
If they are, make sure the card which you are using to pay for the 1-for-1 buffet is also linked to your ShopBack GO account.
That way, you’ll also be able to earn some additional cashback.
