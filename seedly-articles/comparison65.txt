A stint in Bloomberg gifted me with a beer belly, which only grew larger when I moved on to become a Professional Trader. Now I turn caffeine into digestible finance-related content. You can contribute your thoughts like Ming Feng here.


3 min readIf you are a couch potato like myself, binging Brooklyn Nine-Nine all day, food delivery evolved from a want to a need.
I vaguely remember the time when all we had was only Pizza and McDelivery. This makes my constant crave for local delicacies such as Bak Chor Mee and Nasi Lemak a pain in the arse, having to get out of the house for food. This problem is solved with the convenience of food delivery.
In this article, we compare all the 4 major food delivery service in Singapore to find out which is the cheapest.
Editorâ€™s note: In case you are wondering, or am a new reader of Seedlyâ€™s content, we do not do sponsored post. Hence, the information is unbiased. ðŸ™‚


TL;DR â€“ honestbee has zero delivery charges, Deliveroo and foodpanda have the most number of partners
Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the food delivery charges.



Food delivery service providerFood delivery feeMinimum Order Value




foodpandaS$3 with minimum order depending on restaurantsS$12


DeliverooS$3 with minimum order of S$12S$12


GrabFoodS$1.99 on top of price of menu itemNone


HonestbeeS$1.95S$15




Given that GrabFood is rather new, the number of merchants is difficult to find out and unfair to compare at this stage.
GrabFood and honestbee have no minimum order.
Amongst the three other food delivery services, honestbee has the least amount of choice for consumers.
honestbeeâ€™s free delivery, however, gives them an advantage in terms of price comparison against its competitor.
Each merchant has their individual on-going free delivery promotion, which makes it even harder for the consumer to compare unless they know exactly what they want to eat.
Each food delivery service has their own partners which means a certain vendor found in Deliveroo may not be available in honestbee, etc.

When it comes to user experience when using various platforms to order my food delivery:

GrabFood is only available on mobile unlike its competitor who is available on both.
When it comes to shopping experience on mobile, we personally prefer Deliveroo and Foodpandaâ€™s mobile app. Both apps areÂ rather user-friendlyÂ and easy to use.

Editorâ€™s Note: Food delivery and personal finance
With the advancement in technology, there is this constant encourage to spend in exchange for convenience.
One good personal experience was ride-sharing. Due to the convenience of hailing a ride at a seemingly lower cost, my frequency of expenses on ride-sharing app increases. It was until the user of a personal finance tracker that my expenses on transport alone doubled to about S$200 per month. Imagine saving up that extra S$100 per month over a year.
While it is good to be rewarding yourself once in a while with home-delivered meals, do take into account the minimum spend and delivery fees that one might be spending on. On top of that, there are tools available in the market that can help you save more such as cashback platforms and cashback cards.
