You seriously need a review on your spending habits.1) Cut your credit card so you can't buy on credit any more.2) Look at your fixed expenditures. Set aside income to pay for these essential stuff3) Cut unnecessary spendings which are not a NEED. You can drink your bubbletea 3 months later.4) Look for a trusted friend to DRILL this into you. STOP unnecessary spending. (you will probably hate this friend for at least the next few months).5) Discipline yourself. starting from now. Start paying off all credit card debts and refinance with personal loan (which has lower interest rate).0 comment\n",

The accelerating feature will kick in during your economic years.. so they are like term enhancement. \r\n",

Now it is already Apr 2019 and I have received the monetary payout till Mar 2019. All of the money invested are well documented and all payout are given a payment invoice and also a paper contract with your investment. Plus all dividends are paid to you via bank transfers. All payments recorded. The company not only doing the day trading under FX Primus platform. They have a shipping and bunkering business with Oceanport which has offices in singapore and Hong Kong and they owned Ships. They have a car showroom under DJ Automobile in gambas . They have a F&B outlet Eaterz at Arab street. They have a logistics company under AA logistics. They have an Interior design comapny under Amiris the home decor. They have a financial literacy education arm under Impetus Academy and also a pomade business under beard zooka. The list is still expending. I am sure you all would have heard and seen videos of day traders earning millions a year from doing trades. This is exactly that. if you feel this is a scam up to you.

ProdigyUpdated on 07 Jun 2019Hi I understand how you felt as I was previously in your shoes as well.I have no idea where to start and when i was approached by FAs they only suggested ILP which I'm not very interested in. The simple reason why I'm against ILP is the lock-in period and the limited controls i have over the plans. I dont deny the fact that it actually generates quite a good return (7-10%) but I rather have more control. To answer your question: I would recommend you to do your own research and start investing yourself and not depend on FAs (I dont mean they are bad but why 'pay' FAs when you can do it yourself)Monthly RSP. One of the lower risks in investment. However it also means lesser returns.Blue chips stocks.

      "Question Poster07 Feb 2019Thanks for the summary! Many people have mentioned the STI ETF does not provide good returns. What are your thoughts on it?Nicholes Wong07 Feb 2019They dont provide the good return because thats true. No choice singapore market not very big after all. I think that investing globally is good for index/ETFs investing and SGX is good for dividend investing. We dont really have much ETFs in Singapore and they are mostly low volume and higher ask bid spread as well. STI ETF have only 30 companies and it favors the banking industry alot because majority of the STI ETF is in DBS\n",

Unfortunately one of my competitor (a company) offered commission rebate to entice customers to buy products from them. I lost all my prospects to them and I didn't earn anything for 3 months. I was so fed-up / desperate that I started charging advisory fee. Strangely my business grew significantly after I started charging fee. Now all my referrals expect me to charge or else they will not trust me. So there was no turning back since.\r\n",

This is because the World Equities Fund level fees have come down from 50bps last year to 43bps this year as a result of greater scale and cost-efficiency which is being passed on to our clients. This is why Endowus and Moneyowl love to use Dimensional as they are completely aligned with our values in returning as much to the clients as possible. Thank yo\n",

      "See all 4 comments AWAdrian Wong10 May 2019Not to be quoted. But I think their performance is reasonable. I set on with a highest risk profile. Started September. During the trader war end of the year in December January market was bad and it went to -8%. From that the market bounced and I am at +6% up now. It‚Äôs better compared to MAPS with Fundsupermart which I think is human managed. MAPS goes no where to be honest. Waiting to pick up and move it to Stash.Qingling Wu13 May 2019Thanks Gabriel and Adrian\n",

Today I use interactive brokers to purchase overseas ETFs as it's much more affordable than local brokerages. You can DCA into a few overseas ETFs each month using this platform.

(0.4%)Endowus: 0.6% (p.a) + fund mgmt fees (0.4% - 0.5%)Clearly the trend is between 1-1.2% p.a choosing either ETF or unit trusts. ETF's also have 30% tax on dividend which unit trusts don't. Cheapest seams to be Endowus under unit trusts and auto wealth for ETF's Many thanks0 comment\n",

      "YCYewFong ChuaLevel 3. WonderkidUpdated on 18 Aug 2019Would recommend using CIMB FastSaver instead of OCBC 360 account. The reasons are as follows: 1) OCBC requires you to credit your salary of at least S$2000 through GIRO. (Which your company provide your salary as cheque will not meet the requirement)2) You need to increase your account balance by S$500 compared to the previous month then you are entitled to the Step-Up bonus. 3) If you are looking for pure saving without applying any credit card to spend at least S$500 to hit the minimum requirement. Then CIMB FastSaver is the right one to choose. You might want to check out using the Seedly saving account calculator and the best saving account to do your own diligence:https://seedly.sg/tools/savings-account-calculatorhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.seedly.sg/best-savings-accounts-singapore/amp/0 comment\n",

RookieUpdated on 07 Jun 2019My PSLE score was 176.Today i'm a 22 year old degree holder working my first proper job at Seedly as an intern and I honestly never thought I'd be doing what i'm doing given my PSLE score.I was a an NA kid and sadly attended a school that to me felt extremely discouraging.My N level score was 19 points.However I am extremely blessed to have parents who sent me overseas for my high school and university education.I now hold a B.A from the University Of Melbourne and doubled majored in Media & Communications and Screen & Cultural Studies. My grades when I was younger definitely affected my but i'm glad to say that they did not define me :-)Excited to see where this journey of adulting takes me!1 commen\n",

I run a financial comparison site before so I would always encourage user to compare the rate. There is no fee or obligation to sign up the product so it‚Äôs relatively straight forward (though you need to wait for your approval)\n",
